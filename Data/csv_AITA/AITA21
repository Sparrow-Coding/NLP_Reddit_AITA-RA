We moved so that I could be closer to my family for support (we have two children – 6 and 2). We previously lived in his home town. He often takes annual leave in the children’s school holidays and usually comes home or we have a few times used this time to travel abroad. We often visit the in laws and stay over night at their place when he’s home.

When he is away, my mum does the childcare I need so that I can stay in my job. She also makes dinner pretty much every night (unless I’m working from home and then I’ll make dinner) and we eat with her. My mum and my brothers have been a huge support to me and my family. Including my brother taking time off work to move all our stuff with the removals as I couldn’t due to my son being very little and my brothers picking him up from stations etc. 

My MIL and SILs have in the past done some awful things to me and made multiple accusations about me and my mum/family. The last time was earlier this year when they started shouting at me in my own house while my husband was away accusing me of all sorts including taking their son/brother away and how I need to be listening to them and visiting them every few weeks etc. They live 2 hours away. This has made me not want to see them anymore unless my husband is around. To be honest, I never feel like he’s ever on my side and I feel like he puts them first and doesn’t take my feelings into account.

He’s home at the moment. My mum lives about 100 metres away, he hasn’t gone to say hi to her (in our culture, respect of our elders is huge, especially of in laws), despite her doing nothing wrong to him.

She met my father (46M) when they were both working at my grandfather's law firm. My mom was just a young intern and my das was very important there, being the boss' son. She also met Jenny, who was a secretary working at the firm, but had no interest in law and wanted to be an actress.

When me mother got pregnant with me, Jenny also got pregnant with an older rich man she was seeing at the time. The issue was that the man didn't want to have anything to do with the baby and would have prefer her to have an abortion. She decided to keep it and my mother became even more closer with her, being pregnant at the same time. At that point, my grandfather died, and my dad inherited a lot of money. Jenny became really sad after her baby, Stacy, was born and wasn't up to fully acting as a mother so she moved in with my parents and my mom was the one that take care of both me and her baby. My dad also help all he could, by the way, but he was busy working a lot at the time. My mom finished school, she passes her bar exam being 8 months pregnant, but never ended up working as lawyer after that.

Jenny got better with her mental heath and keep trying to get work as an actress, without much success. So, when I was 7, she moved out from our house with her daughter because she found a role in an off-off-broadway production. Stacy and I had been raised as basically sisters and were best friends, but we were also little girls so it wasn't something really deep, I think. My mom keep having a lot of contact with them and visit then at least once a year but I mostly forgot about Stacy. I went with my mom to NY a few times in her visits and we watch Jenny on her show when I was 13. It was terrible, in my opinion.

Earlier this year, a job opportunity came for Jenny about being in a televisiom show in Romania but she would have to be there for at least a yeat and could't bring Stacy. So, my mom offered her to let her stay with us. My mom was really happy about it but I was mostly indifferent. She has been really intense with me since her arrival, wanting to reconnect as when we were kids. I don't want to be rude but I am really shy and calm, while she is really loud. She is always in my room because she says she is too used to share a small room with her mom and does not like being alone in her own big bedroom in our house.

So I went ahead and told Lesly about it, trying to watch out for my girl, and she told me it’s totally fine because she’s in an open relationship with Steve. I let Sara know that it’s ok because it’s an open relationship, but she was upset that she was never told by Steve that he’s in an open relationship. Then when she asked him why he never told her, he said he didn’t feel that he had to, even though they talked for weeks and went on a date (nothing sexual happened fyi). We found that odd but we moved on. The following week, Lesly asks me to go out for dinner with her and her friends, Steve would be there too. To my surprise, Steve called me out on telling Lesly that he went out on a date with my friend, and called me a snitch! He also called Sara crazy for thinking she had the right to know about his open relationship, and I disagreed. Meanwhile, Lesly, my close friend of many years, took her new boyfriend’s side, and now I am no longer speaking to either of them. I just don’t understand how I’m the bad guy here.

He professed his love for me immediately and told me he wanted to marry me. At my age, I found it romantic that he was so invested in me so quickly. Now I see it differently.

We instantly started getting some legal documents seeing as I am not in my country. We are in his. I spent a lot of money and time getting everything. I even had to involve my brother back home because I couldn't get the docs myself. In my culture we never introduce boyfriends so it was a big deal. 

After I got them, he didn't seem to want to move forward with our plans. He never looked up venues, suits, rings, nothing. I'm the only one who seemed to care. I told him multiple times to let me know if he didn't want to go through with it seeing as I had the opportunity to move to another country within 2 years. He insisted that he wanted to marry me and often got angry when I questioned him.

2 years later, as the deadline for me to make the decision to move neared, he FINALLY proposed officially. I was so excited and I could finally tell my parents about it because again, we don't do boyfriends in my culture. 
It was the happiest day of my life. I felt he had finally committed to me. I told everyone about it. But then it was all replaced with dread as again, he didn't make any plans. He never mentioned the wedding. He always acted like he didn't know that we were supposed to get married. 

It has brought me shame, disappointment and heartache. I'm kind of a people pleaser, and I feel so ashamed to tell people that I'm not getting married after all. I feel that that's a big reason why I stayed with him so long. I just don't want to tell everyone that I want to end things. I feel a lot of pressure to continue our relationship even though I've felt mentally checked out. I feel that in the eyes of everyone we are already married. Splitting up would be like a divorce and we don't do that either. 

This has taken a big toll on our relationship. The deadline to move passed and I was still stuck. I now feel stuck because it is hard for me to move with my passport (it is not very strong). This opportunity was the best thing I had. I've gotten the necessary documents 4 times now. I've had to spend ALL day in another city each time. Each time it goes to waste because he's not ready. 

I feel like he only proposed to trap me here. And now, I have no other options. I've grown resentful of him. I've broken up with him many times but he always convinces me to stay. Last month, I broke up with him again, but because of how often I've mentioned breaking up with him, I don't think he believes it. We live together so that complicates things.

He acts as if we haven't broken up but we're just roommates IMO. I joined Badoo about 3 days ago. I haven't mentioned, not because I feel like I'm cheating, but because I think it would be awkward.

I’m hosting TG this year and everyone is excited. My house is in a warm location near beaches so everyone in the family is excited to get out of the cold and dig their toes into sand. My family is large and as expected, we all fall under different parts of the political spectrum. We might not agree with each other on some issues but we treat each other with respect and love. That is, except for my sister Kari and her husband Bob. 

They strongly believe in their politics and view anyone who doesn’t agree with them as being wrong and need to be taught to be correct. Even family members who are in the same political party are wrong if they’re not in 100% agreement on every issue. Every get together turns into a heated debate with them on one side against everyone else even with the people who vote as they do. Frankly, it’s exhausting and life draining just to be in the same room with them.

To head off any political debate this year, I included in the invitation email a ban on political discussions and a request for a monetary deposit of $500 (I picked this amount because everyone can afford it but I wanted it to be a painful loss if they lose it). I stated that this money will be returned at the end of the night if politics are not discussed. Whoever brings up politics will lose their deposit. Everyone agreed and sent me the money except for Kari and Bob. They replied that this was stupid and they don’t have to pay a deposit to come to a family gathering. I answered since it’s my house, it’s my rules. We went back and forth until I got tired of it and uninvited them. 

I’m here because they have children who will be affected by my decision and my parents are trying to talk me out of it. They want to see all of their grand children and they think it’s cruel to prevent Kari’s from coming. They even offered to cover Kari’s deposit but I firmly told them no.

I asked her if she expected the guy to pay and she ghosted me. So I found her on IG, watched her story, and then asked if she would let me take her out for dinner. She agreed.

She was really pretty and we kissed at the end of the date. I asked her to meet again, but this time I just said meet, and SHE suggested the place. She has no car also so I had to drive 15 minutes to see her.

When the check came, she looked at me and asked me if I would get it. I said no, and explained how I believe in equality. She started crying. Her excuse for crying? She said me not paying ""made her feel like she wasn't worth it"", whatever that means.

She then asked if it was because I didn't have enough money and I told her that no, it was simply the principle of equality. She gave me a snobby look and then I explained that I have lots of other women that are into me.

So the waitress came and we both put our cards in I (rightfully) locked my card beforehand so that her card would get charged for the whole thing. When she found out that her card was charged for the whole meal, this girl was furious at me for no reason, again I just wanted equality and had paid for everything the first time.

I was even a gentleman and walked her home to her house down the street, but she just huffed and puffed and rejected me when I asked to put my arms around her. I told her that sometimes couples fight and that I couldn't have read her mind since I didn't know I was supposed to pay again on the second date.

I told her I had to go to the bathroom so she said ""Fine, go"" angrily and then after I went, I took off my socks and she said ""Did I say you were staying? then she kicked me out. I asked her if she would at least come out in the driveway to talk about it, but she refused.

I even texted her a week later saying how cute and interesting I thought she was, and that I was hoping we could kiss a bit for the second date. She has just completely ghosted me all because I simply stood up for myself and advocated equality.

Things happened we ended up moving in with MIL. MIL had her own dog at the time, they got along semi-well. Lab was our baby we took her everywhere. MIL was/is constantly at work. She has 2 jobs, start at 8am finish at 12am sometimes later. There were little things that kind of put me off like one day MIL shows up with $60 biscuits for Lab, she would take Lab out of our room at 1am most nights and would lock Lab in her own room, would feed her at 5am. Telling me when to bath Lab, when Lab has sensitive skin etc. a whole lot of controlling things? We had the chance of moving into our own home! But we had to stay elsewhere from MILs. so we asked MIL if we could leave Lab with her and MIL agreed. We went over most days to see Lab. Lab ended up with rashes from lollies and a spray, she was learning unhealthy habits and more.

Fast forward, we finally get our own home, with Lab allowed! after 5 months. We told MIL that we were taking Lab finally and she said “Lab is my dog! I looked after her” “she only knows my home, not yours” “she doesnt know you guys” but we seen Lab nearly everyday! SO and MIL got into a HUGE argument that involved his whole family. They told him to take what was his and leave each other alone. So he took Lab. MIL sent her SO over to pick Lab up, he said she was crying on the phone to him. We cried for Lab. We didnt see Lab for a month and then MIL decided to bring Lab over randomly. I noticed Lab was absolutely unhealthily overweight. Lab stayed with us all day. MIL picked Lab up again at 2am the next morning bc again she had work. This happened for a whole week. Then she decided to stop, and Lab ran away and wound up at the pound. MIL called us and asked us to pick Lab up so we did.. The following weeks were on and off, I asked SO to tell his mum that we didnt want her here. She wants Lab, she can take care of her. MIL ended up moving again, into a new home where she wasnt allowed animals. She asked us to take Lab for the day while she had an inspection but I said no. So Lab stayed in her car ALL DAY while she was inside her office at work. 

Fast forward to now. We got a new pup. We moved out of our house and ended up back at MILs as SO begged. I feed, walk, wash, brush, play, train and more with the both of them so They get along so well! I called the vets (as it was our puppies yearly check in) and bc it was the same vets as Labs I asked about when her last visit was. (3yrs ago! So I took her with our pup. They told me Lab was limping because of her weight and to put her on a diet, run her even more. Lab has lost loads of weight! 

I have been talking with SO about this. I want to take Lab with us when we leave. Lab is totally traumatised. Shes not the same here as when she was with us when we had our own home.

Breakup was amicable and mutual and we both were polite and made the split easy (I let her keep all the house stuff, she helped me get a new place by attending house inspections for me while I worked etc) but we are no contact. I haven’t been specifically avoiding her but she has made efforts to not be around me or avoid running into me. 

I’ve always had a really good relationship with her family and I have been no contact with my own family for basically the duration of my relationship with ex. They were awful abusive people so they aren’t apart of my life. I’ve spent every Christmas and other “family” type event with her family for 8 years and I get along with her parents and family extremely well. I’d visited them and stayed with them while on work trips and other such various things without my partner. I’ve got a key to their place so I can go there if they aren’t home if I need to stay somewhere. I’ve also visited them (been invited) a few times since the breakup. 

Both of exes parents invited me today to their Christmas (or rather assumed I would attend). Insisting I’m family etc and that both of us can simply “suck it up” and deal with each other for that day. I really want to go because honestly not going means spending Christmas home alone. I told them it feels like abit of a dick move on my part as they are *her* family and I know she won’t want me there. Ex and I have not communicated for months and after the breakup we originally were going to or she implied a few times “if I need anything I can still contact her” Then once I moved out she blocked me on all platforms and her best friend told me it would be best for us to not speak to each other (ie don’t reach out) . I know for sure attending will piss ex off greatly. Her parents have insisted I’m 100% welcome and that I should stay, that it’s their place and their decision to make and my ex has no say. there’s also a few other non-immediate family members attending who didn’t really have anyone to spend Christmas with.

I love those boys and consider them mine and  we’re now expecting our first child together soon. The problem is he also has 3 more kids from his most recent ex ( 2 by blood one adopted ) their relationship was very toxic and in the end she choose to leave him take everything they owned plus her own 3 kids and leave the boys behind. She was then receiving child support money for the 2 kids they shared although he was still there for all of the kids, tried staying active in their lives and talked to them as much as possible while he was deployed, but she eventually filled for full custody of her kids while he was away cuz she didn’t want to co-parent with him. Keep in mind he did everything she asked him to do whenever she asked for gas money or money for one of the kids clothes food games ect he gave it to her on top of the child support that should’ve covered it. 

 Then some time later my husband got a raise at his job and she decided she wanted more money for child support then she was getting and took him to court to force him to pay her more. After my husband gave receipts on all the money he was giving her on top of the child support, The judge ruled that she was already getting way more than the agreed amount and so he won’t be increasing the CS amount cuz he also has other kids to take care of, further more my husband will no longer supply her with extra money since he shouldn’t have to pay for her lifestyle as well as the kids.

Now fast forward we get married, are expecting our first child together, and every couple months she begs my husband for a couple hundreds so she can make rent or afford something for the kids, she gives us sob stories that she needs help and she’ll pay us back but everytime we’ve lent her money there’s a reason she can’t pay us back and we have to let it go. She’s even gone as far a getting her kids to ask for money for her, so they can have wifi or electricity or whatever… she also begs my father in law for money and says it’s for his grandkids.

We were at the checkout and my Dad was having a bit of trouble with one of his credit cards (he kept getting the pin wrong). If the pin is incorrect the shop assistant needs to come over to clear it and let us try again. 

It happened a second time, and sometime when the shop assistant came over, I said “Did you forget the pin?” to my Dad. 

Don’t really remember how he responded but then the shop assistant asked, “Are you sure Mum doesn’t know?” while looking at me. If this matters (and I don’t think it should), I was not dressed up, no makeup and was in sport shorts and a t-shirt with a jacket. 

I was really annoyed but didn’t say anything because he walked away and I don’t think my Dad caught it because he was pretty busy with my brother talking to him and the pin. 

Now that I’m home I’m really annoyed because this has happened a couple of times since I was 16 (in different instancs obviously) so I want to make an official complaint.

Apparently my girlfriend, who I had knew for 6 months, started dating the new kid (well call him Mage who was 14 I think). Mage and I had been close ever sense we met and I thought we were friends. But during the whole time I was dating May, Mage had been dating her to. And during the last day I was sick, she sent me a paragraph describing how she felt and how we were breaking up. Later a friend told me about May and Mage. For backstory I was chubby in 8th grade and when she broke up with me I starved myself and didn’t eat lunch so people would like me more. It was horrible for my state of mind and I was at a lowest point. Then a couple days ago, she sends my a TikTok about how I should smile more, like wtf, you broke up with me and cheated on me with my best friend, what gives you the right to tell me to smile more. After I called her out on this she sent me another paragraph about how she didn’t cheat on me. Here’s the text I got from her, am I the asshole. 

Are you trying to guilt trip me? cause it ain't gonna work. and no, I did not cheat on you. Cheating is What Is Infidelity? Infidelity, or cheating, is the act of being unfaithful to a spouse or other partner. It typically means engaging in sexual or romantic relations with a person other than one's significant other, breaking a commitment or promise in the act.

I didn’t make any long-lasting friends but I’ve had a few that stuck with me since highschool and we only hang out sometimes. I met my girlfriend (23f) in my junior year of college and we’ve been dating since.

My girlfriend has always been sort of dependent, we’ve talked about it and her answer has always been “I guess I should hang out with more people.” Which I’m obviously fine with. She was always a popular person but her college friends moved away and she’s stuck here doing medical school. We’ve been wanting to move to another city to meet more people and experience more of life instead of the limits of the college town.

As I mentioned before, she’s always been dependent. In the early days of dating, if I didn’t tell her whether I was coming over or not every day, she would freak out and start crying. I know I should have been more communicative but it felt like she was making me feel guilty for not wanting to come over to her place at the end of the every day. That problem quickly subsided when I moved in with her. We’ve been living together for about 3 years. 

When I would stay up and play games with my friends late at night, she would be sobbing in the room because she felt that I “liked them more than (her)” I would console her and promise to play earlier, which I would. But it would result in the same outcome. This has happened multiple times until I just gave up on playing late at night. Which is a good thing (admittedly) for productivity.

Another example is when I want to hang out with one of my close friends from highschool, she would also be sad or crying if I spend too much time with them because she thinks I like them more than her. So I feel guilty whenever I do things without her.

Now I don’t go out much unless it’s with her and her friends from med school who I don’t have much in common with. I want to make more friends but it feels like if I do anything alone I’m hurting her (my gf). I know she wants to make more friends and her time is taken up by medical school but she still hangs out with her friends more than I do with my friends. And since my only friends are barely available I’m left alone in the house. If I would casually mention that I got invited to something she would say things like “don’t go to parties without me :(“
Which, for the sake of my relationship I just put off as playful neediness. But I know that I want to experience more of life without her. It’s the guilt that bothers me.

I(15f) am in 10th grade. In class we were tasked with preparing a presentation about any topic as long as it has to do with the subject and we couldn’t be more than 3 people (we could work alone though). My ‘friend’ K(15f) asked me to be in a group with her at the beginning of the semester and I agreed. It is important to note that K has always gotten into petty fights over the tiniest things with our classmates and the teachers ever since we were in 5th grade. For example she made my best friend S(15f) cry over a typo or told me to kms for no reason while I was having dark thoughts. But she didn’t really have a fight with anyone for 2 years so we thought she stopped. This year we swapped classes and the only girls I know in my new class are S and K. S had decided to work alone and that’s completely fine. 2 weeks ago K had asked T(15f) if she wanted to be in our group and she accepted. That day we had agreed to meet at my house this morning at 12 pm and that K would get the materials we’ll need for the topic we chose. At 11:13 T said that she’ll be a bit late which is understandable as she’s on the other side of the city. At 11:30 K said she’s not coming. She didn’t give us an explanation until 12:15 when she said that she had tutoring sessions. We were planning on presenting this Wednesday too, so that made T and me very mad because we were relying on her as she had promised to get the things we needed. T left the group and I told K that I’ll be working alone too. But then my dad got the idea that I should ask T if we should work on another topic together. She liked the idea and we informed K that we’ll be working together and I said that we’re telling her so she doesn’t get surprised when we start presenting together on Wednesday. K absolutely lost it. She accused T of stealing me and me not wanting to tell her until we present (which makes no sense… why would we tell her if we were planning on surprising her?). T and I tried to explain to her that we were unable to rely on her after what she did and she kept cussing me out until about an hour ago where she said that we’re overdramatic and that we should basically f\*\*k off.

Idk what compelled me to do so, if it was my wanna-be-biologist brain (I’m in the middle of getting my BS in biology) or my religious upbringing in which I was taught to treat all living beings with respect and that even corpses retain a certain amount of dignity.

So I used a doggy bag as a glove, picked the dead mouse up, said a short prayer in its name, and put it to rest on the ground within a bunch of shrubs.

As I was leaving the bushes with my dog a gardener for the public park walks up to me and very loud and angrily starts to berate me and cuss me out as to why I would throw trash/dog poo into the area he just swept (he had a large broom in his right hand). I try to explain to the dude what I did and that the insects on the ground and the plants will take care of the dead animal and that it wasn’t trash nor dog poo that I threw into the bush. As soon as he hears that it was a dead mouse he screams “all the more reason to throw it in the garbage, it’s dead!” At this point my tone of voice is raising as I try to explain the circle of life and all, after a long argument of each of us repeating ourselves he turns around curses at me and walks away.

I excitedly told my family and my sister-in-law (30F) asked if she could be my wedding planner. She said that she has showed some interest in it and wanted to use my wedding as a test run. I gently declined, explained that we wanted a very small and intimate wedding and while I would still love for her to be involved in some of the planning I didn’t need a planner. I kept my word, I asked her to be one of my bridesmaids, her daughter (1F) to be our flower girl and have included her in everything the other bridesmaids were included in. For some background I was one of her bridesmaids when she got married to my brother, while I was excited, I wasn’t included in anything that the other bridesmaids were included in. She told me what color to get my dress in, what time to be there to help set up, and who I was walking with and that was it. So knowing that feeling I made damn sure I didn’t do the same to her. A month ago I made appointments for my fiancé and I to look at venues, because my mom offered to pay for the venue as a wedding gift she was invited and so was my MOH. We made a day of it, took lots of photos and my mom asked all the right questions that I didn’t even think to ask. We had a great time and my mom posted our selfies all over her Facebook excitedly. Please note, this was just the four of us, none of my bridesmaids were invited to this particular part of the planning. A week later I had gone to my brothers house to catch up with my SIL and visit my niece, she asked questions about the venues I looked at and what I was leaning towards more. As I was explaining it to her she had to change the baby and while gone my brother blew up on me about how horrible I was being to her and how upset she was that she wasn’t invited to look at venues with me. He said I was an AH especially because she offered to be our wedding planner. I tried to explain that I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings but it was hard to get a word in and he “yelled” at me about this up until she came back where I quickly said my goodbyes and went home.

my mum had a liver surgery on 11/11/2022. she’s been dealing with a chronic liver illness for 10+ years and she finally found a doctor who would perform surgery to relieve her pain. this operation would be very intense and there was an extremely huge chance she wouldn’t make it. my mum’s surgery went well but her heart stopped in the recovery room so she was resuscitated. spent 2 days in the icu and when she was warded, i stayed with her for the entire duration (6-7 days) to look after her 24/7. 

we just got home yesterday and things are still hectic as we try to adjust to our new lives and make her life less difficult while dealing with surgical pains. i’m also barely sleeping because i’m worried she may have complications (dying in her sleep, having a fever, infection, overall discomfort).
_________________________________
all this combined, has resulted in me texting and seeing my boyfriend a lot less, despite seeing him for 3 days in a row before and on the day of my mum being transferred to the ward. 

i’m currently on semester break which means i should be seeing and texting him more often. i promised i’d do so too. but since my mum’s in the hospital, i haven’t been able to upkeep that promise. but i tried my best to be patient and loving with his needs while dealing with this. 

he’s said things like “it’s not like we’re ever meeting” which i can understand his frustration for not seeing me for over a week. i think he feels like since i promised to see him while i’m currently on a school semester break , that means i should see him more often .

 i also let him know that i was upset at him for never once asking me if i’m okay and if i needed anything after knowing my mum practically died (and was resuscitated) and is in the hospital. he was just more upset at the fact that i’ve not been replying often.

 i just feel like he’s being selfish but in his perspective, i promised to see him while i’mnot tired down by school and other responsibilities so he should get to see me even more often. so honestly am i the asshole here for not giving him as much attention as i promised him?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4808494,public,top,self,AITA for not keeping my promise of seeing my boyfriend more often even though my mum’s in the hospital?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z021ah/aita_for_not_keeping_my_promise_of_seeing_my/,all_ads,6,,,

To start off my friend Nelly (14F) is staying at my house (14F) during the school holidays because her parents had some business. At first, it's all good and well **until** the 3rd day. We made a plan to go shopping the night before but I told her suddenly that morning that I lowkey didn't want to go shopping anymore because I'm feeling tired (not to mention we already go out the day before and need to go out again the next day to buy some supplies for school) and she said something along the line ""If that's what you want then I'll just follow you"" like, super vague.

I ask her again ""Well I don't wanna go but do **you** really want to?"" because in my mind maybe if she really really wants to go then she could just go alone. She still insists that she will just follow my decision, but I know that she is disappointed and annoyed by her sarcastic tone, and in the end, we did go shopping because I thought that I need to take care of her feelings. Everything is going pretty well until she decides that we should go eat in this one restaurant inside the mall that is a little bit more expensive and packed than the one I frequently visit.

I'm a bit hesitant, but I just follow her along. Maybe all of this is not really a big problem IF ONLY we didn't **chase the time**. During waiting for the food, my father called to tell me that he's gonna pick me up from the mall and I was anxious as hell because our food didn't show signs of showing up and it was hella pricey to just miss the pizza. She knows that I'm trying to hurry up but she is still pretty relaxed while I'm calling my father a few times to inform him about how the food still didn't came.

It's not like I want her to be as anxious as me but it just feels like she didn't respect my time, seeing how she didn't even ask me if my father is okay with waiting for us but instead just scrolled her phone the whole time. To me, that is pretty rude but whatever. I was mad but I decided to not say anything. So yeah, we finally done about 1 hour later and it's a relief that my father didn't really care about it so I thought it would just end there.

But there were a few things that happened after I got home that pissed me off, like how my mother and sister kept telling me to go call her to eat every time and there's this one occasion that I was waiting for Nelly to eat together for quite a long time only to found out she's scrolling her phone the whole time in my room. I also don't know what's wrong with Nelly because when I invite her to eat, she always replies in a quite cold and monotone voice while showing an annoyed face.

I feel like there is no single person in this house whether my family or Nelly that treats me with respect. I need to watch my word and lie every damn time and it feels suffocating. I also got beaten and misunderstood by my mother because of something Nelly did.

Context: For every holiday, My mother would ask the women in the family (my sisters, sister in-law, my wife, my female cousins) to send ""samples"" of the desserts they plan to bring to the celebration for testing and to see if these desserts could make it to the ""food menu"". My wife has been complaining about my mother deliberately rejecting every dessert sample she sends. So many times my mother has told her that she's being honest and keeping the guests best interest at heart. Yet my wife still thought that my mother is deliberately excluding her since 2 of her dessert samples were rejected before.



For this year's Christmas my mother is doing the same thing but this time, she told every woman who are participating to make a ""cookie sample"" and send it to her for testing. My wife took it as a challenge and to be honest she worked really hard to make a good sample and sent to my moyher days ago and the results just came in yesterday.


I came home from work and found my wife upset. I asked what's wrong and she told me that my mother rejected the sample she sent and decided to exclude her baking from the food list for christmas this year. I didn't know what to say but she then told me she was backing out of the invitation to attend christmas with my family. I was stunned when I heard her make this statement. I tried to talk to her but she said ""it was done"" I called her unreasonable to decide to bail on the whole family over some cookie sample...that's just freaking crazy and quite unreasonable. We had a full on argument about it and she stated that my mother caused this but I told her that my mother is pretty serious and careful about the food she offers to the guests since we are going to have relatives coming from all sides of country. She told me to stop mentioing it.


Later I heard her cry despite telling her that her baking is amazing and people have preferences that's all.

We get along really well despite our differences.

We've never managed to go out together in those 3 years because of her living far away.

Last day of our first quarter, and her friends had invited me to hang out at the mall with them.

I was excited because me and best friend were finally hanging out out of school.

Before we left school, a friend rushes to me telling me that another friend (Teso) and her friends were going to watch Black Panther 2 in the cinema at the same mall.

I went crazy, ""BLACK PANTHER 2 IS OUT???""

I didn't know it was out already, so you could imagine my excitement.

I head over to Teso, and ask if I could join them for the movie. She agreed , started talking, confesses that she was actually planning to invite me the day before when we called to game, but couldn't because I had finished my internet, and the call never happened.

School finishes at 10, movie starts at 12, mom was due to pick me up at 3.

I haven't forgotten about best friend, but I wanted to see the movie so bad as it was my only chance to see it in cinema, so I devised a plan: hang out with best friend till 12pm, then join Teso and her friends for the movie.

It didn't work. Had to ride in the car with T because best friend's car was full. I arrive the at the mall, but best friend just rode because of complications with Uber.

By the time she gets there and finds me, it's already 11:45. Hang out for 10, then I leave for movie.

I had a great time, movie was great, friends were great. We had fun to say the least, and I was happier than I have been in quite a while.

Guilt starts kicking in when T jokingly says something along the lines of, ""Lol you literally ditched your best friend"".

Been feeling guilty since then, thought it was okay because she seemed to understand.

I DID ditch her for a movie though, I know the original plan was to hang out together since we've never done so before. I'm afraid she'd think I chose a marvel movie over her.

Haven't replied to any of best friend's texts since that day (17/11) because of the guilt, I feel like I should say something about what happened.

I started to have feelings for him but I haven't told him because of Z. I kept it a secret for a long time.

He broke up with Z the next day. From now on he told me he loves me every day. He asked me out 8 days later and I said yes. But the next day he told me he's not ready to get back into a relationship. He needs to heal his mind. He needs to heal that he can give me the love I needed and that we can be stronger together than we could be now. I was sad but I told him he can have all the time he needs to heal. 
We are on call for 48 hours without a break, he's telling me that he wants to marry me and spend the rest of his life with me. He is telling me every day that I am everything he wants and that he loves me. 
But he needs time. He's saying he's doing this for us,  that he's able to give me the love I deserve. This all happened in September, now its almost December. 
A few days ago I started to cry on call and told him i don't believe that we will be together. He said its hurting him to hear that because he's giving his best to heal that he can give me the love I deserve. 
i'm not worth it. I am afraid that I am not able to give him what he needs to heal. I don't know if I can wait longer. I still wanna give him time, but I feel like I'm starting to break.

today she had a football game, it was a tough match and she was getting a lot of shit from the parents i’m the opposing team. my dad taught her a trick my older brother jack used, basically you pick up the ball pretend your about to throw it and when it gets to the end of your hands you move your arms inwards so the ball rolls down your arms, it basically just leaves people looking like idiots trying to protect their faces when nothing is coming at them. 

the ball went into the goal (isabella is a goalie) and a mum from the other team was telling her she’s a shit goalie and ‘it’s good the other team get a shite team for once’ i looked over at the mum and she looked at me with a disgusted look, she clearly thought i was isabella’s mum. i gave  isabella a nod and she went over to the mum and done the trick and the whole of the two teams are watching by this point, when the mum realised the ball wasn’t coming towards her and was still in my sisters hands she immediately lost it, it was even more funny cause all the kids in isabella’s team was dying with laughter and even some of the kids in the other team. the mum stormed over to me and told me to ‘apologise for what my daughter done’ i told the woman that isabella isn’t my daughter and that she’s my little sister she told me that my mum is ‘a bad mother who clearly raised shit kids’ and i just laughed. i told her that she was insulting a 13 year old and said she needs to get a life. 

the referee took isabella aside and said he couldn’t do anything cause she didn’t throw the ball but she shouldn’t do it again, the mum was obviously so angry and demanding that her daughter and her should get special treatment because the mum was threatened. the referee asked the mum to leave because isabella told him what she (the mum) had been saying to her. the mum stormed out and said i was a ‘fugly slag’ and an ‘asshole’ and she went to go get some sort of alcohol from her car. i told her the wine wont suppress her being a mum that clearly has a kid who want to be with her dad, i hadn’t realised the woman was actually divorced and the kids dad who wanted to see her was the other side of the pitch.

the woman stared at me and just left telling her kid that her dad is going to take her home, she was even more upset when the kid looked so happy to be seeing her dad.

As my friend, she comes to me to share her troubles and sometimes ask for advice e.g what would I do if I were her? 

This has intensified over the last 2 weeks or so with my friend coming to me with the following allegations:
- various junior colleagues not liking her and are trying to sabotage her
- various senior managers overlooking her for team leader opportunities even though she is the best
- her bf is being an AH because he wants her to work less (she currently works 2 jobs that takes up to 18 hours a day) and spend more time with him. 

As a friend, I hear her out, agree with her in  some instances, and disagree with her in other instances. 

Yesterday (Saturday), she posted in a picture of the courtyard of her apartment complex (public space) with children's chalk drawing in a group chat. This was followed by her complaining about the drawing, the children who made the drawing and their parents. Her comments included how disgusting chalk drawing (of a semi stick figure person) is, and how irresponsible it is of the children and later their parents for not to clean it up afterwards. 

When I saw the photo of the drawings, I took note that it look like they were done by children not older than 8 y.o. When she started criticising everything I asked her why does it matter so much to her. 

In response she said the kids draw in the courtyard like every weekend, and allegedly owners corporations warned them about it previously. 

I then clarified my point with:
- she is not selling any apartments so any impact of chalk drawing on property value really doesn't impact her
- she rents so she isn't on the owners corporations and wouldn't know what is said or not said
- the drawing is in chalk, it will easily wash away in the rain or with water, and no 5-8 year olds is running around with a bucket of water while playing with friends in case they end up doing chalk drawings. 
- the parents may not be watching the children with a bucket of water prepared either. 

My friend is now demanding an apology, and I don't think she is being reasonable in her comments about the chalk drawings, the children who drew the pictures or the parents.

Skip forward after a month we decided to work this out. He was the one that suggested it. And he wanted me to move back in with him. Let me clarify, I never went to any other guys house, I didn't entertain anyone else praying for this guy to man up and work out this relationship with me. I stayed home most the time and worked, I did go see some old elementary friends to get out of the house (all female). 

So just a few hours ago I decided to go through his phone and he claimed she was just a bridge to burn and how he didn't wanna hurt her feelings when he was doing things with me and wanting to work things out. He deleted almost everything.  But I looked at his cash app and found that they were sending each other money with hearts, he still had her snapcode, and books on crystal healing which he always told me was dumb along with witchcraft. I don't know what came over me but I grabbed him by the arm when he was sleeping and yanked him up. He told me that what he did with her wasn't any of my business because we werent together at the tike and how horrible I was for waking him up because he has work in a few hours. He even told me that he was gonna cancel my Christmas gifts and that I should go stay with my dad for a few days.

And it hurts that he knew I was pregnant, but only put a baby in me because he thought that would make his love for me come back. He told me when I confronted him about her after he had me in his bed, that they didn't do anything. And tonight it's just ""what i did with her when we weren't together is none of your business.""

We get along really well despite our differences. 

We've never managed to go out together in those 3 years because of her living far away.

Last day of our first quarter, and her friends had invited me to hang out at the mall with them.

I was excited because me and bsf were finally hanging out out of school.

Before we left school, a friend rushes to me telling me that another friend (T) and her friends were going to watch Black Panther 2 in the cinema at the same mall.

I went crazy, ""BLACK PANTHER 2 IS OUT???""

I didn't know it was out already, so you could imagine my excitement.

I head over to T, and ask if I could join them for the movie. She agreed , started talking, confesses that she was actually planning to invite me the day before when we called to game, but couldn't because I had finished my internet, and the call never happened.

School finishes at 10, movie starts at 12, mom was due to pick me up at 3.

I haven't forgotten about bsf, but I wanted to see the movie so bad as it was my only chance to see it in cinema, so I devised a plan: hang out with bsf till 12pm, then join T and her friends for the movie.

It didn't work. Had to ride in the car with T because bsf's car was full. I arrive the at the mall, but bsf just rode because of complications with Uber.

By the time she gets there and finds me, it's already 11:45. Hang out for 10, then I leave for movie.

I had a great time, movie was great, friends were great. We had fun to say the least, and I was happier than I have been in quite a while.

Guilt starts kicking in when T jokingly says something along the lines of, ""Lol you literally ditched bsf"".

Been feeling guilty since then,  thought it was okay because bsf seemed to understand. 

I DID ditch her for a movie though, I know the original plan was to hang out together since we've never done so before.  I'm afraid she'd think I chose a marvel movie over her.

This morning, 1 hr before we wanted to leave I told her that she should pack her things so she won't be stressed.
From the on her mood got worse and worse, as did mine.
She told me she didn't have the social or phisical power today to go. I tried to convince her fir a bit, as I always have to do. Normally she jumps over her shadow and has a great time, but not today.
My GF told me to go as I was exited to go there, and she would just stay home. But i was just looking forward spending the day with her, no matter what we do or don't.
Then she said sure was good at making her a bad consciousness, and she got quiet. I can't read her anymore and she got more quiet than usual. She is now taking a shower because she couldn't get a clear thought anymore.
(it's not like we are around each other all the time.) 
Some time ago she told me I was her first BF that actually cared for her and respected her, and she has a constant fear she's not a good GF and that I'd break up, but I never had the thought to do so.

So they just laughed, but my dad after uncle left said that he won’t talk to me and I just said “mhm” cause god I was so into sleeping.

all this combined, has resulted in me texting and seeing my boyfriend a lot less, despite seeing him for 3 days in a row before and on the day of my mum being transferred to the ward. 

i tried my best to be patient and loving with his needs while dealing with this. my family isn’t rich so this surgery has caused us to almost go into debt and he’s been pretty condescending about how it’s stupid for us to not expect an extremely high priced bill for a surgery at a private hospital. i,again, tried to be patient and explain the situation to him. 

he’s also said things like “it’s not like we’re ever meeting” which i can understand his frustration for not seeing me for over a week. i think he feels like since i’m also on a school semester break, that means i’m free to see him whenever. i also let him know that i was upset at him for never once asking me if i’m okay and if i needed anything after knowing my mum practically died (and was resuscitated) and is in the hospital. he was just more upset at the fact that i’ve not been replying often.

 i just feel like he’s being selfish but i think, in his perspective, the fact that i’m supposedly not tied down by school and other responsibilities means he should get more of me even more often. so honestly am i the asshole here for not giving him as much attention as he needs?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4808435,public,top,self,AITA for not giving my boyfriend much attention while my mum’s in the hospital?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z01bdb/aita_for_not_giving_my_boyfriend_much_attention/,all_ads,6,,,

It started out with us talking about basic survival skills. She starts talking about how if she ever got stranded she wouldn’t even try to survive because she believes she has absolutely 0 survival skills. She told me she would let the animals on the island eat her body. She was just overall being very nihilistic. I started to get a little concerned because I used to think this way when I was in the height of my depression and I know she‘s starting to follow that same pattern, so I tried to convince her that she did have survival skills. (Especially since she is in Girl Scouts)

&amp;#x200B;

She didn’t want to believe me and kept saying it was better to die than try to survive and just die a couple days later. At this point I changed the hypothetical to an animal that would 100% die early, and ask her if she would kill it now because it’s going to die anyways. She said she’d try to give it the best life and let nature run its course. I then followed up with a “why would you treat this animal better than yourself“. She had no answer and I went back to the island hypothetical. She still didn’t get the point I was trying to make, which was more about her having hope and at least trying to survive than just give up.

&amp;#x200B;

I changed the hypothetical again to her not trying at all and dying 2 days before she was rescued or trying a little bit and being saved. I asked her which of those options would she choose. She instead focused on how she wouldn’t know someone would save her so she wouldn’t try. She still wasn't getting my point, but it was important to me that she understood how much trying to see the good during hard times was crucial to her mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn’t know how else to get her to understand at that point and brought up our aunt who died from cancer almost a year ago. I told her how my aunt had the choice to just die or get a surgery for the potential to live even though it was a 30% chance she wouldn’t make it off the table. Then I talked about how she took the surgery, and it gave her about 2 more months before she still died. I closed with how those 2 months gave her a lot and trying is better than nothing. After I finished talking, I heard her crying and started to cry myself. She ended up crying herself to sleep and now I'm wondering if I went too far. I’ve been so afraid of her falling down the same path of depression and self-loathing but what if I’m just helping push her further down.

I'm panicking so I just yell ""Omg are you okay? Should I call an ambulance?""

And she freaks out and starts rolling over yelling that she doesn't have health insurance.

Mind you, this woman is full on bleeding from her face and head. Her eyes are wandering and she can' even focus looking at me.

So I just asked her again, ""I'm calling the ambulance okay?""

And she pleads something under her breath that sounded like no but then she just goes quiet.

I freaked the hell out so I just called anyways. They came, I stuck around for a bit.

They loaded her into the ambulance and that was that. She was trying to say something to the paramedics but they didn't listen.

Currently I'm in a group project for 5 more weeks. Its a groop of 5 and two of my group mates is my GF (21F) closest friends. The groups where selected at random. 

The 4 other group members have an other way of working than I have. Discuss everything for hours. Everyone needs to be part of everyone. Dividing up work is not preferred. I may be a little biased but I think there work methodology sucks. We get things done but just half as much in twice the amount of time. I don't learn anything this way, the discussions are in my opinion empty and unnecessary.

I on the other hand, like to just do, try, and redo if it fails. Learn from your mistakes. People can do what they are good at or what they like to optimise time. All of the other projects I have done have used this methodology. I think it's really good and I learn alot from it. 

Yesterday, my GF had l dinner and wine night with her friends. Even though she know that I have complained to her 100 times before she asked how the project was going. I wasn't there but I know that her friends thought that I was annoying and that I always wanted things my way and I talk to much. It all ended up with my GF apologising for me to them. 

Of course I want things my way. And of course I talk much. I give suggestions because no-one else do. And I never get to do it ""my way"" ether because I always get voted down. 

When I picked my GF up from the party I could hardly breathe before she started talking about how I treated her friends in the project. It felt almost like she scolded me but she ensures me that's not what she was doing. She asked if I could lay low and just follow along for the rest fo the project. She dosnt want her friends to hate me and are concerned that the dislike for me may rub off as a dislike for her as well. She doesn't make friends that easily. 

This is where I may be the asshole. I told her that I don't want to jeopardise my education just to keep her friends happy. I think this is a fun course and I can't just sit back, do almost nothing, and just trust that her friends will finish in time. I said that in that case I should just drop the class if I can't do anything. I know it is 1 to 4 in work ethics but that doesn't mean that I can't input my opinions. I also told her that it was wrong of her to apologise for me. I am not sorry. I don't feel like I did anything wrong in the project. 

Obviously she got mad because she feels like I'm destroying her relationship with her friends but it is my education that's on the line. 

I am both mad at her and my group and my GF isn't talking to be. It hasn't been that long but still. I wonder if I was out of line and I should do like my GF said.

Like something heavy is sitting on my chest and I can’t breath.

For example, every night before I sleep I must tap my bed and blanket around 48 times before I can go to sleep. If I wake up at night and go to the bathroom, I must tap my bed and blanket again before I sleep. I also have to tell everyone to tap their beds, even if they’re sleeping or won’t do it, I just have to say it out loud (doesn’t matter if I’m heard or not). The TV must face me directly even if it’s not on, the curtains must cover the Windows completely. I also can’t hear anyone breath or I won’t sleep

I must turn off any switch if the electricity isn’t being used. 

Shoes cant be upside down, they can be sitting in a messy manner but not upside down.

Bed sheets must be pulled very straight without any weird creases.

Pillows must be put in a specific way.

If someone pulls my hair, the other side must also be pulled within the same intensity.

If something falls, I’ll keep dropping it until it falls “right”

It’s weird lol, idk why but these are things I started doing when I was around 15 and get major anxiety if I don’t do them. Nothing bad would happen if I didn’t do them, but it’s just wrong and makes me anxious.

Anyway, last week my brother (20M, let’s call him Mathew) came back after travelling for the past two years so we held a ‘welcome back’ party.

I don’t like parties in general but I was glad Mathew was back.

The party was held in a family friend’s house so I wasn’t familiar with the place.

I was walking around when I noticed a bunch of switches.

I always turn of unused switches, even if I have to get up in the middle of class.

I went to check on them.

They were all inside the kitchen so I assumed they were for the kitchen. All the cooking was done outside so I turned off all of them at once. Everything went out.

The lights outside and inside the house.

I tried to turn them on one by one but the light wouldn’t come back.

The owners of the house came inside and said the lights don’t work unless all are turned on (so, some bedrooms will have the lights on even when empty).

The kitchen isn’t used and so are those bedrooms but they must have the light on so that we get the light outside back.

This triggered me so I just decided to leave instead of argue over their questionable home design.

I was feeling uneasy with all of them having to be on so I said okay, told my brother I was glad to have him back and just left.

I didn’t do it to spite anyone but I probably would’ve passed out from how heavy my chest felt. 

I stayed up all night until my brother came home and had a drink with him to end the night. Mathew didn’t mind me having to leave but everyone else in my family (including friends) are mad at me for being entitled.

We met the beginning of the School year and instantly hit it off. 

I'm bisexual, right? He's never had any problems with it, we talk about some cute girls at our school, talk about female celebrities... normal harmless stuff.

The thing is, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or one of them goes to hug me, (keep in mind they're ALL straight) he gets... really possessive and shoves them off me.

 Another thing, I say 'ily' to my friends, and hug them, and I say 'omg my wife' but **platonically,** because obviously I don't have any sexual/romantic attraction to them, and even if I did it wouldn't be reciprocated? But when this does happen, he gets all like ""no ur mine"" and ""they can't take you from me"" blah blah blah, and everytime I mention that they're pretty (like, they looked good in an outfit that day, or their hair was nice or sum) he says ""OH MY GOD"" in like this really loud / exasperated voice and it pisses me off.   


Like, if he had any faith in me/our relationship, he would know that I wouldn't leave him for them + my feelings for my friends are purely platonic? Like just because I'm bisexual doesn't automatically mean I'm going to hook up with any girl I see.  
He brought it up again after one of our clubs last week, and I got so pissed that I started giving him like really clipped responses, and left early (so maybe im the asshole here)

 We were abit of troublemakers that time, it was 6th grade and i already was straight up being friends with him from the start of the school year. 

From my perspective he acts gay , well he is gay. 
He was nice, fun , and funny to talked to. Not untill he was touching my private part (breast) . I didn't mind it that time because i was young. And i thought it was just a gay thing. Time fly's he started to have a crush on me. He confessed to me. And i rejected him, because i didn't felt the same way. After that he started to become toxic. He tells my friends to no longer being friends with me. And they followed. 

When time pass he started to do &amp; say things like, if i dont agree on things or do what he said. He will unfriend me, and tell my other friends to unfriend me again. As a 6th grader me i was scared of being alone and no longer have any friends. 

Time pass, now on to the present, and now his my (ex) friend. I ignored him in the beginning of school year. 
Its not just because he was toxic nor forceful its because he started to spread things about me. Which it wasn't true. And strangers were looking at me.. 

When i ignored him, he was acting sad and he kept saying hi everytime we see eachother on the school building or flag ceremony. 

A day later , my friends asked if i knew this guy *insert my exfriend name* i said no. When i said that he was behind them. His face looked sad, he went off. My friends stared and was curious and i changed the topic, 
A few days later he left me a message. Sayin i wont be longer being friends with him and the usual thing he said like before in elementary. But he says i wont be friends with him forever. Because i ignored him.

It started out with us talking about basic survival skills. She starts talking about how if she ever got stranded she wouldn’t even try to survive because she believes she has absolutely 0 survival skills. She told me she would let the animals on the island eat her body. She was just overall being very nihilistic. I started to get a little concerned because I used to think this way when I was in the height of my depression and I know she‘s starting to follow that same pattern, so I tried to convince her that she did have survival skills. (Especially since she is in Girl Scouts) She didn’t want to believe me and kept saying it was better to die than try to survive and just die a couple days later. At this point I changed the hypothetical to an animal that would 100% die early, and ask her if she would kill it now because it’s going to die anyways. She said she’d try to give it the best life and let nature run its course. I then followed up with a “why would you treat this animal better than yourself“. She had no answer and I went back to the island hypothetical. She still didn’t get the point I was trying to make, which was more about her having hope and at least trying to survive than just give up. I changed the hypothetical again to her not trying at all and dying 2 days before she was rescued or trying a little bit and being saved. I asked her which of those options would she choose. She instead focused on how she wouldn’t know someone would save her so she wouldn’t try. She still wasn't getting my point, but it was important to me that she understood how much trying to see the good during hard times was crucial to her mental health. I didn’t know how else to get her to understand at that point and brought up our aunt who died from cancer almost a year ago. I told her how my aunt had the choice to just die or get a surgery for the potential to live even though it was a 30% chance she wouldn’t make it off the table. Then I talked about how she took the surgery, and it gave her about 2 more months before she still died. I closed with how those 2 months gave her a lot and trying is better than nothing. After I finished talking, I heard her crying and started to cry myself. She ended up crying herself to sleep and now I'm wondering if I went too far.

So me (26 M) and my girlfriend (24 F) have been together long enough now that the family is asking when we’re going to start thinking about kids. We’re probably a few years off yet because we want to be a bit more secure financially and get married first, but we’ve talked about it a lot and how we want to raise our kids. 

My mum (56) is the oldest of our parents and she is also in the worst health, and is just genuinely eager to be a grandparent, so while she brings it up the most, we don’t mind too much. The biggest problems are my Stepmum (52) and Sister-in-Law (34). 

Both are really opinionated people at the best of times, and yesterday at a family meal the topic of kids came up and we somehow got onto the topic of discipline. Which is when my Stepmum dropped the bombshell that not only does she think hitting your kids is perfectly fine, but that I will do it. 

Now I don’t know where she’s got this idea from, because as a kid who was pretty regularly beat by my mum, I am thoroughly against it. I never want my kids to fear me or dread coming home because there’ll be a belt waiting for them.

She goes onto say about how it’s the only thing that works sometimes and that it didn’t do her or my stepbrother any harm, which is a lie because everyone around that dinner table has been to or needs therapy, and getting hit as a kid probably didn’t help. 

Now I work in education, so dealing with behaviour (I am a behaviour lead in my school as well as a teacher) without hitting kids is probably 40% of my job. My girlfriend also works in education. So I think we can keep our cool and manage not to hit our kids out of frustration, so why would we choose to do it? 

I told her under no circumstances would I hit my child. I explained that I would reason with them why their behaviour wasn’t acceptable and follow that up another tactic such as removing privileges if that didn’t work. When my SiL asked what if they were too young to understand reason, I pointed out that in that case they were probably too young to understand why you’re hitting them. 

Then things got a little messy. My Stepmum did the ‘under my roof, my rules’ spiel, implying she would hit my kids if they misbehaved, which really got my back up. So I said ‘Anyone who I trust to look after my kids hurts them, I’ll do the same thing to them, 10x harder’ which didn’t go down well. 

When she responded that she wouldn’t look after them then, I said that was fine, it’ll just add more grandchildren to the list of ones she isn’t allowed to see which was a bit harsh (but I think justified) considering my brother’s ex won’t let her see their daughter. At that point my dad changed the topic of conversation, but it left a bit of a cloud over the evening.

My husband and I are people of faith (we are of two different religions) but neither  of us are part of this faith. So it would be like sending a Jewish and Buddhist person’s kid to a Mormon college. This faith would teach our children things are right/wrong that we actively disagree with. Oddly enough my FIL is not a part of this faith either, but his wife is and is big on imposing it on others. I have no desire to impose religion on my children and wish for them to choose on their own based on what resonates like I did. Nothing at all resonating is fine by me as well. 

And even though we don’t have kids yet, when we do have them I don’t want them to think their access to a college education hinges on them being religious. It feels wrong. I don’t have a problem with them choosing to go to a religious affiliated school on their own, but not on the grounds of “this is what will be paid for.”

So I basically snapped at my FIL that that wasn’t happening and I’m not sending my children to school to be brainwashed. FIL was very offended and left. Now my brothers and sisters in law are texting saying I’m an AH. I might have a blind spot here but I think even suggesting this was insane. And I’m tired of their  religious imposition.

I really didn't expect us to fight, we were getting along so well. But when reading this, assume I was somehow much brattier than I'm portraying myself, because maybe I was in the wrong, I'm not the best at social interactions and reading things between the lines.

Anyway, here's how it went:

My dad invites me to go out into the city for McDonalds (mom is not talking to us for like 2 weeks already, so we sort of wanted to get out of the house anyway). We go. Everything is fine and dandy. 

But then, as we're nearing McDonalds, I propose that maybe we shouldn't eat there cause it's kinda expensive anyway, maybe we should go to the market and buy produce and all kinds of other things. He says he doesn't like this trait of mine, I'm just like my mother in this sense, that I always try to change things and am so indecisive.

To that I respond that I'm not indecisive, I'm just innovating, proposing new ideas. Anyway, I then say ""would you mind if I didn't eat? Like, I want you to eat at McDonalds, but I'm not hungry anyway, and then we'll go to the market together"". 

And this is where the fight starts. He gets upset and says that we should just go home. Screw it, ""I just wanted to eat a nice meal with you, and you ruined it, you always do this"". And then we went home without eating or going to the market, the whole trip was stopped right then and there. We went home upset.

He also said that I always do this, I always say no, I was like this since I was a kid. I didn't want swimming lessons, I didn't want guitar lessons, I always say no, I never listen. I never listen to anything he says, that was a big point of his.

Anyway, I'm 27. I didn't want to have a big fight, so I asked him not to talk anymore and I just said I'm leaving home in a few days. I'm done, I'm tired of this kind of behavior.

Am I in the wrong? Was I being really bratty without seeing it? Is it such a big offense to change plans last minute? I mean, it was sort of an impromptu thing anyway, it's not like we planned this for weeks or anything.

P.S: Please assume that I am heavily biased and that I was somehow a lot meaner, be objective please. Thank you.

While he did his fishing and such, i lazed around and tanned with him joining me after about an hour. 

While tanning my back, he placed his hand on my bum and jokingly left it there. I started joking about how a hand print tan line would be ugly and I tan really quickly so he should take his hand off. He insisted on keeping it there and we went back and forth, me still laughing and joking about it while pushing his hand off of me. 

His tone started to shift and he told me I was actually making him upset. I responded that that’s unreasonable, I just don’t want a handprint on my ass. He then accused me of cheating/seeing other men with the defence of “who else is going to look at your ass, is it other guys” which confused and upset me, he said it was the only plausible reason.

I told him he should go and I’ll find my way home on my own as the stunt he had just pulled was unacceptable, but he stayed anyways.

I lost it, I told him that his behaviour is immature and toxic, and I won’t put up with it, as well as other things about how he consistently makes me feel bad about situations in which I’ve done nothing wrong, people were walking by me losing my shit and crying and he got embarrassed and asked me to “yell at him in the car.” Following some more time of me calming down, I marched to the car and let him drive me home in silence. He did not attempt to apologise or respond to any of the things I’d said.

I’m usually a very mature and collected person, when things upset me I take time to process them and bring them up at the right time. But this just pushed me over the edge. 

Some context, I have never cheated and do not have the intention of ever doing it. I’ve never been sneaky or hid things from him. I’m kind of a hermit, so my lifestyle is not exactly one that aligns with opportunities for it either so I don’t know where his suspicions come from. I’m also very open about what I do who I do it with where I am etc etc. This isn’t the first time he’s accused me of it, and I’ve told him that it’s hurtful and irrational, I understand that maybe he has insecurities, but they should not be projected onto me to this extent.

She’s always been very kind to me, she’s smart and clever, driven and determined to a fault, and also the most beautiful girl I could ever dream of. She goes to a college about 2 hours away so we’ve been running a semi LDR for a while now, seeing each other only on weekends (though I may join her up there in the spring). Whenever we do get together, I’m generally the one who plans the date. Not because I want control, but she just doesn’t usually have much input. She just kinda lets it be my thing, and when she does know what she wants, we almost always do that. She also NEVER wears makeup except on very special occasions a while back(school dances, senior photos, standard senior year stuff). Here’s about where we get back to the original topic, a lot of our dates are pretty casual, sometimes we go a bit more upscale, but I always try to put some effort into my appearance; Nice shirt, freshly showered and shaved, hair styled, etc.. (She didn’t even know I owned any graphic tees until after a few months of dating!) The issue is that it almost always feels like she’s putting very little effort in. For ages I didn’t mind, I still don’t think she “needs makeup”, but now we’ve started going to nicer places together and she still rarely does anything to prepare for it. Now, I know that guys getting ready vs girls getting ready is VERY different, and girls have a LOT more expected of them that they probably shouldn’t have to and it’s pretty unfair, but it often just feels like she doesn’t care. She doesn’t usually do her hair other than stick it in a braid, she wears graphic tees that are slightly too big for her because she dislikes female cuts, and obviously doesn’t wear any makeup. I don’t really want her wearing heavy makeup, but just a little maybe around the eyes or simply dropping the makeup aspect altogether and just wearing something nice (Though, on a personal level that I’m trying not to let affect this, she looks really hot when she’s wearing a little bit of eye makeup 😅). As I think I already stated, I really don’t care about any of this for when we’re just around the house or something super casual, a good majority of the time this isn’t an issue in my mind. It’s just when we’re going out on a date, particularly the nicer ones. Also just want to reiterate that I don’t think she “needs makeup”, it’s just almost like a courtesy thing in my mind to show a bit of effort and as a bit of a traditionally minded person, idk, it just seems like the appropriate thing for a date. I haven’t talked to her about any of this yet, so I guess this is a bit of a two-parter: AITA for wanting this? And if not, how do I address this with her without being shallow?

I'll start by mentioning that I'm nowhere fit myself and rather I'm overweight. I do know that It took a significant strain on my mental health, and on top of that, I don't like the way I look. I'm not morbidly obese, but I have far from the perfect body and haven't put any real effort into it lately.

When I met my GF, she was fit, maybe too skinny, but I never mentioned anything. In the last couple of months, she has started complaining about how her clothes don't fit. She doesn't live by far any active lifestyle (like me, though), and she likes the food. It seems that she doesn't see that it's not entirely healthy to eat everything in sight when stoned. When I try to stop her or mention something, she says, ""you don't love me?"" - ""you don't want me to enjoy the food?"" - ""do you want to say I'm fat and ugly?"" And so on...

When it comes to intake of calories, she doesn't want to constrain herself, and I think that is fine -- yet I know it will get harder to lose this extra weight. I feel like a hypocrite, for a good reason, and on top of that, I love her; I love how she looks, but I can't bring myself to stop thinking that if she continues this path, she will feel gain just a bit too much. I'm not really into big girls, and I'd hate to see this situation escalate, yet as I said, I do love her, big or not. She is just the loveliest person whom can see past my imperfections.

According to him i have been the reason he stopped watching porn after being addicted to it for year which made me happy(i tell him that its okay if he wants to watch it sometimes just not to over do it but he refuses). Being addicted for years tho has gave him knowledge on a lot of pornstars( he knows many of their names) but it didn't bother because again he got over his addiction. Also when he watches a show or anime, even if he really likes it, he will forget the name of the show and its caracters(this will be important later). 

So today we were talking on the phone and he was horny and so was I, so were flirting with each other and he was telling me what he was gonna do to me(he wants to try butt stuff). I sent him a picture of a butt plug and I asked him to buy it for me(I've never put a butt plug before) and the first thing he said was "" the only girl I thought the butt plug suited her was (something) James"" (I forgot the name). 

I, of course, was taken back since I didn't expect this as a response and this is where I might have been the asshole. 

I told him that of course he remembers her name like all the other pornstars(he used to name a few back when he still watched porn) but can't even remember the name of shows or animes he loves or the caracters in them and this shows what truly still interests him. 

I had to leave the call but he texted me saying that this was just old knowledge and that he hates himself for his past addiction and never wants to go back to it. I said then why did you bring her up in the first place and he replied that he just wants to figure out where to buy one since they don't sell sex toys in our country and he remembered her because she showed a butt plug in an ad.We argued a little more then it ended there. 

I feel like i should apologize because i feel really bad for bringing up something like that and i think i was quick to judge him when he only was just thinking about how to buy one for me but I'm not sure, so AITA?
