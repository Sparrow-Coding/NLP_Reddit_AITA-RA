The cat’s owner had to give my family their cat for what was supposed to be a month since they could no longer afford to stay in their apartment. Four months went by without the owner contacting us. The cat is extremely happy with us, lots of space, there’s always someone home, and the cat has made a strong bond with my family and vice versa. 

The owner recently asked to take the cat back, the honorable thing to do is of course to give it back which is what we plan to do despite how painful it’s going to be. I’ve made peace with the fact that I won’t have the cat around to enjoy and take care of. What I still struggle with though is the thought of the cat being terrified and wondering where my family and I are while it adjusts to its new living situation. I also fear that with the original owner, the cat would have to move from place to place each year as apartment leases are fucked in my city and they do not have the highest income.

Half of me thinks I shouldn’t steal this person’s cat, half of me thinks I would be protecting the cat from suffering by keeping it.

My (17m) brother (26m) was being arrogant and rude when I asked him to do a simple favour. I asked my brother to order me a $10 uber due to me not being able to order an uber on my phone. I clearly stated that I would transfer him the exact money, however, he refused. I asked him three times in a polite manner, however, he rudely said “no”. I concluded that it was an obvious no from my brother and me constantly asking him would accomplish nothing. My brother made the argument that he would not order the uber due to me and my friend (16f and pregnant) were going to pick up marijuana and use it throughout the day. I use marijuana to self-medicate several intellectual disorders; however, I’m planning to get medicinal cannabis so I can legally consume it. Whilst closing the door, I slammed it too hard which resulted in a tiny crack and my brother made it out way worse than it seemed and I clearly stated, “I’m sorry”, however, he played your crazy card on me. I did say “it’s not my fault your door is weak” which while initially perceived as bad, it was due to me having anxiety at the heat of thew moment because I was stressing over the uber. Furthermore, I did say, “I will spit in your room if you do it again”, and whilst it was obviously wrong for me to say, it was in the heat of the moment, and I apologised. My brother told my parents and now everyone is having a go at me, saying I’m a “bad person”.

We met up at the Spencer's there and everything was going pretty well. Given that the winters here are cold, I was wearing a jacket. When I got into the store, it was *really* hot (no other store was this hot, it was basically boiling). Note, I don't really like Spencer's products and never show much interest in them let alone touch anything. I understand that a group of teenagers is every customer service employee's nightmare, and I definitely understand as to why.

My friends and I aren't the type of people to steal. At all. Obviously, this isn't really shown when you're shopping because everyone is a stranger. So, I was getting really hot in the boiling Spencer's and took my mini backpack off (that was already partially filled with some stuff like a water bottle and meds) and was getting to work at putting my also small puffer jacket into it. It ended up fitting after like 3 minutes of struggle, but everything was good. Though, I was constantly hounded and followed every minute that I struggled by this lady employee asking if I needed help finding anything or if everything was good (yk, in *THAT* tone). I found this very weird because I never touched anything and showed interest in anything and this woman knew because she was hot on my trail the entire time we were in the store. I was thinking ""well, yeah, I probably look a little suspicious, but I don't really appreciate getting hounded and profiled because I'm a teen"". Never did anything to her, was perfectly nice or yelled at her in case you thought I was like a mini Karen towards her after she was following me around. My other friend (16M) ended up doing the same thing with his jacket into his BIG backpack and got 0 questions. I also found this really weird since he showed interest into a lot of things and was messing around like a typical teenager. 

After I got home, I told my parents about it and my mom went off on me saying that I'm acting like I know everything and that I'm just a stupid teen who should be sussed because people my age are the ones that tend to steal in places like those. I obviously retorted saying ""I understand she could find me suspicious, but it was stupid that I was being questioned every single minute because of my age"". My mom had argued back saying that I shouldn't have taken my jacket off and put it in my backpack in a store and I should've done it either outside the store or draped it over my arm. Yes, I can acknowledge that I could've draped it over my arm, but I wasn't expecting to be *targeted* for putting my jacket into my backpack because it has never happened and I've been a teen for almost 6 years.

I found out about the relationship when were having drinks as a company after work at our office and out of nowhere she brings my brother in. she was a little drunk at the time but made a point to come over to me and say loudly in front of everyone “omg this must be so weird for you I invited your brother here” and keeps rambling on like that. I ignored it and left not long after.
Fast forward a few weeks and I go visit my parents who my brother is still living with. They tell me about how he’s been sneaking in and out of a her window and comes home covered in hickeys. To make matters worse my colleague lives across the street at her parents and with her 10 year old child.
He was also meant to leave for the army in a few months (something he’s wanted to do since he was 5) but has now decided to stay. My parents were looking forward to him leaving and because my country is in a housing crisis he won’t be moving anytime soon. My parents see the relationship as bit inappropriate and find it weird she’s sneaking him in through her window.

When she tries to talk to me now I just brush her off/ignore her due to the awkwardness of the situation and I kinda see the relationships as a bit inappropriate due to him just getting out of his teens and her having a child. With him no longer joining the army it almost feels like he’s throwing his life away? 
 
At the end of the day it is his life and he can do what he wants with hit but i can’t help but to be concerned.

My sister, let's call her A, has had to come back to my childhood home because she recently got out of a relationship with a man she slept with while in a relationship with her ex-ex-boyfriend(?). 

Because she has a habit of cheating and sleeping around I am rather cautious of her when it comes to my boyfriend. (24) 

Yesterday, my boyfriend came home with a bunch of snacks for us including two bags of cheetos (they were in a bag and were barely noticable). I guess at one point A asked if he had any snacks, and my boyfriend told her we had cheetos. Initially he told her she could get a bowl, but she asked for the whole bag. And he gave it to her. 

When he came back into our room, I asked if he had given them to her, and he said yes. I got upset and I asked why, he said bc she asked and he was just being nice. We got into an argument.

I already told him that I was sorry, and we're on good terms now. But I can't help but feel uncomfortable by the whole interaction.

I still maintain as close contact as I can with my mom (74) but I only visit very rarely and due to her age she's not making the hike out here more than maybe once a  year.

My  father (75) wasn't supposed to live to see me graduate high  school. Clearly, he's still around or I wouldn't be writing this. Now  I'm getting more actual updates on his condition and he's getting closer  to the end and while I don't have any interest in reconnecting with him on a personal level, I do want to head things off at the pass before I  visit my mom next (likely March.)

I  finally started T almost 2 years ago after moving 6 hours  from my hometown to get to a state/city with easier access to that care.  The last time I went home, I could still push my voice into a higher  register and my facial hair wasn't really A Thing yet. Now, however, neither is true and I know that even if his eyesight is terrible he's going to clock that I don't sound the same should I run into him.

My  mom has been doing her best balancing my legal name around everyone  else and having to deadname/wrong pronoun me the second dad might be in earshot whenever I call her which is usually once a week. She took a  while to come around but never once asked me to do the legwork of  research for her and once she got herself into it she has been one of my  biggest supporters.

I  want to tell him because I want to ease the burden on her keeping this  massive secret. I have emailed her to let her know that I'm thinking of  doing this and with the distance I'm at I'm in no fear of him losing it  at me or anything like that. I'm beyond the point of caring what he  thinks about my life and have been through quite a lot of therapy to  help me get to a point where I feel safe and loved and am absolutely  thriving with the chosen family I surround myself with.

However,  I worry that he might do his usual three rounds of yelling about  something before he calms down and while I know my mother is more than  strong enough to yell back and handle him (something she wasn't before I  said heck it I'm out without telling him where I was moving the first  time,) I also am struggling with the C-PTSD surging at the thought of  him blowing his top though he's already convinced himself that my going  NC with him was clearly my mother somehow poisoning me against him (his  words,) and not 20+ years of his own actions.

So  tell me, Reddit, WIBTA if I did this so I don't have to make my mom  keep my secret or ever hear my deadname from her lips again when I can  hear how bad she feels about it? I have never once yelled at her for  doing this. I know the situation. She is in no danger from him.

I caught him reading sex scenes in the living room but I wasn’t too concerned even though I thought it was weird. 
          That was until we were at dinner with my grandmother, mother, aunt, and brother. He was sat between myself and my grandmother. We were all eating dinner and talking but he wasn’t. He was only interested in what was on his phone. I didn’t pay any attention to it until I saw “pet play” and “aliens/monsters” out of the corner of my eye. For a moment I thought I was crazy so I looked over and he started getting upset and telling me to fuck off. I looked over again (here’s where I started being and asshole according to him). 
          He was coloring in a graphic with jars that have text under them that were a variety of kinks. I guess it was some sort of kinkiness meter. I was shocked because we were in a public restaurant and he was right next to our grandma. I assumed he was talking about himself and his own kinks and said, “bro seriously! At the dinner table!” I said it quietly enough for my brother (he was across from me) to notice but nobody else. 
          He once again told me to fuck off and continued to do it. A hour or so later everyone is done eating and we head home after dropping off my grandmother and aunt.

I didn’t want to be confrontational I just wanted to “gently” let him know it was an unacceptable thing to do. 
          While I was explaining he kept telling me to shut up. My family was disgusted and he tried to defend himself by saying it was his character’s kinks, not his own. Then he started getting pissed telling me I shouldn’t have looked at his phone and that it was an invasion of his privacy and he shouldn’t be shamed. I told him that it doesn’t matter it could’ve been my grandma looking over at his phone. His privacy doesn’t matter in a public place when he’s doing explicit things on his phone.

My sister and her gf have been poking fun at it. At first laughing at my subscriber numbers and how many people actually watched, and then just laughing.

Over the last few months more people have been watched I joined a larger channel at 5k and over the last few months we’ve grown to 10k. My sister (plus girlfriend) are staying here with my Mom and I. I reminded them on Tuesday and once again last night when the shows were to laughter. Halfway through my pod  People were asking if someone was scratching during the last 30 minutes. It was my family whispering it was getting me too. I finish the pod and say “that was fucking awful can y’all stop talking or go to someone else’s room only 5 minutes till the next pod.” Laughter from my sister and girlfriend. 

I repeat show is about to start go to someone’s room. More laughing. My sister mentions that since I live with my mom I have no right to say what to do. I told her that since I gave her 12k 2 years ago she has no right to tell me anything. Especially since I’ve seen none of it. She then starts to compare me to our yncle, and continues to laugh at me. I hear her girlfriend telling her to stop and to just leave while still poking fun. I yelled downstairs at them that I’m done and leaving and cancelled my podcast because I was in an awful mood and couldn’t fake it for the show. Not to mention they are still laughing and whispering smart comments.

I go downstairs and talk to my mom. She says she doesn’t want to be involved. She understands both sides. I tell her that I don’t understand how she can. They’ve been poking fun at my show for weeks and they don’t take it seriously and ruined a show (and money I make from it) and were comfortable doing it again. She says that she was in shock that the argument came out of such an easily fixed issue. She mentioned how I could have handled it better. I agree I could’ve used better words but I’m mad and upset. I don’t think we should be focusing on my tone instead of the how they treat me and make fun of me.

I come back home and make an immature joke asking her if she’s talked to dumb and dumber yet. And she says don’t bring that back in here (or something to that extent). I respond with funny how you can stand up for people now. She says she’s not defending anyone and another fight has begun. I explain that I feel like no one is listening that I take this show seriously and no one else is. I’m getting laughed at and made fun of yet all we talk about is my tone and creating drama. She says that I don’t know the conversations she’s had with my sister. I agree with her that I don’t but I’ve yet to here her say that she understands where I’m coming from, or that my sister was wrong for that, or even a I’m sorry you had to deal with that.

After the few first hangouts we started to sleepover at each others houses. This wasn’t a problem for my parents or his as he was out as gay. However, the more sleepovers we had, the more obvious advancements he tried to make. Over time I started to feel more uncomfortable as it was becoming more physical. It started off as us making coupley tiktoks for a laugh, but that’s when it all started to change. 

I wasn’t really against the advancements in the beginning as he was gay and we were extremely close. He did do a few things though that I personally found unsettling, wether that was getting up in my personal space constantly or talking about my body in a sexual manner and imo the worst one was he got hard in my presence on purpose multiple times while viewing sexual material. I did try to talk to him at one point but he’s a very stubborn and defensive man so it was difficult to get any point across. 

Throughout this period we were spending a huge amount of time together, wether it was with our mutual friends who we also hung out with, or on our own. It tended to be us alone a lot as we live so near each other. So during the peak of our hang outs he then came out us unlabelled, and suddenly all he could talk about was him being into girls. He even lied about having sex with a girl who we both knew before coming clean realising the issue there. 

Now I really do not want to come off as self centred or anything like that but I couldn’t help thinking that he maybe came out to make moves on me. Obviously I believe him and his sexuality, but this sudden change in sexuality during his multiple times of coming onto me and making me uncomfortable was suspiciously timed. Especially, because in the beginning when I would back away from him slightly he would take what he said back and say he was gay again. So as you can probably see, confusing, to both of us I’m sure.

I know this probably sounds like I am a bad person in not supporting my friends decision. But from my point of view he was out as gay, making me uncomfortable with his advances, and during a sleepover when he was doing that very thing he comes out to me as liking women, while very clearly trying to make moves. 

My problem is not his sexuality but more the way he has gone about it. Instead of waiting for an intimate place of trust he put me in a position where it felt very much like he was trying something on me which I wasn’t comfortable with especially as it was unexpected. However, I didn’t not voice those opinions. 

I spoke to friends of mine and a few of them told me it wasn’t about me and I wasn’t allowed to think/feel like this. Is this true? AITA?


TL;DR- my gay friend was to comfortable in physical actions, then came out as liking women whilst obviously trying to make sexual advances to me.I felt uncomfortable and told my friends but was told I was a bitch.

He told me but not K. We have been friends a little longer, and he was opening up to me and asked me not to talk about it with K.

And then he told me about his family cabin and invited me there for 4th of July. I thought he invited her too so I didn’t mention or think anything of it. Then I talked about that and she got even more pissed.

I don’t wish to be a hindrance to her so of course I encourage this wish of hers, but at the same time it hurts me. I have no wish to stay abroad and I’ll rather have a stable life in the mid-size town where I live. 

So my issue is twofold. On one hand, I have never met anyone as great as her, we get along really well and have a lot of fun when we’re together. On the other hand, we physically cannot have as much sex as I feel I need and want, and she wants to live another type of life than I want to. She wants to live in a bigger town than I want to and she wants to stay abroad more than I want to.

I don’t know how much of a difference I can accept. Sometimes I feel like I’m wasting my time since I’m alone at home while she’s abroad and I’m in my “prime” basically being single but not able to date. At the same time we get really well along. I really don’t know what to do. I love her but I’m not sure it’s going to last in the long run and I’m not sure I want to spend all this time just waiting while she’s abroad instead of living my own life.

My fiancé (M26) invited his family over for thanksgiving. Me and my fiancé always host but usually MY family comes every year, not his. We decided it’d be better if everyone from both sides came and we all celebrated as a family considering we all will be soon. My fiancé is a mamas boy and I had no problem with it until this week. Previously, his mother overstepped boundaries by sleeping in our bed, forcing us to sleep in the guest room. Me and him talked about it and he said he wasn’t going to continue siding with his mom just because he didn’t want to create drama. So anyway, I was gathering up my clothes for a shower and left the room for a towel. She was in my room weirdly enough and when I saw her I asked if she needed something she says “Nope don’t need anything .. especially not from you” which was very off putting as you can imagine. She left the room and I went in our bathroom (attached to room) 
 
 When I left the bathroom and went to grab my satin robe , I noticed that it was gone. I brushed it off thinking maybe it was dirty and I put it in the laundry basket for later. I got dressed and went to my dresser to grab my perfume that was sitting on the top. Gone. The one I always talked about and that I loved so much. I use a different perfume because I have a few. Later that day she asks me to get her a blanket while she’s sitting on the couch. So I go to the guest room to retriever a small throw that was in the closet. When I catch a glimpse of my perfume, sunglasses, makeup, and my robe. I immediately get my fiancé and we both have a talk with her. She’s no longer staying for the weekend (all the rest of our families left except my favorite sister and mom) But i’m starting to feel that maybe I was being dramatic by kicking her out. Maybe she wanted to borrow the stuff..? I’m glad my fiancé stepped up though.

He is always late,like I can’t remember a time when he was on time.At first I told him that I didn’t like it cause while I was waiting him I could do other stuff so if he could please inform me in time.The issue doesn’t stop.Sometimes I let it go, some other times I gentle remind him to please next time warn me of his lateness and some other time I’ll make a joke about it.Oh and I forgot he is always late by half an hour, an hour or more, minimum half an hour. 
Today we were supposed to meet (I’m in my exams period) at 2p.m. And 1h before, while I was already in the bus, he texted me that he just finish work and had to go lunch with his coworkers. I was in the bus eating a sandwich cause I didn’t have time to cook me nothing at home and I couldn’t help but star crying. So I wrote to him angrily that instead of stopping where we had to meet and wait for him for the thousandth time in the cold I was going to visit my doctor because I needed to vent. 
When he finished his lunch started to reply to me pissed off that I had gone too far in leaving, that I could go into a bar and wait for him while I had a drink, that he was very hurt that I had left and that he had asked for tomorrow's day off from work just to be with me. 
That’s the worst part to me. Cause he didn’t even said sorry for the lateness he just went mad cause I didn’t waited for him. This was the first time that I didn’t wait and I didn’t expect him to react in this way. And I didn’t stayed in a bar cause I did it multiple time and I’m a student, I don’t have enough money to stay an hour in a bar every time we see each other. 
And the part where he told me that he ask a day off from work to be with me it’s bull**** cause though out the week he told me that he was gonna do more shift for been free Saturday and go a barbecue with his friends. 
I didn’t like his attempt to shift blame and make me feel guilty. I’m working on guilty and it’s easy for me feeling guilty unnecessarily, and he knows that. I don’t think he did it consciously tho. Like I think he said those thing in the hit of the moment. But still hurts. The coup de grace came when I told him that after the visit with the doctor was over we could meet and talk about it and his response was "" no, I have other things to do. You have already been consoled by your doctor, you don't need to talk to me."" 
Here I may have been the idiot cause I snapped, I texted him to go to hell, that I was asking him for something simple and that if he wasn't always late but only occasionally I wouldn't be this upset.Then I wrote him not to write me again unless it was for a heartfelt apology and I blocked him. I'm not proud of my behavior, I realize it wasn't mature or helpful but it was the straw that broke the camel's back and he only made it worse with his anger and words.

I idolized her as a child, but as I’ve grown older, I’ve come to dislike who she is as a person. For context, we have always lived at least a 10-12 hour drive from each other - so most of our conversations have been via phone. 

It started when she would tell me things about my dad but then add, “Don’t tell him I told you. He wants to tell you himself.” I immediately told her that was a “no-go” for me and she shouldn’t tell me things that my dad didn’t want me to know yet. She also spent all of our phone calls gossiping about my aunts, uncles, cousins, and stepmom.

I tried setting boundaries with her, which she has never respected. I stopped engaging in conversations with her about others and things that were none of my business. During one conversation she became angry, saying that I was the “worst grandchild” after I told her that my cousins would tell me themselves if they wanted me to know they are addicted to heroin, got a DUI, or cheated on their wife. She went on to say I have a horrible personality and that’s why no man has wanted to marry me. 

Two weeks later, my grandpa passed away. She told my cousins not to call me when he was admitted to the hospital three days prior, and I wasn’t able to get there in time to say goodbye before he was removed from life support. I chose to overlook this and the horrible things she said and stayed with her an extra week after his funeral so that she wouldn’t be alone. 

Over the years, her gossip about others only grew worse. She also started saying horribly racist comments in my presence. I imagine she’s always been racist, but I’m just now becoming aware of how racist she is these past several years because she no longer has my grandpa to talk to. She also started saying purposefully hurtful things to me again. 

I tried talking to my dad about some of this, but he simply told me that she’s an elderly widow, and I should bite my tongue when I want to tell her how I feel. 

I decided two years ago that I don’t care to engage with her at all anymore. She doesn’t respect my boundaries, and no loving and supportive grandparent would talk to or about their children/grandchildren the way that she does. My uncle also went NC with her for similar reasons.

A few months ago, my dad told me that she was diagnosed with throat cancer. She’s been going through chemo and has a good prognosis of being in remission soon.

I have not contacted her. She also has not contacted me. I don’t wish her any harm or pain, but I think that reaching out now that she has cancer would only be fake of me. She’s elderly. Any time with her was already limited before she got cancer. If I had no intention of reaching out to her beforehand, then cancer really shouldn’t change anything.

I also just watch videos of animals in my free time, such as wild horses in herds, to learn body language and behaviour as I just love animals and they are my passion in life.

She believes because she loves her pets, and tells them she loves them that makes her a good pet owner.

I only want to feed our pets their food. Food made for them, that is healthy for them and more natural.
My mother is different. She has fed our pets people food her entire life, including small amounts of CHOCOLATE to our dogs. She also NEVER trains our pets, and when I try to she makes me feel awkward and says how ""It's not gonna work, you're not doing anything.""
This also includes no boundaries, animals being pushy with food, my dog would never walk on leash BESIDE me bc my mom never let me train her to.

And she also thinks love is enough for small pets she would just dump into a tiny cage or tank with straw or newspaper for the bedding, no hides and unhealthy food.

My son have RSV, Rhino and Adenovirus. It's been a rough few days and I havent slept much since. So we didn't go anywhere as I don't want to risk my baby getting worse. My SO and I decided it was best he not leave the house, nor should we have guests over. Well this evening his mother wanted to come by as it is sleeting. I said no. My son is sick. She only wanted to come by so she could be closer to her job as she doesn't want to drive in the snow/rain. I still said no, my son is sick. The more my SO pushed that it would only be a few minutes, the meaner I got. I'm sorry but the weather and her living far from her job are not my problem. After a few minutes my MIL started texting that I'm messed up from not allowing her to come. She starts bringing my family into it, things like they can come over whenever and stay as long as they want. Not knowing my family has respected all of my boundaries and also not knowing my family within ourselves are having tons of issues and keep a distance with each other. I asked her to not mention them as she knows nothing. She continues to do so and continues to make me angry. I wanted to rip her a new one but I just told her the conversation needed to end and blocked her. My SO says he understands where I'm coming from but that I was so rude and ugly in my delivery. But I dont think he does understand. He has never defended me. His family talks about me behind our backs. His mother has never respected any of my boundaries and continues to try to do what she wants. But this time. I. Snapped. Im tired of if. My SO and I agured. Now his clothes are all over the floor. He's in the living room and I'm in my room with my son crying as I type this out. I know in my heart I'm not an A.

I've been applying to countless amounts of jobs on LinkedIn that I fit the criteria for in both education and experience and have even been applying to job I'm overqualified for because I need a job to support my family. I've applied so far to about 200 jobs and only received a request to interview for 1. I've had a professional look over my resume and no issue was found. I felt like my search was pointless because I DO want to work I would just get rejected sometimes within 10-24 hours of applying. I have a friend who was also laid off but 6 months prior and she has also been job searching to no avail. I have an Indian first name and an English last name.  I ended up changing my first name on my resume to something super easy and common, something that did not sound ethnic and got contacted to interview at most of the places I applied to. 

I got a job offer at one place that I did accept but I ended up telling HR that I needed to disclose what my legal first name was for tax/pay purposes and I was denied the job after because I ""lied"" in my application process and they were unsure what else I might be lying about. I tried to explain but they told me regardless of the reason I changed my first name that it was uncalled for and it was a lie and they do not want someone like me working for their company. They told me the offer has been rescinded. 

When I told my friend about changing her first name (she is also Indian) to find a job she told me that I am hiding my identity and not being true to myself and my parents would be ashamed. She said she is not going to do this and that I should not stoop to anyone's level just to make them comfortable with my name.

I understand that she’s allowed to be excited about this very fun experience.

This is her second concert in two months I believe, two groups we both love very much. The first concert I was jokingly salty about but still excited to hear the details as I’ve never been to one before. This time stings a little because I was very close to going.

I asked my dad to buy me a ticket (I don’t have a job atm) but then got angry and hasn’t been talking to me or my sister (long story, he’s definitely in the wrong and everyone in the house agrees) so he’s not buying my ticket anymore. For additional info: her friend bought her ticket both times.

My sister has not been sensitive to my feelings on the situation, I bring this up only to clarify her attitude and language so you better understand. She’s not responsible for my feelings. I know it’s childish but I am really bummed. Before she left this morning she’s been gushing a lot about how fun it’s going to be and I just get more sad.

From the last time she went I know she’s gonna talk about it for a few days after she comes back, watch youtube videos of the concert on the tv, etc. I’m home a lot since I go to school online and with covid (and their own jobs/school duties) I haven’t really seen or hung out with my friends in a while, especially outside of my house. I have been pretty down for a while now, and this just kind of made everything worse. And the fact that I was so close to seeing this group I love a lot. I know some people will think it’s stupid and definitely first world problems but it’s how I feel.

She has made it insufferable by continuously making my husband do stuff for her, when he was with me she would make up stupid scenarios like she saw “a ghost” and my husband would look around our yard to see if there was an imaginary “intruder”. I’ve been having a constant cephalalgy.

I have asked my husband if he can make her stay shorter because of how much of an inconvenience she was, he said he will speak to her and make her understand that this isn’t ideal for us.

She became less of a nuisance and stop pulling out funny tricks so she could drag her son away from my presence.

UNTIL the day before yesterday, (it rages me to still think about this), she had my specially curated 3am pregnancy snack that everyone knows is mine. The snack was a homemade ice cream jacket potato (i know, sounds sickening but tastes so good). 

When I woke up from my sleep like I’ve been doing for the last week and a half, I would go to my fridge and have my snack, go freshen up again and sleep for a bit. 

So when I woke up from this sleep to find out that my mother in law has eaten my snack and my fridge was missing my specially curated ice cream jacket potato. I practically went into an abyss of immense frenzy. 

I sat next to the sofa beside the bed my mother in law was sleeping in, i saw the empty bowl on her bedside table, so I sat there for two hours until she woke up. 

She woke up perplexed and i informed her that her stay is going to run short, she was talking about “thanksgiving being tomorrow” and I told her she could come back for a couple of hours on thanksgiving. I helped her pack and called her a taxi whilst my husband woke up at 7am, to find his mother missing.

I informed him of what happened, he said I went overboard and ballistic for something so minuscule. I told him that it was a SPECIALLY CURATED DISH OF MINE THAT TOOK 2 HOURS TO MAKE A DAY. He still called me insane for reacting to such measures.

Thanksgiving was severely awkward but great.

The group is made up of his parents, brother and sister-in-law, my husband, me, and now our toddler. When we go out to eat with his family, it's always at what I consider to be a nice restaurant, but it doesn't even have to be very nice for the meal to be unreasonably expensive for one couple to pay for in my opinion. So when his family pays, I feel like I have to watch what I order and get the cheapest menu items possible out of consideration for them. Also, when it's our turn to pick a restaurant and pay, I feel like I want to match the level of expense when HIS family is being treated by us, to when we are treated by them, so that it's fair, even though it would break the bank for us.

My husband says that we don't have to ""match"" the level of niceness and that even just eating at iHop or something would be fine when it's our turn to pay. He feels strongly that his family's focus is on us all being together, not where we are dining, and that figuring out separate checks or ""keeping tallies"" on where we eat and how much is spent destracts from the close atmosphere.

I do agree that I think his family is very giving and not focusing on these things. But I am. I feel extremely uncomfortable being treated and then not giving as much in return, and to be honest even iHop is expensive if you're paying for a whole family. 

While he feels that it causes separation to pay separately, I feel it causes separation to pay together if there are economic differences. It highlights who the poorer people are for one thing, if you're alternating between Gordon Ramsay restaurants and iHop (sorry iHop lol). I also think that, even if all of us had exactly the same finances, it makes us focus strongly on what we're ordering and not feel free to get what we want.

I feel deeply uncomfortable with this arrangement, especially now that we have a toddler son in the mix. That means they will be paying even MORE for us during these outings! My husband thinks that I have a problem with this arrangement due to a ""scarcity mindset"" from my messed up childhood, but I do not think it's so simple as that. I am considering approaching his family to ask if we can split the bills separately when we visit in a few weeks (the first time with our son). Would this be reasonable, or is my husband right in saying that the way his side of the family operates is normal and I should just let it be? I'm afraid of taking advantage of their kindness and being a cheapskate in return.

My husband also thinks I'm being inconsistent with my logic, because I have admitted that if I were richer than them I would feel fine treating them all the time no problem.

As an aside, this has been an ongoing debate between us since dating. He wanted to always treat me while I wanted to always split checks.

I understand that I am a main pillar of support and I do my best to be supportive where I can. We’ve been together for more than 5 years.

Lately, their episodes have become more serious and have been asking that I leave work early or not go to work completely. This happens every few days but at least once every one or two weeks. 

I’ve left work for them before, on multiple occasions. But I’ve also been warned informally by work that I can’t rake up too many incidents or I’d get into trouble.

I’ve mentioned this to my partner. I’ve said that if it’s a 10/10, and it’s made clear to me, I’ll leave work. But lately, they’ve been asking me to leave again, but only suggesting leaving rather than saying it’s a “definitely need you” scenario, in which case I push back on the request, not wanting to upset management.

This most recent time, I was asked again to leave work, but I pushed back, saying it’s extremely busy at work and I can’t be the reason why my colleagues suffer. They said it’s okay, though kept hinting if I could not go to work.

I hosted Thanksgiving at my house. My husband and I have a nephew who stays with us part-time. He has a bedroom on the second floor, and my bedroom is on the third floor. It's a sweet, with a sitting room living room, two walk-in closets and the bedroom. When you walk up the stairs you walk into the sitting room, then there's a small living room, then the bedroom and then you go into either one of the closets from the bedroom. 

I have a nephew who is five, and is exhibiting signs of autism. His mother is my second cousin. She came, along with her two brothers, and their mother. So everyone's taking turns entertaining my 5 year old nephew because he requires a little bit of extra attention.

At one point I leave the living room on the first floor, and I see him on the stairs, playing with a toy car and what looks like a watch. I look closer and I see the watch belongs to my husband. And it's a pretty expensive watch to be smashing into a toy car. I asked my nephew where he got it, and he said uncle's backpack. I asked him if he could show me.

He leads me to the piano room, where everyone put their jackets and whatnot, and my one cousin's backpack. My nephew opens the front portion of the backpack, and I see some other jewelry in there....

I was really pissed off, so I grabbed his backpack, and grab my nephew and went into the living room. I dumped the backpack out onto one of the coffee tables and ask my cousin what the heck was going on with the fact that two of my husband's watches, and a necklace that belong to my mother were in his bag. 

I dumped out the bag, and the nephew who lives with me, his Switch was in there. The cousin who's backpacker was freaked out. Saying clearly my autistic nephew put stuff in there that he had taken from upstairs.

I know that's not the case, because he's not tall enough to get to the dresser where the jewelry was. Nor do I think he would even wander that far from everyone else.

So here’s the backstory: I have a pretty big family &amp; have a ton of cousins. When we were kids, it was a tradition that the adults would host a NYE party for the entire extended family to attend (even the ones out of state). They’d rent out a venue &amp; everyone would bring their own food, decorations, etc. It’s actually a really great tradition that my cousins &amp; I have continued now that we’re all adults. 

My cousins &amp; I are more like siblings tbh. That being said, we haven’t always been the greatest towards each other. I can admit I’ve done my share of being toxic but I’ve also always been picked on because I was a very shy bookworm &amp; never stood for myself. Even as adults, they leave me out of things &amp; downplay my achievements &amp; continue picking up me because I do things differently than they do. I got married (actually, eloped) recently &amp; a couple cousins didn’t approve of the engagement because they felt it was too soon. That’s fine, but they never told me about it &amp; instead went to my brother, who later told me.

ANYWAY I feel like these 2 cousins have a strong influence over the others because ever since I got married, nobody has reached out to me to hang out. I always tell them that I want to hang out with them, they just have to let me know. I’ve tried to reach out a couple times but everyone’s always busy with their own lives. At one of my cousin’s birthday parties, I learned they were all attending a concert &amp; never invited me. I got upset &amp; told them I would’ve loved to go &amp; they should’ve told me, &amp; that me being married doesn’t change me wanting to do fun stuff with them. Nobody said anything &amp; didn’t even look at me &amp; my husband told me to move on so I did. However, now I’m considering not attending the family NYE party &amp; doing something with just my husband instead. It’s pretty clear they don’t want me around &amp; I don’t want to be around people like that.

I'm a recent supervisor at a very famous hotel. Not a corporate hotel. 

Over Thanksgiving we were expecting a snow-apocalypse. For us that's just 6"" or more. But the roads aren't sanded or salted or scrapped usually. So anyone that came in would have to drive back after their shift. 

Now, most folks that work at this hotel also live in town on company housing. So it's not a huge concern. We do have a night auditor that lives in another town about 30 minutes away, as do I, and most of leadership here. So, really, this mostly impacts the 1 night auditor. 

This person does not have a truck or 4wd vehicle. And their small car is unable to navigate even 1"" of snow. Snow, as an aside, only happens once or twice a year, and usually it's a huge deal. 

The employee brought up their concerns along with other employees on Tuesday, as soon as we learned we could be facing a major winter storm (for our region). I explained that the hotel has no contingency plans and that we were far too busy handling the special Thanksgiving buffet/guests to worry about that. I explained, via text, that a good option would be to find a coworker that lives in town and stay with them, or sleep in their vehicle. 

Wednesday the same concerns were brought up. Thursday the storm was seeming imminent and only the night auditor, who would, admittedly, be here during the worst of the potential storm, brought up concerns yet again. 

Well, I lost control and told the auditor that these inquiries were not welcome at all and that there was nothing else i could do. We have another auditor that lives on premise, and the auditor complaining asked if I could contact them to work. I did not. The auditor stated that they were only concerned for their well being and safety if left stranded or forced to drive home, their life. 

The auditor was upset and finally got in touch with the auditor that lives on premise. He went over his authority. I expressed anger. He again stated that they had the right to be concerned about their health and safety during a major storm event. 

I finally caved in and secured  room for the auditor just in case. I did remind them that they are expected to be at work, and that the hotel is not expected to provide transportation or shelter during an adverse weather event. 

The next morning the auditor drove home so I sent him a text telling him that it was an absolute waste of my efforts, and suggested they were ridiculous. 

So AITA for expecting employees to deal with these situations as though it's a personal issue, and not the issue of the hotel? I feel like the employees are expecting too much. We pay them, and frequently feed them. I really don't see the problem. If it had snowed we'd deal with it then, and if not then no problem. And as a bonus: it ended up snowing hard and icing over the highway today, it took this employee over 2 hours driving to make it in on time.

She was like one of my kids. She was over one day and her and my daughter were on the bed playing on their phones. My kid went downstairs and a few hours later went back upstairs and her phone was gone. We assumed she misplaced it so we barely looked around at the time and couldn’t find it. I told her we’d look better later and continued on with them going about the rest of the evening. 

My niece went home and we searched for the phone. I did a locator on the phone but by that time it was dead and we were unable to locate it. I searched for the next 2 months. I cleared out my entire house. Moved dressers, beds, couches- you name it. Nothing. My husband said my niece had to of taken it. I disagreed and said she wouldn’t do that. I ended up filing an insurance claim and got her a new (different) phone. 

2 months later my niece comes back over. She tells my kid to look behind the same dresser that we moved to look behind and low and behold - there is the phone! No way! My husband says, “I told you!” &amp; of course we argue about it because I can’t believe that she did that. 

I didn’t tell her mom right away because there has been tension in my family and I knew she would take it offensively. So I waited and told her months later. She took it VERY offensively and said I was an asshole and should of told her sooner. She insisted that her child would not do that (of course my niece denied it) and that I was wrong to say she was a thief and a liar. I did say that maybe she took it to joke with my kid and not to be malicious but she exploded on me.

Me and my wife 37M and 36M have recently been arguing about this fact and I have stayed true to my grounds where I say walking the dog is a household chore. 

We have had a lot of fights that I have not been pulling my weight around the house recently but I don’t see where I can re

For context my wife works 12 hours per week where I work the schedule posted above.

We have had a huge fight about chores but I can’t see where I can do anymore, if I don’t do my weekend shifts we can’t afford the house we live in. 

I have offered my wife the chance to work more and me work less but she keeps saying ‘you earn more per hour than me so it makes no sense for me to work more’ which is true in its own right but I am burning out from work. 

This is absolutely killing me, I have offered her working out who works more outside vs inside the house and coming to an equilibrium that way but she has refused and says I still need to do more. But I work 7 days a week without a day off (contractor. If I don’t work I don’t get paid) and it seems to me this isn’t being taken into account at all

Recently she said I should walk the dog more (after she already has) and I said dog walking is a house hold chore as we agreed that before getting our dog as a puppy and she blew up saying I contribute nothing 

For context I wake up at 5am and make sure the downstairs house is tidy every morning, I do all dinner pots and if there is any mess down stairs I sort out before I go to work at 5.40

So Yesterday we where in a meeting and these two female friends always leave together (for security reasons) but Yesterday one left without the other (Lets call her Stacy)(she Is also under 18) and didn't even bothered tell my other friend (the one who was victim). Today I talked to my friend AND she told me what happened to her Yesterday, I was shocked since It Is the first Time It happens to someone close to me. I asked her if she told Stacy about what happened and she told me that stacy ""only said "" o I am sorry"" but in a tone implying she(Stacy) did nothing wrong. I was surpriced since they aré/where pretty close.(I would have expected atleast a hug or interest) Today as we talked about that and other things Stacy arrived and as if nothing had happened she talked about buying something (didn't really payed attention) since I am mad at her I said ""you should Buy something that prevents you from being harassed by a creepy Man"" she understood the comment and got very serious, then came back and told my friend when she was leaving so they could leave together today.

Also if there was no way they could have left together, if Stacy would have told us, a man of the friend group could have accompanied her because we have this rule where no one leaves alone an even less if It Is a woman (because were we live there Is a lot of violence against wemen and even More if they are minors)

Another friend who was there while everything happened told me that she did wrong but that my comment was too agressive, also my friend (victim) said that but she dind't seem angry ora bothered AND i dont know if i did something really bad or not. Stacy was visibly angry at me .

She's always been interested in hearing about my job and what I do for a living, so I like to call with stories about what is happening at work. 

Over the summer, her mother died just shy of 100. I expressed my condolences, and she had mentioned being depressed but getting help. I tried to keep in touch a little more, just to be supportive, she answered the phone maybe once or twice more, but now it's at the point where she's just not answering me. I tried to call her and leave voicemails, but now it's been 4 months and nothing.

I really do feel bad and I know how difficult it is to fight depression, but I guess I just feel like I'm putting effort into a relationship that she's given up on.

But while doing such things, other older co-workers(mid 20, 30s) have told me that isn’t the right way to do it. They showed me how to do it correctly and now I go to them whenever i have questions. The older co-workers told me the younger ones have trouble correctly doing their side work. The side work is restocking sodas and cleaning the lobby for the next day. After learning how to do all my work correctly, the managers feel i’m more reliable to do the work. So basically it’s me doing extra work when the younger ones slack. Now that i’ve cleared that up, let’s get into the issue and why i was upset. 

Today I(17f) was scheduled with one of the younger co-workers(18f), we’ll call her Kasey. Kasey was main CSR(customer service representative) and I was put on back-up phones so I could help in the back if needed. 

We had our usual rush between 5:30 and 7. After it died down though, we all were relaxing. In the lobby we have a chair in the corner where it’s separate from the rest of the lobby. I sat down in the chair since it was crowded in the back. 

Around 7:30ish, a lady is in the drive thru window and sees me sitting down. She made a snarky remark to Kasey. She said to Kasey “I’m sorry you have to do all this without help.” I expected Kasey to just ignore it because we’ve never had any issues together. Instead of that, she sighed a little and nodded. 

I was a little surprised and kind of confused since I’ve helped her most of the night. After the lady left, I asked Kasey if i did anything to upset her. She struggled me off and walked away. I started to get a little upset because i’m the kind of person that cares about what others think of myself. I was upset for most of the night, but I dropped it since there wasn’t anything I could really do.

I told my family about it and they said I shouldn’t have gotten upset because I was sitting there doing nothing. I do most of her work because she doesn’t do it, so it’ll naturally make me upset for her to say i don’t help her. I also feel like if Kasey doesn’t want to tell me why she’s upset, then i shouldn’t push her to.

And I said, “no it sucks because I don’t want to sit in the first row.” And Greg kept being a smiling kiss ass saying, “oh I don’t mind!” And Brian would look at me and say, “seeee???” While pointing at Greg. 
I swear my older brothers are children. 
Now I’m forced to go see a movie while in the front row because he neglected to buy tickets early and won’t own up to his mistake.

I already attend group therapy. I have 16 months clean.

The first few sessions we had were ok. I say ok as she would let me talk and make a few comments, but would do very little to help me analyze or talk through any of the things I was feeling.

Fast forward to my last two sessions. We usually meet on Zoom. The first of my last two sessions, her camera was on and I could visibly see her nodding off and taking a little bit of time to respond to anything I was saying. Her responses were lackluster at best. My last session with her was my breaking point.

Her camera has been having issues over our time together and it’s not unusual for it to go on and off because apparently the cord is short. Her camera was off during our last session and I said that’s ok because we can still talk obviously and I can hear her. Well there were at least three different times during our session where I would be talking about something and then she wouldn’t respond right away. There would be a good 15 to 30 seconds of silence where she didn’t say anything or answer my questions, which is extremely unnerving when you have anxiety. The worst part of this was when I was talking about a particular subject, came to the end of my statement, and was met with nothing but silence for a minute. When she finally did speak, it was something completely out of left field and unrelated to what I had said, where I had to literally say, “what do you mean? What are you talking about?” And she then goes into what she “thought I said” where I had to correct her and say, “ummm no, I said _____ and was talking about xyz…” so she then admits “oh idk where I was, I guess I thought you said something else.” 

We finished up the session and then booked our next one, which I cancelled. I had to go in to the office to do a UA and she saw me and in front of like 4 people asked why I canceled and if I wanted to book a new appointment. I felt really pressured so I scheduled a new appointment then, but canceled that one too.

I have spoken about this a little with my group counselor in group and stuff but my question to everyone is: where do I go from here? WIBTA if I report her straight to the board without disclosing this to my program or confronting the therapist directly? I’m terrible with confrontations and also I am not sure I can do it without becoming really angry/upset while talking about it and I want to be taken seriously. Also, I am not really sure how to approach this with the program or what I should expect them to do about it. I am working on getting another therapist but I have to stay in this program for obvious reasons and I also don’t want everyone to look at me like a Karen/AH. Hence why I’m considering just reporting her to the board directly.

Me (F22) and my ex (M24) broke up earlier this year. We were long distance and never got the opportunity to say goodbye in person or hand our stuff back to eachother. Recently I travelled back to my hometown for thanksgiving and we decided to meet up. In retrospect it was a slightly poor decision on my part.

When we met up we discussed the breakup and our terms going forward, and we had a couple drinks and walked around our city center area. We ended up eating dinner together and he asked whether or not we would hook up and I replied in a joking manner “whatever happens, happens”. I thought it was all banter, because we talked earlier about how we were over eachother and didn’t want to get back together whatsoever. 

I let him know I was heading home at around 10pm. Immediately he implied he would come home with me too, and when I said that wasn’t the move for tonight because we aren’t together anymore, he started yelling at me for giving him false promises. I was really confused because we were exes and I did not want to blur the boundaries we had (I established I only wanted to be acquaintances), but he told me he expected to stay the night because it was 10pm and he didn’t want to drive an hour back to his place late at night. He said my “whatever happens, happens” comment set up those expectations, but he had already brought a change of clothes and skincare with him BEFORE meeting me. He then explained that when we broke up (mind you this was almost 9 months ago) I said we could have a last “hurrah” if he ever saw eachother in person. But that was back when we loved eachother, and it’s very different now. 

We spent over two hours arguing and he called me a lot of names. I tried to explain I can consent to whatever is comfortable to me but he said I was a horrible person. Then he left. My friends say I did nothing wrong, but I wanted to check with the court of public opinion.

He goes to another university than I do, so we only get to see each other for major holidays. For me the limited amount of time we get is really important.

This year, my family’s plan was to have a party with the extended family early in the day and my mother wanted to a dinner with just us at night. My boyfriend missed his family’s dinner to be at ours, so his mother invited us over at night. 

The problem is, this really upset my mom because I received notice of this on Wednesday and told her as soon as I found out. I figured half the day could be with my family and the other day with his. We did the same sequence last year so I didn’t think it would be an issue this year. She hasn’t always been the best at expressing her emotions, and when I told her she immediately became hysterical. 

I told her it was fine because nothing had happened yet and it would still be more than fine if my boyfriend and I stayed at our house for dinner. She ignored this and kept insisting it was hurtful and selfish of me as well as inconsiderate. I kept pleading with her and saying we would be more than fine if we stayed and asking how I could make it right since it was still Wednesday. She ended up saying she was over it and told everyone it was okay if we went. 

It’s now Friday and she is still upset. She says I showed her how I was as a person and how badly I hurt her feelings. I tried talking with her, but every time I say something she won’t let me respond and gets more upset. I’m not sure what to do if anything. I think partly she is upset that I’m growing up now and no longer little, and she is having a hard time to let go. On the other hand, I feel pushed away by her controlling nature. If anyone tries to reason with her, she insists it’s gaslighting. I don’t want to have a tense relationship with her, but I want to be treated like an adult.

This happened when I was in middle school and I want to get it off my chest. This whole thing might sound stupid but it did affect me. At the time I(f) had a friend let’s call her Emma (f) and we were in 7th grade. I also had a boyfriend. I didn’t really see them though out the day due to us being in different classes. But we all had the same lunch together. So always at the beginning of the year I sat with Emma. She wouldn’t like it when I sat with anyone else without telling her, even though she could. So I told her one day that I would sit with boyfriend and I sat with him for the rest of the week.

The next week I sat with her and I was talking about him and I didn’t think she would have a problem with that because she also talks about boys. Later we were on the football field and she started crying because she didn’t like that I talked about my boyfriend. A mutual friend said that I shouldn’t talk to her about my boyfriend. When I talked to Emma about the problem she that I talked about him way too much and to never talk about him again or we wouldn’t be friends anymore. Me and her at that point have only been friends for a year and we did have a lot of arguments in the past but we always made up and I always took the blame. But during 7th grade I started making friends that would help me start to come out of my shell and the next time me and Emma had an argument I wouldn’t just stand in the sidelines.

Fast forward a few months and I got a new boyfriend. I started to really fall for him and Emma knew that. But when I was sitting with Emma, she would more often then not, invite people to our table and I would have to move to a new table or sit somewhere else and be alone. So I started sitting with my boyfriend and my other friends.

One day Emma sent me a message during lunch saying that I need to sit with a mutual friends new friend group. I didn’t see the message until after school and I apologized for not reading it. I said that I would’ve sit with her if I saw the message. She asked if I could sit with her forever with me replying no. She then started blowing up at me for choosing my boyfriend over my “real friends” and that I was being selfish. This led to me admitting that I feel she doesn’t care for me because she never tried to include me in conversations and only talked about her. She said that it was my fault and i was the only one who felt it. At the end of the year she texts me saying Why did you pick your boyfriend over us?I told her I didn’t want to argue and she said she was figuring it out and what I said hurt. I told her it also hurt me but then she proceeded to say that it was my fault. And again called me a bad friend and said to think of others and not just myself, I reply with a funny how you say that. We were not friends after that.

On election day, I sent a group message to My Friend/Ex (known hereafter as Ex) and our former housemates saying ""vote today if you haven't! there's a lot on the line and if you dont vote then you just like to complain. Have a great day!!""

Ex responded saying ""My first complaint..."" and mentions her mail-in ballot was at our old place and didnt want to go back and get it. 

We live in California and it's super easy to vote here, you can be homeless and vote technically.

I was in the same predicament with my ballot but I went in to my closest polling place and asked for same day reg. It took me a few minutes to fill out the form and vote.

After I voted, I saw Ex's reply I said something like "" they have same day reg. it all took me about 10 mins to register and vote""

Ex responded saying she didn't have the time or energy for that and good for me for voting but she isn't going to this time.

Being cheeky I just replied saying that I voted for the women's rights thing so they were covered.

Ex replied saying it felt like I was guilt tripping her with that statement and has been distant since. 

We dated for 2 years and remained close friends after. We hang out fairly regularly but sometimes we get on each other's nerves. She says that I act like im superior to her sometimes and it bugs her. She said something similarly after a couple weeks of distance texting me that the comments about the election upset her, that it felt like I had a lack of understanding and I had a holier than thou vibe so she been keeping a distance.

I responded apologizing saying that I'm still working on my blind spots and that I'm not intentionally trying to seem holier than thou in any way. I appreciate her letting me know what was bothering her so I can be more aware of what I need to work on specifically. I haven't heard too much from her since. 

To me, it feels like because we dated for 2 years, things I say maybe affect her differently than if someone else made a similar comment.

This was all initially in text exchange in a group chat, expect for her reply weeks later saying she was upset. I was not telling her specifically to go vote. Another person in the chat sent a selfie of himself with an I voted sticker on his hat and his dog going to the beach.

I had been going to therapy for 8 years, since before I met Ex to work on myself. I've made a lot of progress and have the tools I need to work through most anything, but I'll be the first to admit that I have blind spots and its helpful when someone calls them out so I can own them and address them.

I'm willing to admit I was an asshole and probably didnt need to make that cheeky joke, but what say you?

I have 2 kid (6 and 4). My husband and I invited my parents and brother and my niece. 

My brother has a 25 year old daughter Kayla that he had when he was 16. Kayla got married last summer to a guy named mike who she’s been with since they were 18. The two of them have a daughter Mary 9months. 

I’ve met mike a couple times. But I don’t know him well. My niece asked me if I’d rather have her, mike, and the baby stay in a hotel rather then my house so we didn’t have to listen to a baby at night.

I told my niece Kayla that I would rather her not bring mike or the baby. She got really mad and asked what the baby and mike were supposed to do. I told her they can stay home or go to mikes families house. But that I didn’t want a baby at thanksgiving. She got annoyed and hung up. 

Kayla ended up not showing up and not answering any texts from me. My brother ended up not coming either. My mom and dad shamed me the entire time. My mom even called me a selfish ass. 

My husband agrees with me. I didn’t want to invite my nieces husband and baby because they are strangers. And I definitely didn’t want a baby at my thanksgiving.

But it seemed like my mom was pushing us to go to my sister's place. Her boyfriend smokes in the house AND why make us haul everything back to our place with a baby in tow? It's an adventure just going shopping with our daughter.

Her take is that, given the historical power indifference between my ethnic group and that one, she thinks choosing that voice for my “assistant” is likely to get me in trouble were people of that ethnic group to hear it coming out of my phone. 

But the truth is I grew up in a part of the midwest where I witnessed and envied a lot of camaraderie among this ethnic group but never got to partake because of severe segregation norms. And honestly now as an adult I don’t have many friends in my own ethnic group, much less any others.  So as pathetic as I admit it is to type out, when Siri cheerfully interacts with me in that voice, it’s kinda cathartic, heart warming.

So I went out skateboarding to help calm me down and Then I came back home he sat me down and yelled at me for not helping around the house and “not being part of the family”. To stop me from crying and breaking down I just got up and left and he started getting upset even more. Next day he pulls me aside while my mum is otp with my uncle and starts sayin things like, “you’re lucky I didn’t turn your phone off. I wanted to, next time you pull a stunt like that I’m shutting your phone off,taking it, and all your other things and you will be grounded! You need to stop with these attitudes of yours and actually manage your emotions” I tried explaining it’s not easy since I have bipolar and not medicated. And I kept trying to apologize for snapping and don’t mean to and I hate doing it and it always makes me feel awful. Then he just kept screaming that it’s a choice with my bipolar. I ended up breaking down and runnin to my room. When my mum saw that, she ended the call with my uncle and started yelling at my dad saying that he was being an asshole and that he needs to understand that I can’t help my mental state and that he should try being understanding. but he blames me for her yelling at him.
