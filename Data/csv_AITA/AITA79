I have a low paying job and I get paid by the state to take care of her. It’s enough to get by on. 

When I took her in my eldest sibling put rules on me. No graveyard jobs and I need one day off on week days for mom’s appointments. I managed to do all that. It’s been a year and I notice her health declining. It’s been declining for years but there’s a scare every month. I give her her meds and she spit them out insisting that she doesn’t need them. Then she freaks out when she has problems related to not taking them. 

I have no down time to study. All the high paying jobs don’t work into my schedule. Rent has increased. If she passes I end up 1600 short a month. My current job will barely manage my expenses. I told my eldest sibling about finding a another job that will take time away from moms care and she went off on me. How could I think this way. I had to tell her moms got like 10 years max. She’s very old. 

I’m not neglecting her care. I’ll still be here to give her meds and feed her. I just need to create a safety net for me when she does pass. Still… I do feel like an ass for thinking about this. She’s old and taken care of me all my life. Making her my second priority in her old sickly age doesn’t feel right either.

I know there's a term for people who do stuff for you, but then get mad when it's not what you asked for or wanted. It turns from kindness to narcissism or something similar... I just can't seem to put my finger on it. 

Say you tell someone, ""Don't buy me clothes anymore"" or ""I'd like a smoothie"" and they buy you clothes or bring you apple cider. Now you have an article of clothing you don't want &amp; never plan on wearing, or a glass of apple cider you don't want, because little did they know you drank apple cider with alcohol 3 nights in a row prior. 

INSTEAD of being understanding and accepting, they take it personal and make you feel like complete shit for speaking your mind.

NOW the only reason you spoke your mind was in hopes that you won't hurt them again. Issue is, if you tell them you didn't want it, but you're grateful, they gaslight you into feeling like an ungrateful piece of shit... all while simultaneously walking away from the situation because they can't deal with any confrontation.

Over the years, she has told me about how she's picked on or treated poorly at different jobs she's had. She is underpaid and under-appreciated and it hurts my heart that she isn't seen and is often talked-down to by others. It happens from neighbors and people just meeting her. After others see her or sometimes speak with her, she says she feels like they end up looking down on her, talking down to her or try to bully her or steal from her. It bothers me deeply and I wish I knew how to help. The same thing happened to me for many years, although not to the same degree. 

I shared with her over dinner that people started treating me much better at work when I started to invest in my clothing and appearance more. She blew up and shared she felt like I was always making comments about her appearance over the years and it had really hurt her. She asked if she looked like a walking trash can. She said she always did look nice for work and she had really tried. I felt awful. She isn't speaking to me now. I can understand that. I didn't realize how many comments I had made over the years - or that this was something she was deeply sensitive about and mentioning it was extremely hurtful. I apologized and just shared it seemed like one of the easiest things she could change to help improve the workplace situation, from my perspective. She is already a kind, smart, good-hearted person and I don't understand fully why this happens, but it looks like I'm now one of those people who are shaming her. This sucks. So yes, I think IATA, I just don't know how big of one I am? To add to it, she's depressed and has anxiety and caring for herself is very hard for her. But being unemployed is also really hard on her. I wanted to help. I take her out with me for facials and massages once every year or so, buy her clothes and self care stuff. I recently found out that has made her feel more judged. Ughhhh I feel awful. 

For reference, she has severe dandruff which often flakes down onto her face, her hair is almost always extremely greasy even after she washes it because she only washes it once a week, she often smells funny, her glasses are old and scratched and usually dirty and don't fit her face, her wardrobe was whatever she could find under $10 (she can afford clothing and self care, she just doesn't), her skin is rashy and bumpy from not washing her face or really caring for her skin. I think it's really hurting her getting a job. She says she always dresses nice for work, but to me, it's still seems like it is setting her back and could be contributing to problems.

So I (17F) joined this art discord server two months ago from a friends invite. The first looks of it were friendly and nice, everyone was polite and it was pretty active. But two or three weeks after or so things started giving a turn. The server was mostly dead and only four people (including me) talked in it, sometimes the owner would join but very occasionally. 

I also noticed that the owner gave a lot of toxicity in the gc and vc, so I slowly backed away from it, to the point that three of us (the people who kept things alive) created another gc to evade general problems with this person. 

Now, to the present. Today, the owner was complaining about how the server was pretty much dead and that they didn't want to feel in the obligation of trying to revive it by force, and since I was pretty fed up with multiple things that had happened before (and things people have told me) I snapped and started saying a bunch of things calling them out. Basically stating that it was their fault that the server was dead because of how they acted/reacted to things. And that's when shit started to go down.

One of the mods was on our side or more like stating peace before war came. But when the owner came back and read what I said, they took things and turned it against everyone else in a very disgusting way. I even got my friend text me because he was worried that he had to choose in between me or the owner (which I told him that I didn't care [and I really don't]). Ofc, there was people on my side and people on theirs, and yet they had more power just because the people with them were mods (also not forgetting that they're the owner of this server).

But at the end of it, after the argument they started victimizing themselves and I left for my own good before I exploded on them again.

Although I'm low contact with her and my parents, I do still see them semi-regularly because I'm still close to my grandparents. 

She has this habit where anything I have, she has to have as well. It started as kids where if my parents bought me anything, even presents on my *birthday*, she'd have to get something too. It extended to her trying to make SO's cheat on me, going for jobs I applied for only to prove she could get it too, and even petty things like buying the same makeup as me, but applying it to show that she's prettier.

So I lied, and I told my cousin a ridiculously expensive bag that's absolutely not in my sister's taste whatsoever.

I told her I didn't force her to buy anything, and when I asked her why she wanted that specific bag to begin with, she ended up crying harder.

I had been friends with Jenna for almost 10 years at this point and was living with her for 6 weeks. She was an amazing friend and sometimes it's hard to believe we don't talk anymore after this, but I guess it was meant to be this way.

When I was 17 I fell pregnant with my boyfriend of 2 years, the pregnancy was horrible and I was so sick all the time, so I decided on an ab\*\*tion.

That's the secret I trusted her and very few people with because I wasn’t ready yet. The recovery was hard and depressing.

Whilst away on holiday with some girls and Jenna, she went out clubbing with one other girl, without saying anything to any of us until she was already gone. So, I sent her a reminder message, that all of us had to be up early the next morning, and if her and the other girl could sleep on the sofa bed, so none of us get woken up. She agreed, and we told her to have fun.

The rest of us girls decided to go to the bottle shop, which is when we got on the topic of my abortion, and my friend Molly told me she was hurt I didn't feel comfortable telling her, because I thought she was a b\*tch and judgemental. This was a shock to me because from my knowledge I did tell her, just a few months after the fact because I wasn't ready to tell anyone yet at that point.

Turns out Jenna had told this friend, and a few people in our larger friend group before I even had the chance, and while I was still in my depression.

I started bawling my eyes out, I was so hurt because I could never imagine spreading a secret like that to anyone. People lose families, friends, even jobs because of a secret like that. I cried on the phone to my boyfriend for an hour about it when we got back to the hotel.

Jenna got back from clubbing around 4am, and completely ignoring what she agreed to, came into the bedroom loud and drunk, trying to get into bed next to one of the girls and started arguing with her and pushing her trying to get her to move over.

Me, being angry I've been woken up at 4am, especially by Jenna, blew up a bit, and told her she agreed to sleep on the sofa bed, and she needed to get out, she was being rude and woke us all up, and I didn't want her near me after what she had done. She said that Molly was lying and that we're all assholes for trying to make her sleep on the sofa bed and accusing her of such things.

She slammed the door and slept on the sofa bed after more arguing. The next morning, Jenna confronted Molly asking why she told me, and how she was such a bad friend for going behind her back and telling me that.

Jenna's mum ended up messaging me telling me how horrible I was for getting angry at her daughter for this, and it’s my fault for getting the ab\*\*tion in the first place.

This requires a little bit of backstory. My wife (F30) and myself (M30) have been going through a year of a lot of changes. Earlier this year, my wife decided she wanted to quit her job because she hated it and wanted to instead pursue something she was truly interested in and passionate about. I have been doing well financially at my own job and, even though I knew we were going to have to cut back this year, love my wife and wanted to support her. She then enrolled at a trade school that cost $1200 per month, which I paid for, and has been doing that for over 7 months.

Fast-forward to now and a friend of ours at a BBQ today starts talking about Burning Man and my wife thought it sounded really cool (at the time I thought it sounded awesome as well). The group talks about it a lot at the BBQ. When we get home, she states she would like to go to Burning Man with me this year and asks if we could start planning it?  
Before we go into the next part, I need to say that I have been paying for our car payments, mortgage, her school, school supplies, food/toys for our 2 cats and dog, and an Europe trip to see her sister we are spread very thin financially. I had to sell a not-small amount of our investments to pay for some of these things and have done so gladly because I want to support my wife (whom I love) and our life / future together. Okay, so moving on to what happened after she asked could we start planning a trip to Burning Man.

I told her that I didn't think we would be able to make it happen this year financially and that, financials aside, I didn't think I was quite ready within myself to go to an event like Burning Man. She then got very angry with me and started shouting that she needs something to ""look forward to"" this year and that she really wants to go. I ask her ""why are you yelling at me like that?"" and then tell her that we can't afford a $4000-5000 trip for the two of us right now because we are financially tight until she starts working again / gets out of school. She starts yelling again saying how I don't understand how hard the school and this year has been and that she needs something to look forward to and dream about.  
 I then tell her that I understand its been a tough year for her (it has been) and that while it wouldn't work this year, we could plan for a Burning Man trip in 2024 together. That would give us plenty of time to save the money and also I believe I would be more excited to go by that time.  
 She started yelling at me more, saying that I could sell off more of my investments or that she could work 60 hour weeks until we saved enough for it because she needed to have dreams for the future.  
 Finally, I just threw my hands up and said we can think about it and see if we can save up enough money to go, but that I couldn't guarantee anything. She finally decided that would be enough to end the argument, but this whole situation has let me feeling very frustrated, disrespected, and unappreciated.

I (24M) became estranged from my toxic father after my mother passed away 2 years ago. I moved out of the family home when doing this and took my mother's dog with me; as she was basically shared between me and my mother and my father ""can't stand the f***ing thing"" And I also found images of bestiality on his computer (not of father personaly). 

The dog in question (Let's call her Lucy) is a good natured, mediocre behaved king Charles Cavalier Spaniel girl; who at the time of moving out was quite over weight and the vets had mentioned their concerns, nothing drastic but not good. I lived at my partners mums for a while until partner fell pregnant so we needed to find our own place to start a family properly. We found a property that accepted pets and moved in.

I started feeding Lucy set meals and limited treats in the aim of helping her to loose weight; and it worked. When baby was born we discovered that we couldn't leave Lucy to roam the house unattended as she'd knock the bin over, dig snacks out of backpacks etc, so we got her a cage to sleep in when we were out the house and overnight; this suited Lucy fine, she wasn't an energetic dog and was about 9/10 years old at this point.

A year after our first child my partner was pregnant again. After second child was born both me and my partner were either busy with kids or zapped. I kept realizing that I had forgotten to feed Lucy, I usually fed her last thing before bed but found my forgetting; I felt awful the day after and would give her an extra large portion and one too many treats in way of apology. As first child entered the terrible twos and second child stopped being a sleepy newborn, one night of forgotten food sometimes turned in to two.

At some point in this stage I had taken Lucy to the vets for a non weight related issue and asked about her weight. The vet weighed her and said based on previous weighings (from before my mother passed) Lucy had lost alot of weight but, didn't need to put any back on but advised on not letting her loose anymore. Lucy was no longer overweight. I really did try not to get back in the habit of feeding Lucy every single night but failed. I knew this wasn't fair on Lucy so I reached out to sister A to see if she would look after Lucy. Sister A gave her to sister B (I don't talk to sister B as she's close with father). I was initialy disappointed but accepted that Lucy had a better life. I found out through social media that my father had written posts detailing how it was ""great to see Lucy on the road to recovery"" And naturally when people asked what had happened, him explaining that her previous owner had neglected her, almost starved her to death and locked her in small cage, allowing her fur grow into a matted mess etc. 

Lucy was skinny not anorexic; Lucy was only in a cage when we were out the house or asleep, she was also reasonably groomed.

They told me that “this type of activity is not allowed in their house” and how I shouldn’t have dared to brought such activities with me. 

My father proceeded to put it in a bag and binned it and I just went to my room. They found it in the desk side table of my childhood bed. Maybe it is immensely disrespectful and I should’ve understood what i was walking into. The rest of my stay they looked at me with great judgement and disgust.

Once I was busy, so they hung out without me. Another time, Grace made a spontaneous hangout. I was at work, so I could only make the dinner at a nearby neighborhood. I mentioned this to them, but Grace insisted on going to the same restaurant in a farther neighborhood. I said I won't be able to make it there on time, so she said okay and went without me.

Grace also made a Thanksgiving dinner with me, her cousin, and Nancy almost a month in advance. I asked if Grace could reschedule to a different day because I have family plans. She said she can't and told me she'll still be going to the dinner with her cousin and Nancy. She later added in another friend in replacement of me not going.

Now it's the fourth time. Nancy's birthday is coming up next week. We all agreed to get dinner at an expensive steakhouse. Today, Grace texts asking if I'm fine with the restaurant because she remembers when she initially chose it, I suggested other places. I told her it's pricier than what I'd usually pay for food, but I'm fine with it because it's for Nancy's birthday. Grace replied if I'm not comfortable, she doesn't mind if it's only her going with Nancy.

I feel like Grace secretly doesn't want me to go to Nancy's birthday dinner because we all agreed on the restaurant weeks ago, but she's just now bringing this up. Added on to the fact that every time I can't make something, she never offers an alternative. She simply goes without me and makes it known. Plus when I initially said I'm fine with going because it's for Nancy's birthday, she repeated again that she doesn't mind if I'm not there.

Once or twice is fine, but I feel four times in just two months is excessive. Not once does she ever offer a different day or place. Every time I have given other suggestions, it always goes Grace's way, which adds on to my suspicion that she isn't asking simply to see if I'm comfortable.

He only recently started speaking and only speaks about things he is interested in. His speech is still not good but when he is in the mood he can talk for quite a while.

A few days ago I was visiting my sister (32F) - his mother - and spending time with my nephew. He was telling me about tigers. I was agreeing with him and asking more questions about tigers. We were talking for around five minutes when my sister comes to us and starts telling him to make eye contact with me.

She was nice about it to him, saying things like ""Hey, when we speak to people we look at their eyes, right? Can you look at your aunt's eyes?""

I didn't notice that he wasn't making eye contact with me because I also don't make eye contact with people unless I really have to. I am also autistic and dislike it. I told my sister, ""Oh, I didn't even notice that. It's okay."" I thought she was telling him to do so in order to make me comfortable, but I don't care for it either.

My sister then tells me that when I interact with her son that I should encourage social skills, including eye contact. And when I see that he is not making eye contact with me to correct him on it. I said I'm not doing that because I hate eye contact too, and I don't really expect that from him especially if he doesn't want it.

We got into an argument and after I left pretty soon after. Now my sister has been complaining to our mother that I don't want to help her son in his therapies where they are teaching him eye contact and that I'm not being a supportive aunt.

I understand that social skills are important for kids to learn, especially at an early age, and that eye contact is one of those skills. Maybe if I had access to these kinds of therapies and supports at a young age I'd be better off now as an adult. But I'm not going to enforce a 'rule' on a kid that I don't follow myself.

Am I suppose to force eye contact with him and then we both sit there miserably? Who cares about eye contact?

My mother says that I should help my sister who is already stressed enough and just treat her kid like she says, since she is his mother. I'm down to help him with other social skills that I already know and use, but this is where I have to say no.

My in-laws (both in their late 50s) were renting a house from a neighbor. No official lease, just a verbal agreement and cash payments each month. They've lived there since my husband was in middle school, so at least 15+ years. Last year, the landlord passed away and the house went to his kids. It's not a great house by any means (small, old, lots of diy home improvement that for sure would not pass an inspection for a mortgage company), but with the market the way it is obviously the kids want to sell it. Since my in-laws have no lease or paper trail, there's really nothing that gives them the right to stay there. The landlord's kids agreed to let them stay while the house is on the market, with the understanding that obviously they'd need to leave if/when there's a buyer. 

It's been at least 8 months now and my in-laws have made *zero* effort to find somewhere else to go. MIL is on disability, FIL chooses not to work (and hasn't worked for at least as long as I've known my husband). They have no savings and no credit history so I totally understand that there's limitations to where they could go. Buying a home or finding an apartment is pretty much out of the question. There are definitely some comparable options for homes for rent in the surrounding area, but they haven't looked or inquired about anything. 

They are incredibly angry that my husband (m, 30) and I (f, 29) haven't offered to let them move in with us - they've called us every name in the book and have told my husband they never want to see him again. We bought a 3-bedroom house last year and *did* have a conversation about letting them stay with us, but both agreed that it wasn't a good idea. For one, I work from home full-time (teaching) and my in-laws never leave the house so it would be a *lot* of time together. Having them move in would also result in me needing to give up my office, move my teaching space to the unfinished basement, and would leave no room for a future nursery/kid's room. Also, we're newlyweds - just got married a year ago - and having parents in the bedroom directly below the master sounds like an all around terrible idea. But still, it seems the alternative is literal homelessness since they haven't made plans for anywhere else to go. It almost seems like they were purposefully ignoring the situation, thinking that it would be easier to guilt us into letting them stay with us for free. 

AITA for not letting them move in with us? I know homelessness is no joke. I know that it's a difficult situation and I do feel really guilty. But I also feel like they had plenty of time to make other arrangements and I'm not sure why it's suddenly our problem that they didn't do what they needed to do.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4831963,public,top,self,AITA for Forcing My In-Laws into Homelessness?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6jf1z/aita_for_forcing_my_inlaws_into_homelessness/,all_ads,6,

A lot of this is because of our jobs which require us both to travel extensively, but we are currently together now going on a month because we are both on medical leave from our jobs for medical conditions. I am seriously starting to think I am wasting my time and money with this relationship. Here is a short laundry list of what is going on. Asking for advice.

Keeps our relationship a secret now for a year and a half 

Social media lists relationship status as single 

Has pictures with other women on social media but no pictures of me or us and doesn’t acknowledge our relationship in any way. Leaves comments or “loves” on other women’s profile pictures. 

Goes out without me and doesn’t invite me or ask if he can bring anything back for me

Makes me hide in his bedroom when his kids come over. His kids didn’t have anything to do with him for over a year after his divorce with their mother, so he’s afraid what they will think.

First time when his daughter came over then his son

Son brought him over Thanksgiving dinner made me hide in his bedroom for two hours then didn’t even offer me any of the food, even though I would decline it most likely if he did ask. 

Went to dinner with his daughter didn’t invite me or ask me if I wanted anything, even when his daughter brought her boyfriend and his son brought his girlfriend.

Even his family condemns him leaving me at home and keeping me a secret. His family likes me.

Chats with other women by text or social media 

I pay for almost everything, but when I’m in a bind he doesn’t want to contribute to anything. I even had him put on my health insurance so he could seek medical treatment for his back. I myself am on medical disability, and meanwhile he is receiving nonstop packages at his house for things he has bought, while I am struggling at the moment.

Expects me to pay for everything.

No intimacy at all. Blames it on his medical condition. I mean absolutely nothing zero. Haven‘t been intimate for months.

Made comment that “we need to lose some weight”

Watches me on his home cameras constantly 

He sleeps in bedroom while I sleep on the couch because his bed is small.

Just feels like I’m becoming more of a friend and support method than his girlfriend

For context, my father hasn’t been around for anything but trouble and a whole lot of drama for the last 15 years. You can say I have dad issues, lol. Even though he’s alive and lives nearby, he’s never been very much loving or even around anyways so my mom was (and still is) a single parent ever since the divorce.

About one month into their relationship, she called me to say her boyfriend told her he has always dreamed about having a daughter and now he has one. Then stuff like this kept happening (they trying to swing that daughter thing on me). Also, she’s been complaining I don’t call him enough, make eye contact enough or overall make him a part of my life enough. I do think he’s a okay guy, but some red flags I picked from his behavior (like how he treats his actual children, per exemple) makes me think I better keep a healthy distance. He’s always with her when we meet so we had multiple talks, even serious ones, but the man still mispronounces my name! That’s how well we know each other!  I never said anything about how much this father thing bothers me until this afternoon. 

Today, my fiancé and I were in a restaurant with them and they came up with a great idea: we should join our weddings. My fiancé reminded him that our very small celebration is booked for next may and paid for by us. Mom’s boyfriend argued it would be a very good opportunity to bond as a family. We laughed it off but they were dead serious about it. He went off on how we could do a major party saving so much money in decorations. I responded with a very strong no and said “I’m sorry but there’s space for only one groom in my wedding: fiancé’s name”. He looked annoyed and my mom changed the subject. 

Moments later when it’s time to pay he jokes “my daughter has us all covered”. I acted like I was joking back and said “good for me I’m not her!”. Boy were they offended. When we all got home, she called me and said I had ruined a perfectly good lunch with my attitude. I said “well, he’s not my father” and she hung up crying. 

Now I’m feeling like I waited too long to have a respectful conversation about boundaries which lead to this bitter interaction. I could have been more tolerant with this whole thing giving they are in love. My overprotective ass could be reading too much into him and avoiding bonding.

It took a number of us to get him into the ER on a 911 call because he was refusing help and pushed everyone away. After getting out of hospital he stayed one week in cardiac rehab and then got himself out. Within three days he was back in the bars with his buddies. 
  I turned to mutual friends two days ago begging them to help him by not taking him to the bars as he is close to pushing his body over the edge. Over the years he has asked us to confront him when he makes bad choices and help him stay on the path.

My MIL has never been the happiest about our relationship, but was overall supportive of our marriage. She and I butt heads a lot and have some conflicting opinions. My husband and her have a tenuous relationship as well.

There were plenty of issues about the wedding, but overall the biggest issues we have had with her are about money. His mom is uneccesarily extravagant and very performative with gifts. She's also extremely sensitive and is hurt when people don't appreciate her gifts. For example, last Crhistmas she bought my then-fiance Airpods and then promptly began to cry and say she ""ruined his Christmas"" because she got him something he already had. I come from a generous family, but in different ways. We are much more of a random-acts-of-kindness or gifts throughout the year kinda crowd and don't give big gifts at holidays or birthdays.

My parents paid for the wedding. My husband and I kept a strict budget, however, because we didn't want to overspend. We had a very small wedding in an intimate location and didn't go crazy. The wedding probably cost around $20k. Not cheap, but definitely not crazy. My parents asked what we wanted for a wedding gift and we insisted NO GIFT because the wedding itself was a gift. My MIL and FIL wanted to get us a gift. We registered for nothing, but asked family for contributions to our future home (which we hope to purchase in early 2023).

Today, she came over and gave us our gift. Wrapped in a cardboard box was several thousand dollars in cash. It was very generous and we were very appreciative. Here's the thing: it was all in one dollar bills. An insane amount of cash. Not only that, but she proceeded to stick her hands in the box, take out stacks of bills, and throw them all over our living room. 

When we did not reach our hands in the box to pull out cash and throw it, she got very upset. She said that she tried to make things fun and we didn't appreciate her. Again, she was very generous, so my husband and I tried to play along and took small stacks of bills and ""threw"" them into our laps basically. She filmed us the whole time. It was extremely uncomfortable and awkward, especially because we were very aware that we were being filmed and didn't want to appear unappreciative. Finally once we played along enough, she left us to clean up the money.

According to my SIL, my MIL has already shared the video with a bunch of family and friends and getting a lot of ""OMG THAT'S SO FUNNY UR SO CUTE"" texts and I'm just so fucking annoyed by it. I understand I am coming from a place of privilege, but either way is it worth talking to her about it?

They became our best couple friends and a third couple ended up joining our group for weekend hangouts. All was good for several years until 2016 when my husband was diagnosed with cancer and shortly after it was discovered to be stage 4. Our friends were wonderful to us when he was sick. They even had a spare key to our house and came to deep clean while we were at chemo. My husband ended up passing away in January 2017 and to say it was hard is truly an understatement. We had a 19 month old son that I was left to care for alone while grieving with very little family help. After a few months one of the friends told me I needed to “stop throwing myself a pity party” and of course that made me upset. Their attitude towards me changed drastically and when I discussed it with my therapist she questioned if they were really my friends or only my husbands. I explained that I had hung out with them plenty of times while he was out of town for work and had girls nights with the 2 other women so I was at least under the impression that they were my friends as well. This is where I’m questioning if I’m the asshole…. I called them out after they all went on a camping trip that I wasn’t invited to during the weekend of my husbands birthday the first year post loss. I dropped a lot of F bombs and let them know how much they hurt me but I didn’t call them any names or show any real disrespect, I just wasn’t thrilled. Their excuse was that the trip was planned months prior during a previous trip. We were invited to the previous trip but didn’t go because sleeping on the ground would’ve been extremely miserable for my husband as much pain as he was in at that point.

E added me on social media again about a year ago and I accepted thinking she might be trying to apologize but that never happened.

So I made a snarky comment about how she’s proved she didn’t really mean that and she deleted it and blocked me. I know I’m still holding on to an unhealthy anger towards her and I want to work to get past it but don’t want her back in my life. Am I the asshole for calling them out back in 2017 and then making the snarky comment today?

I told her not without telling me why. 

1. The bullying from her classmates from when she had bladder issues last year from anxiety, depression and teachers not allowing students to leave from their classrooms, resulting in her having ""accidents"" and then me not letting her leave school to change (I told her just pack extra clothes or wear a diaper because she's not coming home to change (even after the first time I didn't let her come home to change) after she was put on anxiety meds she had no other issues.) 

2. Her being bullied by ""Craig"" who keeps stealing her pencil case and when she told the teacher her teacher publically reprimanded her for ""tattling on her classmates"" in front of her class. 

3. She wants to start over since her ex best friends boyfriend kissed her and her friends all took the ex best friends' side, not leaving her with many friends

4. More opportunities in choir and theatre since the teacher only chooses ""favorites."" 

5. More help in math and a later start time since she has to drop her sisters off, and she's consistently late for school

6. Her siblings and their friends will stop bullying her  and because she'd have a uniform she wouldn't have to worry about her siblings stealing her clothing and her having to wear stuff that doesn't fit to school. 

I told her under no circumstances can I afford private school since the divorce, and she would have to pay for it herself and called her problems ant hills and she's being over dramatic. 

My daughter responded with ""Im not over dramatic you dont listen to me, maybe if you would've kept your legs closed and ring finger empty for longer than 6 months after dad divorced you, I wouldn't have to worry about it but instead you, dad and stepdad have made my life fucking hell"" which was hurtful to me. 

She talked to her therapist about how I'm being unfair and how I am an asshole and she shouldn't have to pay for school and she should be able to switch, and no there's not another public highschool close the next one is a 45 minute drive away. And her therapist said I should look into it.

Before we made plans for our upcoming trip I told her that I can't keep paying for everything and I need her to chip in as well. 

Based on our conversation it seemed like she agreed and was willing to pay, she already gave me some (about 20%) of the flight money, but as I was talking about splitting costs for our lodging she told me that she wasn't expecting to pay for that and she was only planning on giving me what the she already did for our flights. I told her that is not what we talked about and that I am not comfortable taking on that much financial burden again. I am looking to save up for a down payment on a house and an engagement ring for her, but her unwillingness to chip in on dates and trips is really making this harder.

I make about 100K and she makes about 55k, so I do recognize that there is substantial difference in income as well as purchasing power. With that said, she lives with family and her living costs are significantly lower than mine, allowing her to save much more money. I live alone (we are looking to move in together soon) and my living costs are higher than hers. 

We are possibly looking at $1500-2000 cost for entire 7 day trip and I although I can afford to pay that, it will be burden on me and not something I want to take on.

It's perfect, but the only issue is that I've had to move because the job is located on the other side of the country. The job is great, and I met my girlfriend in the new city but the downside to the move is that I rarely get to see my family. This Thanksgiving, therefore, was really important to both me and my family, which should give some context as to why I got so annoyed when my cousin Greg (26M) tried to ruin Thanksgiving by farting on me repeatedly.


This all started when I was 13. Greg and I were both the same age, and we both realised that we could fart on command. Since we were stupid and thought it would be funny, we spent the entire day farting on each other. At the time, I thought it was really funny, but now it seems anything but. My family aren't really close so the next time I saw Greg was at the next Thanksgiving and he carried on farting on me at various points throughout the day. At this point I had grown up a little and no longer participated or found it funny, but he persevered anyway. The year after that, I asked him to stop farting at me. He didn't. He has continued to repeatedly fart on me at every single Thanksgiving since, even though I have repeatedly told him to stop.


I don't get why he does it. He isn't a stupid dude. He is a Corporate Lawyer in New York, with a wife and two young kids, and other than this he is a completely normal guy. I have asked him not to fart on me every year, but he never listens to me. I told my parents not to invite him this year, but he turned up anyway.Not wanting to cause a fuss, my Mom served him food, which I struggle to blame her for.


When I arrived, Greg beelined towards me and my Girlfriend. I had warned my Girlfriend about Greg, so she knew what to expect, but rather than farting on us, he was lovely. He was charming, funny and my Girlfriend seemed to like him. He only talked to us for a few minutes before helping out in the kitchen, but after he left, my Girlfriend turned to me and said ""He doesn't seem too bad"" and I thought he might have been a changed man. How wrong was I...


About an hour later, right before dinner, I went upstairs to use the toilet and Greg was standing outside. I tried to walk by him but as I did, he grabbed me by the collar, said to me that he'd been eating nothing but beans for the past two days straight, and aimed the most ungodly fart directly at my stomach. I genuinely wanted to get sick, and I couldn't retaliate because after releasing his weapon of terror, Greg ran straight down the stairs. After a momentary pause, I headed back downstairs, grabbed my girlfriend, and we left without saying goodbye.


My Mom is upset, and said that I don't care about the family because I left early, and my Girlfriend is annoyed that with travelled all this way to not even eat Thanksgiving.

So to start off with I should preface that my job is in the overnight hospitality industry, and I'm a sort of go-to person when I'm on shift, I help out in every department and know what to do in the event of emergencies, but there are PLENTY of other people in various other chain buildings in the area which also run during the same operating hours. That said, we do have a very vigorous in-house training system for these emergencies, *especially* fire safety; it is very important that *EVERYONE* is signed off that they know how to do this on the system or else we are unable to use them as a go-to person on shift and managers can also refuse them to work if they haven't completed it. It is also very straightforward what to do, call the authorities, evacuate the building safely while instructing others to do so as well and contact a manager (salaried) and do not allow anyone back into the building until given the all-clear by the authorities. 

This evening was one of the two night offs, and my partner and I had spent it together enjoying one another company which is quite nice especially since we barely see one another due to our hectic seasonal work schedules, earlier in the evening around dinner my phone started to get called by work. My partner got annoyed, I have a habit of picking up phone calls from work when I'm not at work to help out team members and it really pisses off my partner, he asked me if i was going to answer it and I said no. 

Hours later, when the shifts had changed I received a call around midnight, and without thinking I picked it up without checking who it was. 

It was work, I could hear the alarm sounding in the background and people shouting at the team. 

He told me he didn't know what to do. 

It's not like he's new either, he'd been with the company for over a year and we have refresher training to complete every 4 weeks.

I am flabbergasted because to sign onto a shift you have to click a box saying ""I know what to do in the event of a fire."" I told him what I mentioned above and basically reiterated that if he didn't know that he shouldn't have signed off on it or he should have redone his training until it was basically stamped into his eyelids because fires are serious and loss of life has to be considered. 

He hung up, and I called the manager who lives nearby, but it went to voicemail so I called the other who is on their way there now, I live about 45 minutes away and I don't drive. 

Ever since I've been hammered with messages saying that I should have helped them out more, while my partner is pissed off that I even answered at all, so I'm wondering if I ATA in this situation.

My relationship with my family is quite rocky, so it’s okay for me to say my only valid relationship is what I have with my older sister.

You see my sister is currently in university. Awhile ago I was over at their (her and her husbands) place, spending the night. We were chit chatting and having fun but when my sister was telling us over a job opportunity I could feel the color drain from my face. She told us if she got the job she’d make loads and that she’s live in a famous city. 

Here is where I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have a TERRIBLE relationship with my family. Sure before I said it was eh, but I downgraded it. To be honest, my sister is the only thread I have to hold on. So you see, I feel terrible for wishing that she doesn’t get the job. But I know I wouldn’t make it without her. 

The only thing I said was a joke about how it’s a bit dangerous to live in that area which I immediately regretted. I could see she was leaning now. But after I reassured her that it was alright! That the location she wanted isn’t that dangerous which put her mind at ease.

But still, I can’t get over the fact that my only reason to live will no longer be just a buss away. She doesn’t really know how I feel about this, only the facade I’ve hidden behind.

He told us measurements of “average bundas” to “volumptuous bundas”. He would tell us ACTUAL measurements. We tried to divert the conversation but he kept on going and was so passionate.

He told us his traumatic times of settling for a “below average bunda” and how it affected him as a person. He proceeded to give funeral vows to the person he was before “bunda corruption”.

It was overly funny until it wasn’t. I told him “that’s enough bunda talk for today and we should move on”.

We are all immigrants from the same country but my SIL is from a different ethnic group and speak a different language, however she is well-liked so the fact that she is from a different ethnic group is not really an issue.

After talking to her, I told her she wasn't sensitive and offered to let my husband know how she felt about it.

They never listen and do whatever they want. 

Last night (Saturday) their whole family was at his moms— there were about 9 kids, and 8 adults (the out of town couple, another couple, his sister (&amp; her boyfriend), his brother, his grandmother, his mom and then the nephews wife. 

My boyfriend his sister, her boyfriend, his brother, and I were in the living room with all of the kids while the adults were playing cards letting their kids run loose. Which is fine, because we ended up playing with them, hide &amp; seek and tag. During this time my boyfriend went to wash his hands and came up behind the 6 year old (boy) and touched him with a wet hand and said “oh no I accidentally got pee on you” the kid became upset even after my boyfriend told him it was water. I came up to him and told him it was water and did the same joke on another child who laughed and ran away. It’s a typical dad style joke. The boy was sooo mad he went in his room and sulked for about 45 minutes. Meanwhile we all continued playing with the other kids. Eventually he came out and went to the bathroom but we didn’t think much of it until he came out with wet hands and wiped something on my boyfriend. My boyfriend and the rest of us were like “haha good one” thinking it was just water, but the 6 year old was like “no that’s pee. I peed on my hand and wiped it on you” with a straight face, he didn’t smile or laugh he was still angry. We were all shocked even the other kids. My boyfriends brother ran to the bathroom, just to confirm and sure enough there was pee EVERYWHERE! In complete disbelief we all ran to the other room and my boyfriend said “your kid just wiped pee on me” and without missing a beat the boys mom goes “well didn’t you wipe water on him.” All of the adults began laughing and congratulating the kid and we were all just in disbelief. And that’s when the argument that we were crazy and in the wrong for being upset began. His mom even threatened to kick him out. My boyfriend honestly wasn’t even mad at the kid, kids do weird stuff but we just couldn’t believe all these parents/adults being okay with him wiping pee on someone, not even as a joke but just out of anger. They all argued that we don’t have kids so we don’t understand and that their babies pee on them all the time and I was like ??

I’ve worked with many kids in many different environments over the years and I’ve honestly never a kid do something like this. I told my family this morning what had happened and my grandma and my mom said “if that was my kid I would’ve beat his ass, joke or not”

So, I have a friend group at my school and we have a chatting app that we use after school on our computers. I met a person online (stupid idea but this was 4 years ago and I was 14 and inexperienced on the internet) and over around 4 months we became friends. I added her to my friends list on this chatting app because why not, we were friends. My friends added her too because they saw her on my friends list and we started talking. They became friends with her too. 

Then out of nowhere, she messaged me and asked me if I could leave a note near where my friend group sits, at the closest plant. I was confused, but I obliged and I put it there, then had to leave for a tutorial. 

After the tutorial, I came back and all my friends were mad at me. It turns out that the reason she did this was she created a group chat with them in it, and was very mean to them. She then started claimed she went to the school we went to, and at lunch she would leave a note at the nearest plant to where she saw us sit. Because I left the note there, not her, my group assumed that I did this all on a alt.

I ended up blocking her, and telling her that was mean, and she used me but she just laughed (said ahhah in the chat since we aren't in person) even with screenshots which I sent to them, one never believed me, and two said I was an AH for making friends with her in the first place.

I (M18) was on vacation at a resort in the Caribbeans with my family and our group of family friends a few weeks ago. I practically grew up with them, and I love them like I would family.

Around 11 at night I was dancing at the resort's ""club"" area, having fun. However, there were a group of 4 men who came. It was obvious they were college-aged, but they were trying to flirt with the underage girls that were there. 

For context, the resort knows who to serve alcohol to based on the color of the bracelet used to get around the resort. To check this, they use a passport (remember this detail for later). With the bracelets, it's impossible to not know who's under 18 and who isn't.

It bothered me when one of them was flirting with one of my family friends. We'll call her Jane (F16). She had turned 16 on the day before, but to a passerby she looked to be 14-15. The guy who was flirting with her had an adult pass. He even offered cigarettes and alcohol a couple times. Jane couldn't smoke, however, since the matches didn't work and the bar closed

Around 12:30, they left and I followed them. I wasn't comfortable leaving the two of them alone in a private space behind closed doors. My thought process was that if anything bad happened, it would be better to have someone like me around (Guy has a knife, tries something sketchy, etc).

Eventually, Jane and the guy, who I'll call Joe, tried to confront me. Joe tries to claim he is 17 and tries showing ID to prove it. Not only is the florida ID he showed sketchy, but he also has a worn out NY State ID, which he claims is how he got an adult pass (remember that they check passports). At that point Jane is still angry, and I get fed up and leave.

On the way back I see another one of the 4 men, we'll call him Don. I asked Don's age and he said he was 18. When I describe Joe and the fact that he's trying to get with a girl who had just turned 16 the day before, there was shock on his face, before he proceeded to tell me a speal along the lines of ""nobody cares here, do whatever"".

Jane tried to paint me as a bit of a voyeur/stalker when she blabbed the story to anyone who would listen. I understand that I have to let people make their own choices, but there were too many red flags for me to sit and do nothing at the time. For me, inaction is an action. If it were someone closer in age to her I wouldn't have done anything. People should be free to experiment that stuff in a safe environment. At the same time, men over 18 who are attracted to girls who don't look over 15 have a name.

Am I the asshole here?

My (38F) husband died 3 years ago. He was terminally ill and asked that his ashes be turned into fireworks (there are companies that do that). He said that after a couple of years /when I was ready, that was his wishes. 
I am ready to start planning this. It will be close family, not a big event like the funeral - me, mum, dad, hub's siblings (+partners +kid), sister, SIL. It will involve an overnight stay as it will be 300 miles from home (at significant place for hub and I). My direct family are likely to rent air bnb flat together - we will talk a lot as a group of 10-13 people, then hub's family will leave to stay in separate flats/hotels, while my direct family stay with me. 

Since husband died, my sister (29F) has met and become engaged to SIL (27F). I am uncomfortable with SIL coming to the memorial.  

Reasons for this are:
- I find SIL difficult.  She is not a bad person but loud, dramatic, unpredictable - I am autistic, this puts me on edge. This memorial will be hard for me and I want to feel as comfortable as possible. 
- SIL has handled conversations about grief badly - with me and others.  Eg. few months after hub died, asking questions about him then interrupting when I started to answer, talking about a new topic (happened a few times, and was hard as I'd only met SIL once/twice so wanted to make a good impression, but didn't really feel comfortable talking about hub to anyone at that point, so I was trying to answer her questions... only for her to not listen and talk about something else). Talking to my aunt about death of aunt's children, cutting aunt off to talk about her (SIL's) grandma's death. I don't think SIL was being purposefully rude - maybe she was trying to make connection - but it was poorly judged.
- generally SIL is not emotionally mature, I would not want to be having deep conversation about emotions with her around. I do not trust her emotional judgement - I think she might take things out of context or make incorrect assumptions. Part of the purpose of the memorial is an opportunity to speak about hun, trauma, grief etc. I find this hard to do but want to. SIL being present will negate my ability to have those conversations.

I have spoken to my mum about my concerns. Mum says she will have a chat with SIL about not trying to push me to talk. 
But, I still do not want her there - no matter how 'well' she behaves, I will feel less able to fully participate if she is there. I accept that it is not fair, but it is what it is. I don't want to hurt SIL or sister. But, I think this is a situation where I should put myself first.

I’m a fifteen year old boy, and earlier I was making dinner, which was spaghetti. The pasta had just finished cooking, and I was about to move the pot from the stove to the sink when my headphone cord got tangled on the circular knob thingy that you use to open a nearby drawer.

My mom had walked into the kitchen just as this happened and started yelling at me for not being careful. I got the cord untangled and was picked up the pot and had began to walk to the sink when my mom began yelling at me to take my headphones out. At that moment I couldn’t do that, because I was using both hands to hold the pot. 

I was about to explain that to her when she grabbed me and quickly yanked me around to face her. And even though I had the lid on the pot, some of the water splashed out and got on my arm.

I said “damn it” out of shock/pain/whatever and my mom began to yell at me more, and my dad yelled to “watch my fucking language” from the other room. 

My mom began yelling at me for swearing, and eventually I started to yell back. I asked them not to do that when I’m holding a pot of boiling water, but my mom started yelling at me for being disrespectful. She told me I was fine, and that I wouldn’t of gotten hurt, but wearing my headphones what was really dangerous.

I probably should’ve told her about the water that got on my arm, but I felt like I was about to cry, and didn’t want to get yelled at more.

My parents yelled at me more about being disrespectful and that it wasn’t okay to use that language around them and that they could use that language but not me, and sent me to my room.

So now I’m here and my arm hurts. I know I’m the asshole here, but part of me says this wasn’t my fault. So I just want the internet to collectively slap that out of me.

To start with I (28F) handle the finances in our household so my husband (29m) doesn't always know exactly how much money we have to spend on extra things so it isn't uncommon for him to ask if we have the money for him to buy something. I have been trying to put money aside to pay off some of our debts and he knows this, but otherwise we tend to live paycheck to paycheck.

My husband (29m) wanted to go on a trip for the week to learn more about his crafting hobby that he is eventually wanting to turn into a business. He has no more PTO due to him using the time to take care of me when I was recovering from surgery. He asked if it would be okay for him to go on the trip and I told him that is his decision but I will make it work if he does. He decided to use a lot of the money he saved up from selling his crafts and go, though he will still need to use our paychecks for a few things like gas.

Here is where I may be the AH. He messages me saying that he knows it would probably be a bad idea but a friend was offering to sell him something for $300 when it would normally be $500 and he just wanted to run it by me. I got upset with him for asking when he knows that he will be missing a paycheck and it makes me feel like the bad guy when I have to constantly tell him no to the things he asks for. Sure I could technically pull the money from our savings but that was supposed to go to our debts and it will just make it take longer to pay everything off.

He got a little upset because I was upset, but he accepted the answer and said he was sorry for asking. But now I'm sitting alone in the house feeling like the AH for being upset in the first place when all he was doing was checking with me first.

For some context, I’ve grown up in a Christian household &amp; my parents always preached the idea of marriage before having children &amp; that’s honestly something I wished for myself.

My boyfriend &amp; I have been dating for over a year. He had mentioned wanting children before marriage as that’s just the way he was raised and he never had that many people who were married around him to set an example. I’m the complete opposite when it comes to this as my parents have been married for 28 years and I’ve witnessed a lot of healthy marriages growing up. I’ve always expressed how important getting marriage first was to me &amp; we both settled on the agreement to get married before children. 

I was on birth control for around 8 months but I couldn’t handle the side effects any longer. Plus, I developed an ovarian cyst and it was growing so the doctor told me the hormones from the birth control could possible be the reason for its growth so she advised me to come off birth control and look into another form. I was off the pill for one month and that’s the month I conceived. 

Obviously my hope for marriage first is no longer possible. However, yes I asked my boyfriend if he could at least propose to me sooner. I guess I just want the security of knowing for sure that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me ( it’s one thing to think it but it’s another to know through actions). He had said that he didn’t plan on proposing to me until late 2023. The baby is due in the summer and I want to be engaged before we make the announcement to my parents and friends.

She is diagnosed with a personality disorder and bipolar disorder.

She lived here for a month. This was my own offer because she was in a dark place and I wanted to help her. When she went to live in her own apartment again, I lent her some stuff she needed for her new job.

I lent her my old iPhone and laptop. The reason she didn’t have this stuff is because she smashed her phone and laptop when she had a breakdown. She also still had the keys to my home when she left.

Two weeks after this, we got into a fight. At first I hoped we could resolve it, but it soon became clear that was false hope. I asked for my laptop and house keys back over text. The phone she had already smashed to pieces after our fight.

&amp;#x200B;

It went like this:

**OP:** *I know we’re not on speaking terms, but I really need my laptop and keys back. Can I come over to get them?*

**Faye:** *I don’t have time right now*

**OP:** *Okay, when do you have time?*

&amp;#x200B;

No reaction, then finally:

**Faye:** *You can get your stuff. It’s in front of the door*

&amp;#x200B;

This freaked me out, my laptop has tons of personal information on it (protected with passwords, but still) and the keys are literally for my home. Those things in the hands of the wrong person could end really bad for me.

**OP:** *What if someone steals it before I get to it?*

To which she only responded: *Not my problem.*

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is that I found my stuff thrown into the communal hallway in a plastic bag. The bad news is that it soon became clear she had used that bag to store trash. It smelled awful.

&amp;#x200B;

Two months later, I got a text from her that I still had her Sandman omnibus and if she could have it back. I put the book in a bag and put it outside and then said: *sure, it’s in front of my door.*

**Faye:** *Wait no, I’m not in the city right now*

**OP:** *Not my problem*

&amp;#x200B;

After this, she started trashtalking me on social media for not giving her her book back that costs 80 euros. She made it seem like I didn’t want to give it back.

I reacted on her post and told people what had really happened and that if the value of objects had something to do with it (because she put so much emphasis on the €80) that the phone she broke was worth €700 and the laptop €1000. She smashed the first one ON PURPOSE and put the second one in a trash bag for anyone to find.

A lot of people turned on her after this, said ‘what goes around comes around’, but there were also a vocal few that said I was the asshole because I don’t have mental health problems and she clearly has, so her behavior is to be expected but mine is petty. That I should have been the bigger person. The people saying this are mutual friends.

For starters my sister and I haven’t had the best relationship and a lot of it possibly had to do with the large age gap we had. I was the  little sister that always wanted to be around my sibling which she didn’t really like  and we didn’t become close or build a friendship until we were closer in age. 

Our personalities clash a lot because I  like the keep the peace in every interaction I have and my sister can be argumentative and one sided at times.  So one day myself ( 26F) my sister (33f) and some acquaintances decided to go out with friends . Some of the people we’ve known for years while others have only spoken to each other in passing a couple of times. While we’re on the way to one of the bars someone starts playing music and with every song that came on my sister would make a comment about the lyrics such as “ oh my gosh this is a lot” or “this song is inappropriate turn something else on” so finally the girl my sister was speaking to said my sister was being annoying. 

While we’re at the bar my sister was visibly annoyed so she told me that the girl playing the music made rude comments to her but she addressed it so everything’s fine. The rest of the night was fine and everyone laughed and enjoyed themselves… or so I thought. While we’re on the way home my sister told me that she didn’t like how someone  she didn’t really know called her annoying and asked me if I would say that to someone. I told her that I probably would but wouldn’t use that exact verbiage because it can be a bit harsh and context on a situation is important. 

I also told her that the girl that called her annoying seemed nice but probably should’ve stayed home because her energy was a bit off and shouldn’t have made some of the comments she did( for context the girl that called my sister annoying had to work early the next day so it seemed like she was annoyed with anything and everyone that night ) 
After the conversation I thought everything was fine but now my sister disinvited me to her birthday party and said we’re better off as sisters and not friends.
I asked my sister why she felt this way and she said it’s  because she would expect her friends to stick up for her. She told me that when she told her other friends what happened they all said the girl was wrong for what she did and that I validated a random person calling my sister/friend annoying and that isn’t something a friend would be ok with. I apologized to her and explained that I never thought it was ok for someone to call her annoying and tried to explain where I’m coming from and that I will do better to work on our friendship but now she said she doesn’t want to speak to me and I don’t know what to do to fix this",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4831769,public,top,self,AITA for telling my sister I don’t see a problem with someone calling another person annoying after it happened to her ?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6hz89/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_see_a_problem/,all_ads,6,

Another time I had to use an old candy bar wrapper (and got dangerously close to touching the dookie). I don't let my dog poop or pee on yards that have a sign not to. 

But today on my walk my dog saw another dogs old poop on a lawn and peed on it. She does this often, I think it's a scent thing. The owner of the house was coming out at the same time to see my dog and as I started to walk away she stopped me and asked if I was going to pick up the poop. 

I explained to her that it wasn't my dogs poop and she simply peed on it and so it wasn't my responsibility.  She said she SAW my dog crouch and poop and it was hers. As you get to know your dog you can tell if they're peeing or pooping and I tell her it wasn't my dog. I even show her the how the poop is old and much too big from my small dog. 

She said she was positive she saw my dog poop and even if it wasn't my dog I should clean it up because my dog peed on it, which makes me responsible in some way. At this point I was fed up and we walk away. She doesn't follow me but calls me a bitch under her breath and other things I can't hear anymore.

Yesterday, we had a dinner and i order what I always order ravioli or foie gras. My boyfriend always picks the same places and we can’t do it everyday as I have to study, so does he. 

Me and him got into a spew at dinner where you are quietly arguing around your breath and it makes you more angry as you can’t say what you want to say as there are other tables near you. 

This spew was about trajectories and his father, whom I’m not that fond of nor is he really fond of my father. 

We proceed to carry on spewing and we aren’t saying anything endearing, until we finish our dinner and he is so pissed off, he wants to humiliate me and make me pay. Even though this is a restaurant we always go to, so, the hostesses know us. 

They immediately put the bill on his side of the table and he pushes the bill envelope to my side bitterly. With that face of “got you now” and he just laughs, when the hostess clearly sees that we are trying to provoke one other. 

I am quite traditional, so I don’t think a lady should pay for the bill, letting him in my apartment is enough compensation. He knows this, that is why he was overly smirking when he put the bill on my end, so I pay and leave. 

I get a cab even though he is telling me that I’m overreacting and he drives back. That night was the night we stay at mine, so, I didn’t open the door for him. I just gave him his sleeping shirts through the window.  Which got to him and he messaged me saying that “it wasn’t that bad, can you not take a joke?” &amp; “throwing out my clothes was too far”. 

He proceeded to drive off, but, I was wondering if what I did was overboard or “too far” as it seem to really hurt him.

I know the boys since childhood. The girl is a good friend since 3 years. 

First boy is 32 years old and never worked in his life, has always money problems and tends to tell others what they should or shouldn’t do in life. He annoys the f out of me but we know each other since childhood and I tried my best to help him (find a therapy, a job, school) but he always finds another excuse or reason to shut me down or why he can’t change. So I told him to finally suck it up because his life is pointless without anything he fights for. 

An other friend is successful in his career but he smokes so much pott, his home looks like a shithole and smells like one. Everywhere is trash, it’s disgusting. I offered help many times, cleaned, repared stuff, but he stopped accepting my help and it annoys me that he has no drive to clean his mess. So I told him he is messy af and his home is disgusting. And as a 33 year old man he should finally step his game up. 

The Girl friend is so deeply disturbed by trauma, is 40 and still not able to be genuine. She trash talks everyone and is always the lamb in her own stories. When criticised she starts to cry and finds a reason why she ain’t wrong. So I told her she should stop to play the victim and finally needs to get the courage to be the protagonist of her own life.

I've been friends with my friend for many years, we met in college and we were basically instantly friends. It's been about 10 years since we first met. He got married and moved away which honestly, despite how I feel about his wife as a person, I'm very happy for him because he was very unhappy with his previous relationship. My issue now though is that hanging out with him has become very difficult, I used to make the road trip to visit him pretty often and when he and his wife had time they would come here. But over the years I've stopped visiting nearly as often and that's because I really don't enjoy it. Ever since my friend got married he doesn't do anything without his wife, we used to hike but his wife doesn't like hiking so we don't hike, we used to go to the movies but his wife does n't like the same movies as us so we don't go to the movies, we used to play video games but his wife doesn't like video games and I assume you get the idea.I get it to an extent, I've got friends who are married and there's a phase where they are inseparable but my married friends don't mind spending time without their spouses.

I don't like making the five hour drive to visit them because when I do I end up paying for a hotel so that I can visit my friend, sit in his living room and make small talk with him and his wife for a few hours. I've tried talking to my friend before about going out without his wife so that we could go for a walk or something but he tells me it would be unfair for his wife to not hangout with someone while he does and that we would be ditching her.

My friend and his wife are coming by next week and he invited me over to his parents so that we could sit in his parents basement with his wife and catch up. I want to spend time with my friend and catch up with him but I don't want to do it with his wife which I know sounds mean but sitting in my friend's parents basement and making small talk for a few hours isn't how I want to spend my weekend. So I instead offered that maybe he let his wife catch up with some of her friends and that he and I could go out and give her some space, he told me that his wife would rather they spend time together with his friends and her friends. So I told him bluntly that I don't enjoy spending time with his wife, that although I do like spending time with him I just really don't want to spend another day making small talk about nothing with someone who I know doesn't like me and makes comments about me behind my back. Now he's telling me that he doesn't think we should hang out any more because his wife was reading through his texts, a thing that she regularly does, and didn't appreciate that I said that I didn't like her as they are a package deal.

My (24M) sister (23F) just ended a roughly 4 year, moved away from home for college, lived together in a house, getting married anytime now relationship. The guy (24M) was nice, but that’s all my family could really say about him. He was very anxious, hardly spoke, and was wayyyy too into sports. No one felt like they knew him after 3-4 years and multiple family vacations, weekend getaways, etc. No one in my family is too upset that he’s gone, and we were happy and supportive of her decision (it was a long time coming, my sister is super genuine, very bubbly personality, always excited about even the smallest things). He was holding her back. This was about 7 weeks ago, mid-October timeframe.

Last week she told me and my parents she has a new boyfriend and they have been together about a month. Easy to judge, but all I said was “if you’re happy that is all that matters”. My close family can’t converse without poking fun and giving shit to eachother, and she sees it as judgement and people just giving her an opinion. Which she’s definitely not wrong. Her and I have always been more of a team growing up than enemies, and I try and have a different perspective, find nuance, see things from her POV so she doesn’t feel scrutinized all the time. Or at least I like to think I do.

This one however I don’t think I can. Our family Christmas party is this Saturday, and she asked if she can bring him. I don’t think she should, both my mom and dad think it’s too soon, and I honestly don’t see how she doesn’t see it as too soon. I mean how are any of my family supposed to take him seriously? The same day the old bf moved out of their house, she let us know there was a new one. With all the opinions and shit-giving my family does, I think she’s only setting herself and new boi up for disappointment.

I also see how this makes me no better than the old shit-givers of the family, with the opinions and the I know what's best for you remarks. So I have been back and forth over whether its just my own (and my families) perceptions that are turning this into a big deal when its really not, or whether our hesitation has some merit. We all would like to meet him eventually, just not sure if the family Christmas party this soon after her last relationship ended is the best way to do it.

AITA?

I created a ton of comics when I was younger, but began to have less and less time to draw as I got older. I still draw now, and after what happened today, this will only encourage me to draw more. My artstyle is very similar to Happy Tree Friends, which influenced me heavily when I was younger. So, about two or three months ago I created this comic involving my three original OCs (you can go on my profile to see it if you wish). I was proud of how it came out, so I posted to Tiktok, my Instagram, and here. However, my mom saw it and she said it was disgusting. She told me it was offensive and told me to take it down. First of all, I told her it was my artwork, my TikTok page, and my OCs that I can do whatever I want with. She proceeded to scream at me by saying ""Why does it have to involve family!?"" And ""Is it true!?"" (Which it obviously isn't) And ""You sound like Johnny!"" (Johnny was a foster kid my grandmother briefly took care of. He was mentally unwell and turned out to like dark humor stuff) I got annoyed at her and flat out said, ""Clearly this stuff isn't true. I don't know why you're getting butt hurt by it."" She ended the argument by yelling at me to take the post down and mumbled that I don't respect myself. 

So, I blocked her from my social media and private the video. I'm currently making a new comic with a similar joke, but will scrap it when I hear from you people.

Obviously I wanted to let him know so he could maybe have his gift go with mine (games, accessories, etc). My brother got furious with the fact that I got his son an expensive gift and was now expecting him to also get him a biggish gift. I tried to explain that it wasn't the goal to make him to spend that much and he is making me return the PS5. He has gone as far as to revoke my invitation to his son's birthday party at the end of this month.

The reason why I got my nephew the PS5 is because to be honest I am a bit more well off than my brother. My brother is a single dad who is just recently widowed and is still adjusting to everything. Meanwhile I just graduated college and have essentially gotten a 'big boy' job. With that job it obviously has perks with is a sign on bonus that I decided to use for my nephews gift. My brother basically raised me ever since we were kids because my parents were both working to make ends meet, so this feels only fair that I show my gratitude to my brother after all these years. But I know my brother and he most likely sees it as me pitying him, though I'm not. I talked to my parents about it and they also seem to think my present is too extravagant and a bit tone deaf considering my brother just lost his wife (terrible to say but another source of income as well).

I own a condo and he currently lives with his parents.

However, the biggest concern I have is that he has a 10-year-old Saint Bernard. Now, I love animals and have a dog and a cat of my own, but if I'm honest, I'm a bit intimidated by his dog's size (I'm rather short and she weighs a good 30lbs more than me) and my cat is terrified of her. I've always felt a bit of apprehension about this but have figured I'd get over my fear (as will my cat) once we're all together. I also love things being clean, so I will acknowledge I have an issue with the amount she drools but also realize that is my own problem that I need to get over. 

So this weekend, we were out of town visiting my family and we come back to town and find out that she's been having some health issues. Including being unable to walk up stairs. This was big to me because in order to get to my condo you need to walk up two flights of stairs. His dog does not have any joint issues, but let's face it, she's at an age where her health will begin declining. She's been doing better so I talked with my partner and told him that it might not be in her best interest to move in together yet given the stress on his dog and the stairs. A big fear of mine is that as the dog gets older, she will have trouble with the stairs and I will physically be unable to help her. My partner wrote this off and said that she will continue to be fine and we shouldn't change our plans since she's currently so healthy for her age.

I'm not convinced and it's been really on my mind. At his parents' house, the dog doesn't have to go up any stairs and she has a large backyard. As a bit more information, I bought my place about 1.5 years ago with all of my savings and am not in a financial place to be able to move for probably quite a while. His parents also rarely are in the house now that they are retired (about once every 4 months or so for a few weeks). So I think it would be better to delay moving in to make sure the dog is comfortable as she continues to age. I'm worried this will be a fight because it's not my dog and thus not my decision to make.

So Reddit WIBTA if I told him we shouldn't move in together until after the dog passes away? (obviously, if we have that conversation, I'd use nicer words and more tact but I'm trying to not sugarcoat anything here!)

Attending was me (38M), my wife Olivia (28F) both of our sets of parents and a few aunt/uncles. Dinner was at my parents house.

We had dinner without incident and I offered to help clean up.

My wife went to the living room with a bottle of wine and a few of the others. 

As we started to clean, noise from the other room got louder and louder. I already knew that Olivia had a few drinks already and I was dreading what was coming. 

When Olivia drinks, she gets loud and starts talking about things in our relationship I would rather stay between us. Stuff like our sex life, money, etc. 

As we finished cleaning, I went to the room they were in and Olivia was finishing a story about an embarrassing sex moment I had recently. I could tell she was tipsy. And she knows that I don’t like her telling those kinds of stories to people. 

I got pissed and told her that we needed to leave. When she started to argue I told her, in a loud voice, I was leaving now with or without her. She got up, we said our goodbyes, and left. 

She has been pissed at me since saying that if I wanted to leave I should’ve just left without her and that I embarrassed her. I told her she embarrassed me by telling the story about me. 

I’m honestly torn. Did I overstep? I know I shouldn’t have yelled but she knows how I feel about it.
