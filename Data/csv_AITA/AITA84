She asked us if she could live with us because she would rather live with family than strangers. Which is fine. Before we moved her in we set ground rules. Don’t be disruptive after 9:30pm because we both wake up early for work was the main one. Now for context, Mum has been a stay at home wife/mother her entire adult life, she went from her parents to my Dad, a very traditional European family background. Dad provided everything for all us so we never wanted for anything and Mum didn’t have to work. Because of this Mum became nocturnal. Back to the problem at hand. From the moment she moved in, she has made no effort to be quieter at night, she doesn’t pitch in with the cleaning, not even simple menial things like emptying the inside bin to the rubbish bins outside. For example, one night I went through paper in the inside bin and the whole bag was sunk into the bin with a boxed dinner box squashed on top. I went upstairs and asked if I could talk to her. All I asked is that next time she sees the bin full could she tie up the bag and take it out instead of crushing more rubbish on top because it’s messy snd hard to pull the bag back up and out. She came downstairs hugging and puffing in frustration, banged things around and opened and closed doors aggressively and loudly. I’ve repeatedly asked her not to be noisy at night, so what does she do? Decides to move furniture between rooms by herself at 10pm. I’ve now asked many times for her to please change her behaviour because we’re not sleeping the whole night through. My partner is now understandably cranky and tired all the time. She’s been living with us since July. About a month ago we asked her to please find somewhere else to live because she isn’t integrating, she’s only imposing her way of life on us with no consideration for us. Today I had a very serious conversation with her about it basically saying she needs to take me seriously when I tell her these things because I’m not just saying them to make her life harder, I just want peace and harmony. She only responded with “okay, thank you *insert my partner’s name*.” As if to say I can’t think for myself and that my partner sent me. After an hour of thinking about how that went, I sent her two links to potential share houses. One place she’d love on the ground floor of a two story house with no shared spaces and the other has shared spaces but only women of her age either widowed or divorced live there, so it would be easier for her to live with strangers as she’s never had to before.

We have been friends since high school but within the last two years, our friendship has been nothing but rocky.

Backstory: I lost my parent in highschool and had to deal with the grief alone. About a year ago, this friend of mine lost a close relative and then lost one of his parents within days. He only looked to me to talk about all of this because I knew what he had gone through but to an extent. By this time, it had been years since my loss and we had different ways of handling it. I stayed home because leaving the house, in my mind, was selfish of me and my friend makes plans with anyone to avoid not being home.

I really wanted to be there for him and I tried but work and transferring to another college were my priorities. I told him numerous times both my parents wanted me to be a college graduate so school was a priority and saving money too. In the beginning he was calling me every single day but I worked my job almost 6 days a week for being part-time then went home to do homework.

I told him numerous times I was tired and didn’t feel like FaceTiming. He knows I don’t like FaceTime either yet still called me a lot. His other group of friends didn’t even try in the beginning to console him and made excuses for not seeing him yet would post that they were with each other. This group just had to pick one struggle, either be stupid enough to post that they were out or not help their friend with his losses, they picked both.

I may be TA for not hanging out with him and taking his calls/texts after the first few months because I was the only person he went to about it and I did care about his pain but it became too much to try and care for by myself. I wanted to be there but I felt suffocated by his grief while still dealing with my own.

He told our friends that he felt like I was able to handle everything considering what I went through but now he just feels abandoned and doesn’t expect much from me. I feel like he took my words so personally that I felt I couldn't say anything anymore. Our friends wanted to help him but he didn’t even try to reach out to them until after I left for college. Now this burden is on my best friend.

There are a lot more details I could include but I am limited with words so let’s skip ahead in a time. I transferred to an amazing university; this guy and I rarely talk anymore because he knows now apparently that I am extremely busy with clubs, school, and jobs.

The problem still is his attitude towards me. He’s resentful and plays the victim any time I sarcastically make a comment at him. He sees playful jabs as personal attacks but it’s worse when it comes from me. I went back to counseling recently since I couldn’t deal with every emotion he had and being away made me reflect on how shitty he has been towards me. College is difficult without my parent here to see how far I have come. I felt alone in dealing with his emotions and it became too much to bare but was I not there enough?

My husband (36) and I (27)  came back to my country because his country is now at war.  My grandmother has a house where no one lives at the moment. My uncle (52) used to live here on and off because he had kind of a bohemian life. But since four years or so he has his own house in another region, 7 hours by car away and he’s coming to this house when he has holidays. 

Now when we came back with my husband, we had absolutely nothing, no home. So my grandmother let me her house of course. And my mother said we could stay for a few years while we get back on our feet. 

My uncle has issues. We don’t know exactly what as he refuses to see a therapist. I would expect a typical person to stop coming to the house while we live there. But he didn’t. 

Since we came back he’s coming every three months when he has holidays and he doesn’t even tell me directly. First he came one week and we managed to leave because he is extremely difficult to leave with. Three months later he texted me one day “I’m coming tonight”. I was upset but I made the bed for them and my husband couldn’t sleep because he was wondering if they arrived or not. The next day we got up and they were not there. They actually stayed at a friend and he told my mom they didn’t want to “disturb us during our honeymoon” - it was five months after our wedding and we both work at the moment… he still came by for an afternoon during a work day with my mom to check some work that has to be done in the house and started yelling as usual. So my husband came out and told him that he was disturbing him by being noisy while we work. He calmed down but then texted my mom saying we all hate him, we don’t want him here, we don’t understand him and we don’t take care of the house. He said he’d be back in November and that he’d call. Never called, didn’t came. 

Now back to today. I’m going to celebrate my birthday in December, and I also want to celebrate New Year with my friends. Grandmother is okay with me inviting over, and my mom will be here. So we decided to text him that the house will be full on my birthday and on New Year, and we also asked if he planned on coming for Christmas or new year (usually his son is with him one of those alternately each year and he never comes without his son). 
He answered something in the lines of “I’m hurt and in pain, everything suck, you don’t give news but you decided everything for the holidays, that’s great, have fun”

I want to tell him that I “decided” for one night but he can still come the other days (like between Christmas and new year) but at this point, if he’s going to be that way, I’d rather he not come at all. 

My friends think I shouldn’t answer at the top of my anger, my mother said it’s unfair to exclude him from the family, my husband is annoyed as well and usually doesn’t want him to come ever but even now he’s telling me not to answer at all.

little back story : I (22F) have lived with my parents the past couple of years with covid and everything going on- my dads two rules about me living under his roof was 
1) i had to have a job, part time or full time he didn’t care, and if i didn’t have a job i needed to be going to school. 
2) no smoking weed. 
My biological mom was a heavy partier and drug user and my dad avoids the stuff like it’s the devil so i get his rules. i never smoked weed under his roof. i am of legal age to smoke weed, i do it socially and even at that i’m not a huge fan of being so high i can’t function.

My dad has a group of friends ranging from 27-45, they all have get togethers and ever since i turned 18 and was an actual adult they pretty much all included me in their outings and i would consider myself “friends” with most of them, i had  all of them on various social medias and they send me invites and updates on their lives. a younger couple in the group and i became friends and i added the wife to my “private story” on snapchat.

 on halloween i went to a party and posted a video with me and a guy sharing a joint onto that private story, i was staying the night at the house where the party took place and didn’t get so high or so drunk that i wasn’t able to function. well this lady took the video to my dad and it caused him to start a huge fight with me that landed me in the ER needing to be sedated because i was hyperventilating and so anxious that i had a panic attack. at the time of the fight i was going through a hard time mentally, my dad accused me of being high 24/7 and said he “suspected it” and the video just confirmed it.  needless to say i took all of my dads friends off of my social medias, every single one of them.

my dad brought it up to me tonight and basically asked why and i said it was weird that he has to use his friends to spy on me. i wasn’t going to not post what i wanted on my socials bc his friends would tattle on me. my dad kept saying that his friends love me and that they were just looking out for me but i just said, they are your friends- i have no obligation to have them on social media. my mom agrees with me but my dad thinks i’m the asshole for cutting his friends off for “one mistake” his words, not mine.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4829222,public,top,self,AITAH for removing my parents friends from my social media?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5u3zw/aitah_for_removing_my_parents_friends_from_my/,all_ads,6,

Things are serious and we are planning on moving in together once her lease ends in January. My GF's family lives out of state, and we agreed to go visit them over Christmas. However, I've been having second thoughts on going to her family's for the holidays because of her mom's behavior.

My GF's mom (Joann) suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) while she was pregnant with my GF. Throughout my GF’ss childhood, Joann's behavior was very erratic. Joann would often ""snap"" out of nowhere and lose her temper. Joann also neglected many of her parental duties when she was raising my GF and would leave for months at a time without warning. Joann's behavior has remained erratic and Joann often gets in screaming matches over the phone with my GF.

It's unclear what portion of Joann's behavior resulted from her TBI (my GF wasn't born when the TBI occurred). It's my understanding that certain TBI's can cause erratic behavior and sudden mood swings, like Joann suffers from. Additionally, when I've talked with my GF about Joann's behavior, my GF says that Joann still suffers side effects from the TBI. My GF believes that Joann can't help but act like this because of her TBI, and my GF wants to have a close relationship with her. The two of them are in a good spot now, but Joann still has severe mood swings and often yells at my GF.

Unfortunately for me, Joann has decided that I don't love my GF. Before I even met Joann, Joann would tell my GF that Joann ""just had this feeling"" that I didn't love my GF- like a premonition of sorts. I love my GF so much, and I have desperately tried to convince Joann that I love my GF. It also might be worth noting that Joann hasn't liked any of my GF's previous boyfriends or any of Joann's male friends.

I hoped that with time Joann would stop trying to convince my GF that I don't love her. But Joann's behavior has spiraled even further and now she's lying and making up situations to convince my GF that I don't like her.  

Anyways I'm tired of Joann's antics and I feel like I need to set some boundaries. I want to say that I won't go visit Joann until her behavior improves. However, I'm worried that doing so would be an awful thing for me to do because Joann may not be able to help her behavior if her behavior is due to her TBI. I want to be respectful of Joann and any potential mental illness that may be the result of a TBI, but also protect myself from her disrespectful behavior.

Until, I went to go find my childhood journals in my father’s room, where I found a sketch on me folded behind a block of my journals. When I opened this folded sketch I was excited, until, I saw it was me… naked.

I wrote creep on the paper and placed it on my father’s desk and just left. He came to me later to tell me that “it is shocking that you would ever think it’s you” and tried to overly gaslight me.

I've always been supportive through the ups and downs, and luckily, her business is finally thiving and expanding. With more growth, she finds herself busier and busier and seems to have less and less time for us. I message her often as I'm so used to showering her with love and genuinely trying to know about her day and her in general. But after her long work days, she arrives super late at home, we don't get to talk much more than 2 to 4 messages per day. Conversations seem non existent or often lead to talking to myself as I continue to send messages and check on her. She usually has an excuse to never take my calls to which she pushes to the next day and so forth, and calls between us never seems to happen anymore. I often feel like I'm begging.

During our last official conversation, she was feeling down and I tried my best to be there for her. I knew she was feeling low due to a few problems, so I did send message after message to try to help out and raise her spirits. I sent about 12 back to back with no response from her. It was of no help and she ended up screaming at me to leave her alone. I suffer from depression, so being there for emotional support when I myself am super low is hard on me, but I love her and always put her before me. But getting yelled at for caring destroyed me. So I did as she asked and left. She messaged me 3 weeks later asking if we could talk. I accepted under the condition that it'd be through call. She was okay with it, but that day, the call never came. The next day, she accused me of being angry to which I responded, call me if you want to talk. She did not. Today she finally said that she no longer wants to. 

Am I the asshole for spamming her with messages? For requesting to talk only via call? Perhaps for not understanding that people need alone time? I know that if it were me, even when I'm down I am happy to have someone with me. So I try to be there for her. But idk.

Which it was very hard to adjust, I was shy for 2 and a half years before I actually started opening up more, which gave me a ton of friends and even a girlfriend. I moved at the beginning of sixth grade and am in eleventh now. Anyway with that in mind let's move on 




So currently I live in the middle of California, Modesto specifically. My parents have been wanting to move up north to near where my uncle and some of my cousins live in the mountains which is near the border of Oregon, 200 miles away. So I was fine with this because from what it sounded like they were gonna do this after I move out and was already an adult. I mean sure it would suck that they lived so far but if they were happy up there I wasn't gonna stop them.



So the other day they pull me into their room to talk. I asked them what's up and they tell me the news that they found a good deal on a house up there and we are planning on moving up there sometime next year. I immediately freak out and tell them that I don't wanna move but they say it would be nice to start a new life. This is what went down


""It would be nice to start a new life ya know? New friends, new house, all of that""



""Yeah, well we did start a new life, 5 years ago. And I'm enjoying that life and don't want to give it up""


""Too late now, the house is already bought, besides you could just make new friends like you did here""


""It took me 3 years to become more social and get used to this, in 3 years I'll already be graduated!""


Well there could've been more stuff there, it was a few days ago after all, and then yeah the argument goes on for a bit then I storm out before yelling that that's bullshit. Also the place I moved from before was only 30 miles away and that was hard, this place is over 200 miles away.


My dad says that a new life up there could be great and I'm being ungrateful since I haven't even seen the house yet. I yell at him that he didn't even ask me first what I thought and he told me that I thought I'd like it since I like visiting my family up there, I like it but it's not a place I'd like to live, I'm more into regular town living, not a mountain town with like only 1000 people. 



So yeah there has been a ton of arguing and my parents keep saying I'm ungrateful since they bought a new house and I hate it when I never even seen the place. So am I really being ungrateful? Since you know, I've just started living my best life after getting used to it here, with a ton of friends, a good youth group, a girlfriend.

The next day we had a cool conversation and we agreed to stay friends, what low key gave me hope because well I lost my v card to her and she said that she had a great time. I kept telling myself to move on and so I did.

I'm turning 20. And every year, I order in and have a few friends over for a lowkey night. But this year, I decided to go all out because I was feeling like it. I made a reservation at a nice little restaurant, got a stunning new dress and a pair of thigh high boots. I have never worn high boots, but have always wanted to. I saved up for them for quite some time, and finally got them. 

Now, I usually turn to my friends for fashion advice. One of my friends, Amy, had her mind fixed on her opinion. Amy didn't quite like the boots, and said they were cute but wouldn't go with the dress I had bought. This was odd, because the rest of my group thought they would go perfectly. I decided to disregard her opinion and got the boots anyway. A couple days pass by, and I get a message from Amy saying that she now owns the exact SAME pair of boots as me because her mom decided to buy them for her. I was obviously confused, but she said that her mom knew she loved high boots so she decided to get them for her. I didn't believe this, but I let it pass.  Then she goes on to tell me that she's planning to wear them to my party. I laughed and told her that I was planning on wearing mine, so she should wear something different for the day. Amy brushed that off and said the boots didn't go with my dress, and that I didn't even know if I was gonna wear the dress I had ordered (it hasn't come in yet, and I tend to have fitting issues, especially at the hips) so I should not count on being able to wear them. This pissed me off, and I told her that I'd ordered the dress one size bigger than I require so the fitting wouldn't be an issue and that I was definitely wearing the boots to my party. 

Amy then asked me if I had an issue with her owning the same pair of boots as me, and accused me of having internalised misogyny. I told her that I didn't care if she owned the same stuff as me, but I just didn't want her to wear them to my party. However, she's now decided that I'm an asshole because I can't stand any girl having the same things as me, and I'm sick of this argument.

When I was around 13-16 years old my dad who was 35 or so at the time made me pee in medical containers for months for his drug tests at his doctor's appointments.
Now, l understand how fucking insane that is. Even when I was a young teen, did I understood how crazy it was? Yes, but it was my dad, and I was more or less a child. If we went to jail, that would've crushed me. 
Now, don't go hating on my dad on this post. He was and still is addicted to 'hardcore' drugs, and I don't want to hear it. You can hate on my dad for what I'm about to tell you though, because honestly, I'm still appalled, and I'm 20. 
When I got fed up one morning before school I told my dad ""I'm on my period, I can't"" and for the first time I said that, I was telling the truth and he got pissed saying that I ""should have told him before hand."" 
I'm sorry that I didn't know I was getting my period???? I didn't know that was something my body tells me the night before! My bad!
Anyways, for the next few months after that I gave him that same excuse every time and eventually he found out I was lying and yelled at me that his doctor took him off Xanax and that I was my fault. 
Sure, I guess it technically 'was' my fault because I didn't 'help him out', but I still feel like shit over it all these years? 
Oh I should say this before anyone was wondering, my dad doesn't need painkillers/Xanax. I can tell you right now for a fact that my dad is (albeit a drug addict) more or less healthy 41 year old now. He can whoop my ass as if he was still in his thirties. He wanted the drugs from his doctor because he was addicted to them, end of story.
I want to reiterate I absolutely do 'not' want to hear anyone hating on my dad about his addiction. He's been doing better, trust me, but addiction is a bitch, especially in my family. I just wanted to vent this out and such.  
I still feel so fucking guilty, I love my dad and I know he loves me but god, the hatred in his eye when he yelled at my all those years ago still fucking haunts me.

This meant that my partner was not invited to the dinner and I suggested she meet us afterwards at the bar as dinner was only going to go for an hour. My friend suggested she come to the bar afterwards too.

I know it is normal to invite your friends partners regardless, but he had booked a place with limited seats and after I asked for her to be invited he let me know there was no more space. I didn't think this was a big deal, but my partner did. Instead of meeting us at the bar afterwards, she cancelled and was crying on the phone about the situation - I talked to her on the phone but didn't want to cancel on my closest friends entire bday because my partner was, in my eyes, being unreasonable. I went to my friends bday and that was that.

The next day, she was absolutely livid at me for going. She called me an asshole, and then she said she was going to h\*rt herself if our relationship ended. I went over to her house to cool down the situation, but she slammed the door in my face twice, and then after being let inside, she proceeded to shout at me about why I was terrible for the next 45 minutes. She told me it is disrepectful to not be invited, and that I was not a 'real man', instead I was a 'little boy' and it's no wonder she never wants to have sex with me. She also said if I don't 'fix' this situation, that she was going to send my friend 'abusive messages' as some kind of threat. She was also banging on the floor with her fists.

I know I might be a little bit of an asshole for not immediately consoling my partner, but she was being unreasonable and I was honestly a bit sick of always tending to her mental health needs.

Over the course of our relationship I have slowly started to hate his dad for a multitude of reasons but the two main issues are:

1. He breeds dogs and doesn’t treat them like living beings. He sells puppies to make money(which I get they need money but there is hundreds of ways to make money without hurting animals) and he buys dogs all the time bc he sees them as decor for the house or as a flex of wealth. They currently own about 15 outside dogs all of which live in 2ft by 5ft dog runs each containing about 3 dogs each. There are also 3 more dogs that live inside. None of the dogs are trained or walked or played with. His dad takes no responsibility for any of these dogs. He buys these dogs randomly as gifts for his wife without asking if anyone wants or will take care of it. His dad also forces my boyfriend to help him artificially inseminate the dogs to get puppies which my boyfriend absolutely hates doing bc me and him see it as animal cruelty.

The reason I want to know if I’m the asshole is bc recently I was at my bf’s house when he told me to wait in his room bc his dad had to talk to him about something personal(his dad told him to say this bc his dad didn’t want me to know) and his sister came upstairs and waited with me(also bc their dad told her to). I waited for a long time until I just went downstairs to see what was happening and I walked in on my bf holding a dog while his dad was artificially inseminating the dog with his bare hands and I was so disgusted I just walked out after his dad saw me. 

By the end of the night, my bf tells me to go shake his dads hand(his dad told him to ask me) which brings me to another reason I don’t like his dad

2. His dad asks me why I don’t come over more every single time I come over which is often. I always respond with I’m busy or my bf has been working all week. he’s also a little creepy about it. He’s not saying it in a way like he wants the family to see me more often-bc I then I wouldn’t have a problem with it.  He also constantly asks my bf why I don’t shake his hand or hug him when I come over(“his” as in my boyfriend’s dad). To me this is a weird thing to complain ab bc I’ve never heard of it, but to him it’s a way to show respect. I have a big issue with being touched especially by men bc of childhood issues. My bf would make this clear every time his dad asked why, yet his dad still wants to me to hug and shake his hand.

When he asked ME why I don’t shake his hand that same day, I said I don’t like being touched. And he looked sad about it, but I just walked away.

I especially didn’t wanna suck it up and do it bc I just watched him finger a dog a half hour before this…

We’re decent enough friends but mostly hangout with her fiancé and my husband in a group. We both have few friends so I felt a bit guilty and ended up going, even though I’m not a huge partier and had never met anyone else going.

The group ended up being kind of cliquey. It was 5 of us, but they sort of paired off 2 and 2 and I was alone for most of it. I tried my best to talk to them but they were very non responsive, one word answers, etc. They stuck me on the pull out couch since there weren’t enough beds, despite paying the same, and the bride just watched this happen. They made little comments about my clothes, were sarcastic about things I said, etc. Nothing super obvious but slightly mean girl vibes. I also got stuck with the bill like 75% of the time and just paid it. Plus, we spent most of the time at bars with music I didn’t know (it was all techno) so while I tried to play along I was definitely out of place.

I tried my best to keep a smile on but I feel like I might not have been as - happy - as I should have been? Like I definitely tried to fake it for the bride but it was 4 nights and they might have noticed I was tired. After, the bride told her fiancé, who told my husband, that I must not have had a lot of fun, and my husband said I should have tried harder to have fun or at least pretend.

I picked a drone and got into my group of four, and there were problems.

Part of the project was to create a presentation on our chosen topic. But before that, communication between group members was poor, and I tended to contribute more to the project than other group members. Each group member committed to different parts of the presentation for this presentation. One person also committed to bringing visual aids.

I assembled my part of the presentation at the last minute. However, the other group members still needed to write their parts. My messages regarding the project went ignored. I completed the entire presentation that night, not just my part, and went to bed. I overslept because I was tired and was two hours late for class. My group presented without me.

Angry that I had to spend six hours without my teammates contributing to the project. I voiced my displeasure to my professor, who hosted a group discussion on these issues the following week.

In that discussion, I discussed my displeasure with other group members' lack of communication and contributions to the presentation. I also wondered why they edited my presentation to cut out content I deemed essential.

The next one to speak was absent for a few weeks. He was absent because of a disease outbreak in his family, so he stayed home and remained radio silent. I asked him why he never communicated with my professor or the group. He said he didn't want to share that there was a viral disease outbreak in his home.

The third person explained altering the slideshow by saying she changed the presentation to accommodate her visual aids. She abandoned our previous plan to get a shadow box with the parts and brought her drone. And did not notify the group of her change in plans. Regarding the lack of communication, she stated that something happened that she didn't feel like she wanted to share or say something about how something was going on. She also stated that she had communicated with other group members, including one absent member.

It devolved into a discussion where I pointed out that in the project, we are stuck in the same boat and need to rely on each other to get a good grade. By not communicating or contributing to the overall output of the project, we were jeopardizing our education. 

In response, she also said that nobody had asked me to stay up and complete the assignment. Therefore, it wasn't their problem. I decided to cut and run. I determined the situation wouldn't get better when it returned to being my turn. I told the table I quit and went solo.

My professor commented, saying I had certain tendencies that don't acclimate me to group work. The professor's assistant said the group members were just content with how the leaves were falling. And my group members' reactions to me indicate they see me as wrong regarding my concerns.

We have been friends since high school and up until last year, I never wanted anything more than to get a break from him. Backstory: I lost my parent in highschool and had to deal with the grief alone.

About a year and a half ago, a friend of mine lost a close relative and then lost one of his parents within days of each other. He looked to me to talk about this only because I knew what he had gone through. By this time, it had been years since my loss and we had different styles of handling it. I stayed home because leaving the house, in my mind, was selfish of me and my friend makes plans with anyone to avoid not being home.

I really wanted to be there for him and I tried but work and transferring to another college were my priorities. I told him numerous times both my parents wanted me to be a college graduate so school was a priority and saving money was too. In the beginning he was calling me every single day but I worked my job almost 6 days a week for being part-time then went home to do homework.

I told him numerous times I was tired and didn’t feel like FaceTiming. He knows I don’t like FaceTime either yet still called me a lot. His other group of friends didn’t even try in the beginning to console him and made excuses for not seeing him yet would post that they were with each other. This group just had to pick one struggle, either be stupid enough to post that you were out or not help their friend with his losses, they picked both.

I may be TA for not hanging out with him and taking his calls/texts after a few months because I was the only person he went to about this and I did care about his pain but it became too much to try and care for by myself. I wanted to be there but I felt suffocated by his grief while still dealing with my own.

He told our friends that he felt like I was able to handle everything considering what I went through but now he just feels abandoned and doesn’t expect much from me. I feel like he took my words so personally that I felt I couldn't say anything anymore. Our friends wanted to help him but he didn’t even try to reach out to them until after I left for college. Now this burden is on my best friend.

There are a lot more details I could include but I am limited with words so let’s skip ahead in a time. I transferred to an amazing university and me and this guy rarely talk anymore because he knows now apparently that I am extremely busy with clubs, school, and jobs.

The problem still is his attitude towards me still. It’s resentful and he plays the victim any time I sarcastically make a comment at him. He sees playful jabs as personal attacks but it’s worse when it comes from me. I went back to counseling recently since I couldn’t deal with every emotion he had and being away made me reflect on how shitty he has been. College is difficult without my parent here to see how far I have come. I felt alone in dealing with his emotions and it became too much to bare, So I want to know AITA?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4829171,public,top,self,AITA for wanting a break from my friend and his grief?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5tra0/aita_for_wanting_a_break_from_my_friend_and_his/,all_ads,6,

I (21 M), was previously best friends with we'll call Adam (also 21m). We have been friends since middle school and there's been lots of disagreements between us, but not one as serious as this. Adam was moving for his trade school and it was a 7 hour drive from where we live currently, and his dad was going to drive him. He had everything planned, but all of a sudden he hears that his dad may have cancer and needed to have an emergency surgery, meaning he wouldn't be able to drive him anymore. Being his best friend, he asked me to drive in his dad's place. I was open to the idea since this city is somewhere I always wanted to go anyways, so I agreed on the spot.

Fast forward a couple days later, I wanted to talk details with Adam to see how everything would plan out. I'm currently in a trade school online, and as embarrassing as it is to admit, I really didn't have the funds to drive 14 hours total while covering expenses like food, and housing. Adam knew I didn't have that kind of money, and he did offer to pay for gas the way there, which was a given for me. Like I said before, I've never been to this city before, nor have I driven that far in my life. After giving it some more thought, I had composed a text asking politely if his dad could pay for the minimum expenses like housing for 1 night, and my gas. I wasn't asking for a 5 star hotel, I just wanted somewhere to rest up and leave the next morning because I didn't feel comfortable driving that much in one day. To my surprise, he didn't take that text very well and started calling me entitled for asking that. He said that he didn't want to ask his dad for money since his family was in distress due to the possibility he might have cancer, and that his dad's friend offered to do it for free beforehand.

Before I go on, I want to mention that Adam's family was more than well off, and Adam had just received around 6,000 dollars as spending money from his dad, he's on his dad's credit card, meaning he really didn't NEED to ask for that money in the first place. He gets refills all the time.

Back to the story! After reading his response, I immediately told him that he should have his dad's friend drive him there because it would be easier on both sides. I thought that was the end of it but he proceeded to try and guilt trip me saying things like ""I thought you were my bestfriend"" and ""I thought I could count on you for this"". Which really made me mad. We had always been great friends and were often selfless towards one another, but this situation put me in a tough spot. Hearing that really left a big impression, and I didn't want to be friends with Adam anymore.

Around 2 weeks after this happened, Adam’s other close friend, who we’ll call Bob, asked me to hangout and play tennis. I found the text weird considering we also haven’t spoken ever since Adam and I stopped talking. Basically, he told me that Adam’s dad had a false scare, and that Adam ended up driving there himself…",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4829167,public,top,self,AITA for not driving 14 hours in one day to help my friend move?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5tqvg/aita_for_not_driving_14_hours_in_one_day_to_help/,all_ads,6,

I (23F) and my boyfriend (25M) am at a standstill and need to know who might be the one in the wrong. 

So here’s the situation. I’m a Christmas baby and on top of that I’m hard to shop for, my wants range from a new fancy shower curtain to hiking gear. Of course I’m appreciative for every present I’ve received but me and my boyfriend agreed that it’s easier if I just let him know what I want. I also know that due to my birthday being so close to Christmas that I get combined gifts, that’s not an issue either. 

However, today when I was on the phone with my boyfriend today I was detailing some things I want and he proceeded to call me spoiled. I’m not asking him to break the bank, everything is reasonably priced. We joked about it in the moment but I realized that what he said didn’t make me feel good. 

Some context, we couldn’t really adequately celebrate my day due to the “big scare” last year. I also always go all out for our celebrations (cake, balloons, personalized gifts, a card). When I brought this up in rebuttal to being called spoiled the next day, I was told I didn’t have to do that. 

I think I might be the asshole because it does sound somewhat spoiled to detail out presents I want. In addition, I did double down on my position when I told him that I always do my best to celebrate and appreciate him on other holidays.

Which it was very hard to adjust, I was shy for 2 and a half years before I actually started opening up more, which gave me a ton of friends and even a girlfriend. I moved at the beginning of sixth grade and am in eleventh now. Anyway with that in mind let's move on 




So currently I live in the middle of California, Modesto specifically. My parents have been wanting to move up north to near where my uncle and some of my cousins live in the mountains which is near the border of Oregon, 200 miles away. So I was fine with this because from what it sounded like they were gonna do this after I move out and was already an adult. I mean sure it would suck that they lived so far but if they were happy up there I wasn't gonna stop them.



So the other day they pull me into their room to talk. I asked them what's up and they tell me the news that they found a good deal on a house up there and we are planning on moving up there sometime next year. I immediately freak out and tell them that I don't wanna move but they say it would be nice to start a new life. This is what went down


""It would be nice to start a new life ya know? New friends, new house, all of that""



""Yeah, well we did start a new life, 5 years ago. And I'm enjoying that life and don't want to give it up""


""Too late now, the house is already bought, besides you could just make new friends like you did here""


""It took me 3 years to become more social and get used to this, in 3 years I'll already be graduated!""


Well there could've been more stuff there, it was a few days ago after all, and then yeah the argument goes on for a bit then I storm out before yelling that that's bullshit. Also the place I moved from before was only 30 miles away and that was hard, this place is over 200 miles away.


My dad says that a new life up there could be great and I'm being ungrateful since I haven't even seen the house yet. I yell at him that he didn't even ask me first what I thought and he told me that I thought I'd like it since I like visiting my family up there, I like it but it's not a place I'd like to live, I'm more into regular town living, not a mountain town with like only 1000 people. 



So yeah there has been a ton of arguing and my parents keep saying I'm ungrateful since they bought a new house and I hate it when I never even seen the place. So am I really being ungrateful?

We live in a cul de sac and our friend pulled up in our driveway as she thought she was going to drive us. Her car was parked behind my car. My car was in our car port (which holds 2 cars side by side) while hers, being behind, was in the shared driveway area.
We told our friend to move her car to the empty space in our carport as we were taking my partner's car. We left and forgot to move the car into the empty space.
We got back from our trip and immediately our neighbour ""Penny"" (F~60?) came out of her house. She said that by leaving our friend's car there she wasn't able to get to an appointment she had.
I apologised for causing her to miss her appointment and asked her why she wasn't able to reverse her car out as there was ample space to do that.
Penny said she has an old car that doesn't have a good turning circle (2007 ford fiesta hatchback). 
I again apologised and asked why she wasn't able to drive her car into our car port and reverse out. (She has no issues driving up into our car port when no cars are there to back her car into her car port.)
Penny then screamed at us for parking there and causing her to miss her appointment. 
I apologised again and asked if she would like us to move the car right now?
Penny then sarcastically said ""Yes that would be great""
Penny then stormed off and slammed her front door shut.

We were pretty taken aback as we've only ever had pleasant interactions with her. She's even given us a bouquet of flowers from her garden. I don't want this to turn into anything bad as we only bought our house a few months ago. Id prefer to stay friendly with my neighbour, for obvious reasons.

Penny had enough space to drive out of her spot and reverse out, she just didn't have the option of being able turn her car around in the driveway.
The driveway is wide enough for two cars to get through.

My partner and I think because she's a bit older that's why she couldn't reverse out or had a lot of trouble with it. 
I'm thinking of putting my ego aside and writing Penny an apology letter but my partner wants to forget about it and make sure no one parks there in future.

Me and my other two best friends, Mike and Steven, were planning this event to include anywhere from 4 - 6 other people.

For some context, Mike, Steven, and I are very good friends, and I am pretty close with most of their friends, so we decided to invite three of our mutual friends along for a total of 6 people. I wanted to invite some more seeing as we had space, but we all decided against it after further consideration because most of my other friends are not super close with Mike and Steven's friends. In particular, one of my best friends, whom I'll call John, doesn't really know all of them that well. We're a part of large friend group, and we've all hung out before, but he's never gone out with any of them before on any activity outside of school. He tries to get closer to them, but they don't have a lot in common.  So, we decided to not invite him. 

After the party was over, some people posted pictures on insta, snap, bereal, whatever social media app they wanted to, and John found out. He didn't really approach me about it, but I can tell that he was hurt by it because he got kinda cold when other people brought it up. After thinking about it a little, I suppose that if I invited him, he might have gotten to know them all better in that enclosed setting, and we all could have hung out more in the future. On the other hand though, I don't know if he would have even had fun at a party where we would be talking about things of no interest to him, and likely doing things that he wouldn't agree with (Like watching horror movies).

I know its such a small, stupid non-issue, but I feel really bad about it and just want to get some judgement to know whether I screwed up or not.

There's a major possibility she's pregnant with my kid. Blood test to confirm if she is pregnant. But, we recently got into a spirited conversation over the effort. We are in a group chat with her best friend, but my gf blatantly ignored me telling her I loved her 3 separate times. Read it and didn't say it back, which she knows is a pet peeve of mine. Words of affirmation is my love language.

I promised her I'd never treat her the way her ex did. I wouldn't yell or call her names or get drunk and lose my temper/fight. 

I ended up being abusive for a while. I deeply regret it. She wants me to fix it by going to anger management and I haven't found a class yet. I go to therapy sometimes now. I quit drinking, and I've been sleeping on a crappy mattress in our spare bedroom for 3 months. Things haven't gotten much better. She's angry and says I'm not doing enough because I still haven't gotten my anger completely under control, gone to an anger management class, and we argue a lot now. 

Today, I told her that I decided that I want to move to Washington. She is furious and says I used her and lied. I would want her to be happy if she decided to move. I would want her to do what she wants to do to be happy. She says I'm a jerk for making all these promises, breaking all of them and then breaking the biggest one (not doing everything within my power to make this relationship work).

My husband brought up that his friend wanted to come to our vacation city to visit for New Years and could just stay with us. I asked why he would come visit us and not plan to visit his wife during the holiday and he didn’t give an answer. 

A few details to consider. 
-My husband never takes vacation so this is rare to have holiday time as a family.
-The place we are staying is only two bedrooms, one for us and the other for our kids. His parents even talked about staying with us while they are there.  
-I’m a very passive and selfless person and tend to get taken advantage of, which can end up making me very upset. 
-My husband is a very extroverted person and we are working on selfishness with him. He isn’t a bad person, just a bit selfish.

For this  weekend, I finally relented and said he is welcome in my house (he has been in rehab and attending AA meetings.) Now since I live in a legal marijuana state I told both he and my sister that he can smoke/ingest any weed that he wants, but absolutely no drinking.

Today, after he ate an entire tin of edibles (again I don’t care about this) he drank an entire fifth of rum and a pint of whisky and the better part of a small bottle of vodka. Probably in total of a liter of liquor.

So here is where I may be the AH, I kicked him out of my house and told him if he steps foot on my property I would have him arrested for trespassing. My sister is upset with me but understands where my headspace is.

2. I like dogs 
3. I’m there literally every other week.

this pissed me off and I thought about stealing it, but didn’t want to make her mad. Yesterday though, I was her putting stuff in the dryer and lo and behold, my blanket! I wait until the dryer goes off and take it back. I put it at the bottom of my covers this time. she of course noticed and questioned me, I just told her to leave me alone and that it was mine. She told her son, who at this point was crying for the blanket that I stole it, (even though it wasn’t his in the first place) and he lost it. Because of this she decided to spank me. Spank me. It didn’t hurt, I didn’t cry, it just pissed me off.

Throwaway account, don’t want friends, family and colleagues to see this.

I (M26), am a very insecure guy and hate being seen differently as any other person. I absolutely love my boyfriend (M26, now ex) but I’m just too scared to be seen dating someone of the same gender. My friends and family have met my ex countless times, but don’t suspect us dating, mainly because I’ve made sure to make it clear that him and I are just friends. Every time we’re out in public, I make it seem like we’re friends, but when we’re alone, we’re extremely intimate. I know all this pisses him off because he wants the world to know that we’re a happy couple, regardless of what people think, but I CARE about what people think, so that’s the main thing that’s putting a strain on our relationship. Lately, we’ve had a huge argument regarding all of this and at the end of the argument, my ex gave me 2 options. I either accept myself and accept this relationship without having to worry about anyone’s opinions or we break up. Honestly, I was so sick and tired of living in constant fear around everybody, so I just left him. 

I genuinely regret leaving him, I love him so much but I’m not good enough for him. If I had the confidence to do so, I would run back to him and start over.
I honestly hope he finds someone who’s brave enough to publicly show their love for one another.

She said she's happy I told her because she would have hated me for knowing and not saying anything. But I still feel so guilty and I want to be there for her but it feels wrong. Like I helped him break her heart.

Her name is Mi-rae. I have been forced to look after Mi-rae every now and then, and she's basically just a spoiled brat who spends most of her time crying and whining. She is colourblind and can't see the colour green, so sometimes when she really pisses me off, I pull up a picture of a cauliflower or a broccoli on my phone and make her guess what it is. If she answers incorrectly, then I would lock her in her bedroom until I'm done babysitting for the night. And sometimes, when she gets really upset, she starts speaking in her native Korean, so I would tease her by yelling ""blah blah blah"" at her; I get pissed when people don't speak English in Canada. Keep in mind that I am dealing with my own trauma these days, and it's no wonder that I'm always in a bad mood.

Mi-rae must have told someone about all this, because my entire family, as well as my brother's girlfriend and her family, are pissed off at me. My father spent hours one night just yelling at me nonstop, and I am no longer allowed at some family gatherings. My brother told me that if I kept my behaviour up around Mi-rae, then I would no longer be his brother. My mother and I used to text each other daily, but nowadays she's gone no-contact. It's as if I've been disowned, and it stings.

We have been friends since high school and up until last year, I never wanted anything more than to get a break from him. Backstory: I lost my parent in highschool and had to deal with the grief alone.

About a year and a half ago, a friend of mine lost a close relative and then lost one of his parents within days of each other. He looked to me to talk about this only because I knew what he had gone through. By this time, it had been years since my loss and we had different styles of handling it. I stayed home because leaving the house, in my mind, was selfish of me and my friend makes plans with anyone to avoid not being home.

I really wanted to be there for him and I tried but work and transferring to another college were my priorities. I told him numerous times both my parents wanted me to be a college graduate so school was a priority and saving money was too. In the beginning he was calling me every single day but I worked my job almost 6 days a week for being part-time then went home to do homework.

I told him numerous times I was tired and didn’t feel like FaceTiming. He knows I don’t like FaceTime either yet still called me a lot. His other group of friends didn’t even try in the beginning to console him and made excuses for not seeing him yet would post that they were with each other. This group just had to pick one struggle, either be stupid enough to post that you were out or not help their friend with his losses, they picked both.

He’s been upset with me a lot this year and was trying to act as if he’s my parent. He kept telling me to take breaks from school and work but I simply ignored him with the promise I had made to my parent to succeed in life. 

This last year he has been nothing but a bother to me with his shit talking behind my back to our friends about how he feels abandoned by me because he’s clearly not that important to me. He took my words so personally that I felt I couldn't say anything to him anymore. Our friend group is so supportive, he could have gone to anyone else other than me about his grief which he doesn’t even acknowledge anymore yet it is clear he still is affected by it.

There are a lot more details I could include but I am limited with words so let’s skip ahead in a time. I transferred to an amazing university and me and this guy rarely talk anymore because he knows now apparently that I am extremely busy with clubs, school, and jobs.

The problem still is his attitude towards me still. It’s resentful and he plays the victim any time I sarcastically make a comment at him. He sees playful jabs as personal attacks but it’s worse when it comes from me. I went back to counseling recently because I couldn’t deal with every emotion he had and being away from him made me reflect on how shitty he has made me feel. College is difficult without my parent here to see how far I have come and I felt alone in dealing with his emotions and it became too much to bare, So I want to know AITA?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4829101,public,top,self,AITA for wanting a break from my friend and his grief?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5t7bj/aita_for_wanting_a_break_from_my_friend_and_his/,all_ads,6,

I had invited my friend/roomate we'll call her Allie since her family is in a different country. For a little background my mom has been divorced twice and me and my sister 16 F barley remember our father as he left as when I was three and she was a newborn. So our mother had a tendency to get married quickly to assholes like our current step dad. As me and Allie come to my mom's house me and my sister we'll call her Sarah start catching up. Once everyone had showed up me and my sister had to greet lots of people including the new step dad as I had only met him a few times. I didn't think he was all that nice but he didn't seem intolerable. After a few quick conversations we had to get seated to start eating. As me Allie and Sarah sat down beside each other I noticed my step dad looking kind of suspiciously at sarah. I sort of brushed it off but it seemed he wasn't stopping. Sarah had excused herself to use the restroom after a minute or so step dad got up and left the table. I wasn't too fond of that so I got up hastily to follow him. Turns out for a while he had been making moves on Sarah and getting too close for comfort.  I had just witnessed this happen while everyone else was downstairs so my Instinct was to grab Sarah and sart screaming. I ran down the stairs him following me and Sarah, yelling for us to stop. It was clear Sarah was uncomfortable and I had just exposed step dad to the whole family about his innapropriate behavior twords her.

My (17f) bf (19m) and I have an amazing relationship. The one source of conflict in our relationship is this girl Ariel(20f). She has known him for a long time, and also had kind of a rough past. She helped him in his faith journey, and I am very grateful for that. However, she has a HUGE thing for him and has for a long time.

Their whole friend group doesn't like her because she is extremely petty and rude. She asked to have lunch with me once and said she ""didn't even think I was that pretty,"" and ""didn't understand why guys were fighting over me."" I told my bf and he stopped talking to her after that, and hasn't texted her for months. (They had been growing apart.) But-he consistently defends her and says I ""only met her once"" (I've been at gatherings with her) and I ""don't know her like him.""

He went to her party and I was prepared not to hear from him. An hour later he texts me""I swear, I'm ab to leave.she is so passive-aggressive it's on a whole new level."" I was instantly annoyed. I always say that she is rude and passive-aggressive, and he defends her. And now he's shocked? I don't think so. but I text back 3 separate times to ask if he is okay and if she is saying mean things to him. No answer for a long time.

The next thing I get from him is a picture of alcohol that says ""this makes it better."" I told him that it made me upset that he was drinking. he asked if I was mad. He calls me a few mins later and asks ""do we have a problem?"" after the normal hi-hello deal. Apparently, my friend texted him and told him to get his shit tgthr. I appreciated this but he took it to heart and thought I had been shit-talking him for weeks.

I explained I was upset that he didn't answer my texts after texting me he was uncomfortable,which made me worried about him. he said he just ""started having fun"" but apologized. Next, I told him I was upset that he was drinking(he denied ever hearing me say that i was uncomfortable with it.) Now, ill admit I didn't say it directly as in ""don't drink"" but I did say ""I don't know about that..."" when he told me. What hurt more was how adamant he was that I didn't say it and there was no room for discussion. He also brought up how I ""constantly beat down on her""and how he just""plays along to make me feel better."" and how I am too mean to her (whatever i say is only to him.)

Next, I said I was upset that he repeatedly defends her but surprised when she hasn't changed. He said that I've only met her once, asked what my problem is with her (didn't even know where to start there,) and the grand finale: I have no right to be mad. I understand some of what he is upset about, like what my friend said to him, and how the drinking could have been misinterpreted, but the rest of it I don't. He said that he wasnt ""getting drunk,"" he was just ""drinking."" it was not progressive so we decided to hang up and revisit tmrw.

First of all, English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes!!
Ok so
This girl and i since the beginning had some kind of little fights, not face to face but i didn't liked her very much, but after i figured out that she knew that i didn't liked her very much, i thought ""hey, why dont we like her? I mean, she's nice! Everyone likes her"" and then proceed to try and do different things with my behavior to show that I did like her
That was fine! We begin to be ok, she even invited me for a party and stuff
Then the day happened 
My professor was shocked about how bad our class did on a big test we had, the biggest grade was not over like three
I went to talk with him and see what was going on, checked if the test he was correcting was the same that we had done and unfortunately it was
So he showed me everyone's grades
And told me that the only person who wasnt gonna need to do a recovery test is a boy who almost no one likes, aand she, the girl from the beginning 
But there was a problem
She was only going to be ok because he would give her some extra points, cause her grade was almost enough to pass
Okay
He tells me to tell the others, and  i do
Told her about the professor giving her some extra points and she looked at me like I was crazy and say ""why? Cause ive corrected it and i got all the answers right I wouldn't need extra"" i respond "" well you didnt got it all right"" she goes ""yes I did!"" And then people come to me and ask who was going to need the recovery test and i said ""basically everyone"" they said ""even her?"" (Reffering to the girl)
""Well, the professor is giving her some extra points, so no"" 
""But she got all the answers right""
Then yeah i was starting to get a bit mad because mY GOD even if she HAD got all the answers right she would need extra points anyway because it wasnt ENOUGH
But again 
I SAW everyone's grade so I know she didn't got all right oh my god
So repeated what i said to her and then she passed over me saying ""OKAY * insert name * EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD OH MY GOD"" and me already kinda angry said "" I WAS JUST FUCKING SAYING JESUS"" and we processed to walk to different places
I noticed that i screamed and that maybe she was mad because she didn't wanted to others to know her grade ( it didnt even crossed my mind because needing extra points or not her grade was one of the best) so i went to apologize 
Said that i was sorry she answered me with:
"" I think you are very happy with my bad grade yeah?""
Well i wasn't expecting that so i got a little speechless and just could respond ""no??"" (almost with a ""what the fuck"") and she said ""well now it has passed""
 i walked away after she did it too
Now im feeling bad, a friend came to ask me what happened and i explained but im still very confused

This place is my grandmothers house that was built around 1970 and is honestly a really nice house to be able to live in. My grandfather passed away several years ago and my grandmother lives in a nursing home, so now the house sits vacant. I was asked if my girlfriend, child, and I would like to move by my mother (who is power of attorney and beneficiary of my grandmother meaning she’ll be my landlord and future owner of the house when my grandmother passes). That being said, with my grandmother being in a nursing home paid for by medicare, she can not make any money off of the house as it will affect her medicaid, so we will only be paying the cost of living/maintaining (utilities, internet, trash, etc.) and in the long run it’ll save us money by not having to pay an outrageous rent price and she won’t have to pay to maintain the house out of my grandmothers pocket. I have simply been asking to be treated as a normal tenant just like it would be if you let any joe schmoe move in. For example, I would like to switch over to the internet of my choice, we no longer need a security system for the house, and I would like to have the ring camera removed or have sole access myself for the privacy of my own family. These are just a few of the simple things I asked for since we will be the ones living there and paying the bills. There will be a lease and documentation signed etc. But everytime I try to bring these points up she wants to fight me on it and give me the “ITS MY HOUSE AND MY RULES” response when I would like to simply be treated like a normal tenant. To make it even worse, my sister works in property management and tries to tell her that I’m actually right and what I’m asking for is normal but she is just too self centered to see that this situation benefits both parties. Would I like to move in? Yes. Do I have to move in and want to deal with the toxicity of having my mother as my landlord? No. We don’t NEED this opportunity, we’re simply just accepting this offer given if things go right and if not, we are fully capable of finding our own home.

Husband and I are in our mid to late 40s. Married 15 years. I feel cheated. 

I am Asian American and was raised in America since elementary school. For Thanksgiving and Xmas, we and the kids do all the traditional and typical Christmas activities. I arrange and buy airline tickets so we visit his family every Christmas. I remember these things. 

It's not reciprocated. Come January or early February,  no one remembers Chinese New Year. The first few years I taught him some stuff. In the last 5 years, he has forgotten 3 of them until I remind him or he hears it on the news. 

I have expressed to him that it's important to me that he is dedicated and enthusiastic about the culture I come from. 

So he asked me 'What is it that you need to see me do so that this will be ok for you?'

I told him....Not this time. This one requires him to put in the work and the effort to find the info. Not for me to lay out the answers on a silver platter for him. That's the part that requires research and interest and effort.

 I think of my situation as similar to a situation where a person with white privilege asks a black person to tell them about the injustices and racist implications they have experienced. It's not the black person's job to do that. Sorry if I did not articulate that very well. 


For other times when we argue, yeah I've let him know what I needed or felt. I don't want to do it with this one.

We are sharing a studio apartment now, he is using his student loan to pay his portion of the rent, and my mom is paying my portion. 

In the summer of 2021, I lived at home with my mom and sister, and my boyfriend was staying at a friend's apartment. We were both working part-time at my family's business at this time. Eventually, his friend's apartment lease ended, and his new lease was supposed to start almost a month later. He could have temporarily moved back home (4 hours away) with his family, but he needed to work to make money to afford August rent (because his student loan doesn't disperse for the semester until after August 1st). My mom and I were okay with him staying at our house, but my sister, who was 16 then, was not. Her only reason was that he was a stranger to her, and she felt she couldn't move freely in the house if he were there. My mom and I both told her that she has never even tried to get comfortable with him or talk to him, but she doesn't care and says her friends all agree with her and that we are wrong. So, my mom was going to pay for a temporary living place for him to stay between apartment leases. She would do this both because he needed to work and make money and because she needed his help at work. When we checked him in at the temporary living place, they said he couldn't stay there alone because he was 20 at the time, not 21. Because of this, my mom and I told him to stay at our house. My sister wasn't happy but realized at that point there was no other option. We all survived those few weeks, but my sister was unhappy.

Now, my boyfriend and I will graduate from college in May 2023, and our lease ends in July 2023. My mom mentioned that my boyfriend and I could move into the house to save money after we graduate and once we are both working full-time jobs. My boyfriend and I weren't super into that idea until we realized we could save at least $20,000 in rent just by living at home for a year. We had thought we wouldn't have to worry about my sister because she graduates high school in June 2023, our lease ends at the end of July, and she would leave for college in early August. However, we have now realized that she will leave in late September because she is likely attending a UK college. 

I thought my sister would understand that we can't just get an apartment lease for two months while she's still in the house, or she would realize how much we could save by living at home. Still, instead, she is saying we should find another apartment, do long distance, move in with my grandparents instead, etc., because she doesn't want to be in the same house as my boyfriend for less than two months.

I don't want my sister to feel uncomfortable, but I think that she is acting insanely selfish and spoiled. He does not bother her at all.

They each have children ranging from middle school to high school age. While i love my sisters, they have a tendency to not show up for things in regards to our family. For example, when my boyfriend proposed to me, he picked a date when my sisters both said they were free, and they live 10 minutes down the road from me so he thought they’d for sure make it. My one sister said she was too sick to come but went to my nephews football game the night before and got photos with my other sisters family, her family, and their mom the next day. My other sister was returning from a college tour with her son and said she would try to stop by but did not end up showing up.

My boyfriend (m31) just proposed to me (m28) recently and we have decided on a fall wedding date for next year.  We chose this date because we both love the fall, and the month we chose in particular is special to us. We cant push it to a later month as we wont be able to have an outdoor ceremony (which has always been my dream). And we dont want to push it forward as we both tend to sweat a lot and I dont want to be a sweaty mess on my wedding day, and neither does he.

The date we chose though seems to be an issue for my older sisters. My oldest nephew plays football and is going to college next year, so my wedding is in the middle of his football season. I did have this in mind when I picked the date but because he has not picked his college yet and we dont know if he is even starting, I was hoping it would all work out and he could make the wedding. I do understand however that there is a chance he cant make the wedding, and while I of course want him there and would be upset he had to miss it, I would understand.

What I didn’t have in mind was that month is also homecoming month. Homecoming to me growing up was never a big deal so it was not something on my mind. My sisters mentioned homecoming and how they may have to leave my wedding early to take pictures of their kids at homecoming(implying their kids would go to homecoming over my wedding). They both want me to move my wedding date to another month that is more convenient for them.

I don’t see why I should have to move the date and I do truly believe my wedding is more important than a homecoming dance.

Mind you, I was not close to his mother, but I am close to my boyfriend of 10 years.

While on speaker phone with his entire family, after his mom passed as he was trying to get to her because she was on her last breath-- my BF asked if I wanted to go to the funeral and I said yes, but while I looked at my finances, I realized it was going to cost me just a little too much. He said he would call me that night and I agreed so I could better explain some details. I figured he would call but I ended up staying at his place to take care of his household, the dog, and clean up after him/ put stuff away at his place, for example, complete acts of service to help ease his pain when he returned and never got to speak on the phone with him as he never called.

When he texted me later that week, ""I assume you are not coming,"" I apologized but didn't tell him why because I was too embarrassed to say I couldn't afford it and this would have been over text-- my rent went up twice this year and my father's medication was rejected by his insurance and my father hasn't asked but I will cover his medication if needed.

I wanted to speak with him on the phone to explain and didn't call myself because I was so incredibly exhausted from work (we are both teachers) and cleaning (my man is messy).

I ended up sending flowers and my condolences.

When he got home, he told me he just wanted to be left alone. Then late one night he texted me that I should have been there. We finally spoke in person and I told him everything as to why I didn't go and he said that he would have paid for it and that I should have known that. By the way, I am not a mind reader.

He has asked me for space.

I've seen him a few times and he says he is doing fine but he doesn't look it. I am going to leave him alone for now because I have done everything from making dinner, to cleaning his house, to taking care of the dog, gifting him a care package with all his favorite snacks, and surprising him with a mega Thanksgiving Lunch meal of BBQ Ribs, Chicken, Fries, Rolls, Slaw, Corn, Bread Pudding, and Cream Brule along with checking in every few days or so.

A has always been kind of stuck up and mean if things don't go her way. This causes a lot of fights with us, and I usually have to be the bigger person and just accept her treatment. 

A had decided to ask me to be her Maid of honor, and N would be her Matron of honor. At this time, the company I worked for contracted my department out and I was left with no job as a single mom. I was left with a very tight budget, and I knew this was going to be an issue. A was fully aware of this.

When it came to getting dresses, A wanted us all in the same style. This would be hard because everyone else was petite while I was  tall and plus sized. Plus my budget lessened our options as well. We finally found a dress that the shop said they could order in my size, but I wouldn't know how it would look on me until it arrived. This was fine.

When the dresses finally came in weeks later, we were cutting it close to wedding time. Well, the shop got my measurements wrong, and my dress was too small. Luckily, N said she knew how to sew so she would see what she could do. She took my dress and measurements and I heard nothing else from her about it. 

I worried about not having my dress to A who told me not to worry about it, as N had it handled. I didn't get my dress back until the day of the wedding. All N had done was sew a single ribbon across the back where it was supposed to zip at the top, leaving it very obvious that it was unzipped. The ribbon was also too long, so it hung loosley across my back. This left my back, and all its folds, exposed. This made me extremely self conscious. There was a chiffon wrap that came with the dresses that I asked A if I could use to at least conceal my back a bit, even though it's fairly sheer. She rolled her eyes before telling me no, she didn't like how it looked. A acted as if this was my fault and refused to speak to me after that.

We went to take pictures, and despite being the maid of honor l was placed at the end of the lines in all the group shots, while N stood next to A. When it came to family shots, A and her fiance took pictures with our parents, then they took pictures with his parents and N. I was not asked to be in any family shots. 

When it was time to walk down the aisle, our line up had been changed and I was once again as far away as possible from A while N stood at her side. At the reception when I was giving my speech. The whole time I was speaking she didn't pay any attention and was speaking to people near her. I felt awful that A would shut me out on such an important day. I understood it sucked to have things go wrong on your wedding day, but I don't feel that it warranted my treatment.

After the wedding, I went home and called my mom to vent to her she said I was being dramatic.

My husband (36M) and I (37M) have two twin boys (4M), I also have another child from a different relationship but he’s not relevant to this issue. My husband Is a great parent, he even gave up a lot of his work to raise the kids because his biggest dream was to be a “husband and a father” (his words) he would happily become stay-at-home dad but he still loves his independence and his job so he just reduced the number of projects he participates in. 

My husband’s parenting is amazing, he is a well-read man regarding parenting and how to navigate through it, My husband and I were both raised the old way (which means h\*tt\*ng a child as a punishment so “they learn”)but my husband has changed all of that, when our kids have a tantrum (like two days ago, they were angry because we didn’t invite them to our wedding) my husband offers them emotional support, validates their feelings, offer them options and also help them solve their problems, he doesn’t solve the problems himself but still helps the kids to it themselves though. I learn a lot from him, one day I tried to stop a tantrum the old way but he stopped me. One thing I love about his parenting is that when my kids mess up, break something, etc. they don’t run away scared (like I did) they come to us and say “Dada/Papa, can you help me?”, so now that you have enough context on my husband’s parenting let’s go to the incident. 

Last week my mom visited us, while she was here one of our sons, Alexander, had a tantrum because my husband said: “No more TV” he went mad and threw a toy at my husband, and my husband handled the situation as usual and my son ended up apologizing and giving my husband a kiss “to help him heal”. 

My mom told my husband that his parenting was horrendous and was only enabling bad behavior, she went straight to say that Alexander should have been punished the “old way” so he learns, my husband isn’t confrontational but they started arguing. I had enough so I asked my mom to leave our house and (at least) for now she won’t be allowed to see the twins (she visits them almost every day) she called me a jerk and also told some other fam. members and they also called me a jerk, they also accused me of monopolizing my kids and weaponizing them. This isn’t the first time she comments (unsolicited) about our parenting, she does it all the time, she complained that we sent our kids to daycare at a very young age (2 years) among other things and I think we had enough and told her that if she wants to see the kids she has to apologize (to my husband first) and never comment on our parenting again. But she went ballistic and argued that I was disrespecting her and said she wasn’t intruding and was just helping us because “she is older and knows best”, She doesn’t talk to me anymore. I’m not really asking if her parenting is the way but if banning her was the best move.

When I (18m) moved out of my dad's house last year, I also came forward about his abuse and posted on my private Tumblr blog about it.  Well my sister(18f) found my blog somehow and shared it with the whole family and all her friends. This triggered a lot of negative reactions. My step mom was just appalled that I could accuse my dad of stuff like that, and my dad was very very hurt that I saw him that way. When told to, I took the post off of my blog and made a follow up post saying that I wasn't abused and I apologize for painting my father in a bad light. 

A few days later my sister was telling me about how hurt and depressed my dad has been, and how he's never going to forgive me for this. Then I straight up asked her ""what about me? no one ever cared about how he's hurt me and how he's made me suffer for years. why don't you ever care about that"". Because it's true, the only person who ever supported me through living with my dad or so long and how he treated me, was my mom. My sisters always brushed it off and said I being dramatic. 

I don't remember how the rest of the conversation went, but while arguing with my sister she used that conversation as an example to show how I'm selfish, don't care about anyone else, and make everything about me.

Recently, like a month ago, a puppy (pug) was gifted to me by a friend,  The dog is adorable and very playful, however it is really demanding (as a baby, he is just 3 months old) and has never been home without My mother, brother or me, but today The three or us went out to a family birthday, we were going to go really far (like and hour and a half by car) and I choose to leave my dog home.

For The record neither off my uncles pay a thing, My mother and I pay all The bills, however they did inherited a part if The house according to te The laws of my country ( my mother as well received The part intended for her late mother) and my mother and I don't pay rent 

We went out at 6pm and came home at 2 am and when I came home I immediately notice that my door was closed (a thing that I don't do since I have a dog) with my dog inside, so I don't know if my dog have been here all day, this cause a huge fight between my two uncles and I, because I will never though that they will leave  him unattended at my room with The door closed, I think they will just leave him be walking around The living room and Yard area as he always has, needless to say I told them that they were irresponsible and we were paying for all theirs stuff (because they don't even buy food).

However at this time at night looking back I think that  I might have overreacted, since The dog's food and water are on my room and The window was open, however I'm still pissed for not knowing how much time my dog has been inside my small bedroom.

Note: my puppy has severe separation anxiety, so going out for me usually requires someone entertainment my puppy so he doesn't cry.

I (20F) have a friend (20M). We have been friends since high school and up until last year, I never wanted anything more than to get a break from him. To give a short backstory, I lost my parent in highschool and had to deal with the grief alone. About a year and a half ago, this friend of mine lost a close relative and then lost one of his parents within days of each other. He looked to me to talk about this only because I knew what he had gone through. By this time, it had been years since my loss and we had different styles of handling grief. I stayed home because leaving the house was selfish of me and my friend makes plans with anyone to avoid not being home. 

I really wanted to be there for him and I tried but work and transferring to another college were my priorities. I told him numerous times both my parents wanted me to be a college graduate so school was a priority and saving money was too. In the beginning he was calling me every single day but I worked my job almost 6 days a way for being part-time then went home to do homework. I told numerous times I was tired and didn’t feel like facetimeing him, he knows I don’t like facetime either yet still called me a lot. His other group of friends didn’t even try in the beginning to console him and made excuses for not seeing him yet would post that they were with each other. This friend group just had to pick one struggle, either be stupid enough to post that you were out or be inconsiderate of your friend’s grief and they picked both. 

He got upset with me many times this year and in a weird way, was trying to act as if he’s my parent. He kept telling me to take breaks from school and work but I simply ignored him with the promise I had made to my parent to succeed in life and that started with college. This last year he has been nothing but a bother to me with his shit talking behind my back to our friends about how he feels abandoned by me because he’s clearly not that important to me. Our friend group is so supportive, he could have gone to anyone else other than me about his grief which he doesn’t even acknowledge anymore yet it is clear he still is affected by it. 

There are a lot more details I could include but I am limited with words so let’s skip ahead in a time. I transferred to an amazing university and me and this guy rarely talk anymore because he knows now apparently that I am extremely busy with clubs, school, and jobs. The problem is his attitude towards me still. It’s resentful and he plays the victim any time I sarcastically make a comment at him. He sees playful jabs as personal attacks but it’s worse when it comes from me. I went back to counseling recently because I couldn’t deal with every emotion he had and being away from him made me reflect on how shitty he has made me feel. I felt alone in dealing with his emotions and it became too much, So AITA?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4829045,public,top,self,AITA for wanting to not be friends with someone I feel has been suffocating me with their grief?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5sn5c/aita_for_wanting_to_not_be_friends_with_someone_i/,all_ads,6,

Unlike the rest of my husband's siblings and their spouses, I put my foot down from day one and told them to buzz off. I wasn't going to be told what to do. Hell, my own parents don't treat me that way.

Fast forward 16 years later and my husband and his mother fight and argue every single time we go visit them. Histrionic and always plays the victim, and my husband is bullheaded and will never let her win. Even if it's just best to shut up and not say anything he will continue pushing her buttons and so on.

Fast forward to a few days ago for Thanksgiving we went and had a nice dinner and not even an hour into dinner my husband and his mother were getting into it again. I really dislike visiting with his family because this is literally a cycle of vicious vitriol and arguing all the time. Even though I have nothing to do with the arguing I just generally do not like to sit and listen and watch people fight each other constantly.

So we got up and left not even 2 hours after because of their arguing, and then he keeps begging me to go and visit every time they're in town. I don't want to be around them with my husband because it's just the same cycle over and over. I refuse. My husband tells me I'm unreasonable and that they think I don't want to see them. He knows exactly how I feel and I've told him I don't care if that's what they think because that's the truth I don't want to be around them because all you guys do is argue and fight and I don't want to listen to it.

So tonight he asked me to go over there again and I said no. And he said that I'm the one who's wrong. Is it wrong that I don't feel like going somewhere where an argument breaks out within 30 minutes?? Over the prettiest crap ever. Ugh. I just don't want to be around them.

My 3 younger sisters are my bridesmaid's. Megan (27), Avalon (24), Delilah (17). 

Megan is married with 1 child, had a small wedding no bridal party.

Avalon is eloping this summer

Delilah claims she is marrying her boyfriend of 3 months 3 weeks after me.

I have been with my fiance of a decade, everyone is very excited. Too excited.

Megan decided to go overboard with ideas since I had no preference other then them not clashing with each other, but was happy if they were all different styles and colors, as long as the colors complemented each other. I actually love the mixed match style. Matching should be easy though as those 3 could pass for triplets and all look good in the same things, they have the exact same coloring and body type.

However because I am the only larger wedding with photos, I decided to let them pick what they want together so they are happy in the photos. I honestly don't really care, as long as they don't show up looking like brides, for a funeral, or in random fluorescent colors.

Megan and Delilah are at war over concepts, Megan wants one color because she already has a dress in that color. Delilah wants black, even though funeral, and she also already has a dress in Megan's color. Avalon is MOH and called them both out, but had no opinion.

Now they all want me to pick. I said let's all shop together in March or April after I get my dress. They all want to know now to save or order. I told Delilah absolutely no, and that Megan is fine, but I'd really like them to agree.

Avalon and Delilah are mad at Megan for picking based on what she has. They both think I should just tell them what to do.

Am I the asshole for wanting to wait and not having an opinion? They all wear a lot of the color Megan picked. I really don't see the problem. I could be the ass though because I don't want to pick because they all generally hate what I like, I don't want to spend wedding planning fighting over dresses.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4829040,public,top,self,AITA for not caring enough about bridesmaids dresses?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5slg0/aita_for_not_caring_enough_about_bridesmaids/,all_ads,6,

I have 3 close friends and we've been together since 1st grade. Now we're 18 years old, freshman year of college. Since all of us are in 4 different placed, we've sorta drifted apart, we weren't as close as we used to be, at least I don't feel like it. I have a limited online presence. I have zero posts on instagram and haven't posted any story in like 4 years. The only reason I use instagram is to keep in touch with them. And I'm definitely not comfortable with how I look, hence I choose not to post anything, and I'm pretty sure they know that too.

&amp;#x200B;

So one of them shared an ""appreciation post"" with an old picture of the four of us and I genuinely didn't like the way I looked, I'm still very insecure and uncomfortable with how I look and I wished to maintain my anonymity. Now she has a ton of friends and followers and she's very comfortable in sharing her entire life online, and it's her choice, I couldn't care less. So I told her in the group that I wanted the photo to be taken down because I was uncomfortable ( I guess my tone was a little harsh).  She said she won't because the other two are perfectly okay with the photo on her story. She said, ""We can't take down the post, just because YOU don't like it. You just have to learn to love yourself.""

&amp;#x200B;

I just agreed with her because I didn't want to start a fight, but I'm feeling very anxious and insecure, I don't want anyone to see the story. I keep checking her story just to see the imperfections on my face and body and it's just so uncomfortable. I don't know how else to put it.

&amp;#x200B;

And tbh I still don't love myself completely, I still feel ashamed looking at myself and that's why I chose to be incognito on every social media platform. I don't even know if I want to be friends with them, I'm just holding on because we've been together for 12 years and I don't want to be the reason our bond is broken.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4829040,public,top,self,AITA for confronting my friends about my privacy?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5sk7e/aita_for_confronting_my_friends_about_my_privacy/,all_ads,6,

Think very conservative and very traditional. Regardless of how I feel about my clientele, the job pays the bills and it is what it is. I'm being vague for my privacy, but the job is ""normal"" and mainstream (something like selling cars).

My coworker recently approached me incredibly distressed because she's our lowest performing team member and she's making probably about 1/5 of what everyone else makes. She seemed genuinely upset and told me that she needed to earn more commission during the holidays and asked me for any advice I could share with her (since I've worked there the longest and consistently sell the most).

She seemed genuine in her concern so I gave her my honest opinion: she's got a fine personality but could work on her wardrobe. Our clients are older and a lot of them very traditional. I usually go to work wearing a nice dress and heels or smart casual suit that's in a fun color. She dresses more towards the artsy vibe (i.e. dyed hair, kind of casual, and she experiments with her make up a lot. We don't technically have a dress code at work). 

Just to be clear: I personally love her style and thinks she looks great. I don't think there's anything wrong with dressing like that. But in the context of work, I do believe that we need to cater to the client if we want to make the sale. And if our client feels more comfortable buying from someone more dressed up, then that's unfortunately the world we live in. 

I guess that's not the answer she wanted to hear because she got really upset and started crying in the break room.

Her birthday was a month ago and she wanted a big party and I was so down to help host and whatnot. On the day of the party ( her birthday ) we had a breakfast in the morning with some close friends, and I mentioned I was going to go to the store to get like 2 things for the party because I was making deviled eggs. When I said that she directed me to the Google sheet she created for the day and said “ make sure you get everything on the list” mind you she had shared this whole sheet with me earlier but I had no idea that I was expected to pick up all the stuff for food as opposed to just deviled eggs. So I do so thinking she will pay me back. Mind you, I work a half time job until I start grad school and I was I my planning to spend like $10 that day, after getting everything to make a veggie tray from scratch and specific drinks for a game ( 3 bad 2 good everything caffeine free and non alcoholic or chocolate ) and other things for food and whatnot, myself and another friend of ours checked out and it was $80, but I thought she would pay me back so I was okay with it. When I got home I cleaned the whole house and started prepping food and decorations with a  different friend who had bought decorations. Where was my roomate you ask? She had plans all day for her birthday and only showed up a couple hours before the party and spent most of that time on the phone with her parents. I prepped all the food and decorated with other friends. When she got home I gave her the receipt thinking she would pay me back and thanked me for the receipt. A week or so goes by and she hasn’t payed me back so I thought oh she’s just short in cash but we went to n event where I bought us the tickets and that same night she Venmoed me for the ticket so I asked her about the receipt and my $80 and she said “ oh I haven’t even looked at it “ and I was like okay??

This year, 13  people total came (9 adults, two school aged children, a  toddler &amp; an infant).  The guests included my brother (50s M)  from out of town.  My brother brought his 3 children (two in their 20s and a toddler, 3 yo).  

I have a dining room table with 8 seats, a breakfast room with 2 tables (1 table is adult size with 4 seats and 1 table is a toddler table with 4 chairs). Finally, there is a couch in the den with a big screen TV with a coffee table where 2-3 people could sit.  The regulars  know that it is free for all and they can sit wherever they want.  This is my brother’s first time here for Thanksgiving that I can recall in at least 5 years.

After saying grace, I told everyone about the seating in the dining room, breakfast table area, and the den.  I then directed my two school age children to the toddler table and made a seat for my brother and his 3 yo son also.  So there were 3 kids and my brother at this table.  I commented to my brother “you can sit next to your son so you can help him with his meal.”  I brought my brother his cocktail which was in the kitchen and he was helping his son eat.  After everyone else got food, I made another batch of cocktails for everyone and finished heating a final item in the oven.  So about 30 minutes later after everyone else had started eating, I finally fixed myself a plate and looked for a seat.  I headed to the breakfast room and no one was there.  My brother and his sons were done eating and were in the den on the couch watching football,  so I went to the dining room where 5 people including my wife were sitting.  They were all done eating, but they were socializing, so I sat there and ate my meal.  After eating, I hung out in the den with my brother and nephews.  As far as I knew at the time, everyone had a great time and at the end of the night, I walked my brother to his vehicle, gave him and my nephews hugs and wished them a safe trip home.

Well, Saturday I got a confrontational call from my mother saying that my brother told her that I made him sit at the kid’s table and “why did you do that?”  I told her that I would appreciate it if she would ask for my side of the story, before asking a question like that that presumes that I did something wrong.  I told her that I need some time to gather my thoughts so that I can remember  what happened and give a good answer to her question because I felt kinda ambushed by her call.  She said that she didn’t want a “good” answer, she just wanted to “know the truth.”  I told my mother that it makes me feel uncomfortable that she may be implying that me wanting time to gather my thoughts for a good answer before commenting would be untruthful and this conversation is making me feel so uncomfortable that we should end it now and talk another time.
