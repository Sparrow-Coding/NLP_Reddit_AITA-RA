I've gone out of my way to include friends who have not had great families into family functions (with my parents' permission) so they can experience that kind of love and understanding if they've earned my trust at that.

Now, I had a best friend (for the sake of this, we'll address him as J) who had another person in his life (we'll refer to him as B) and they had been at war with each other for literal YEARS. Now, I've never really liked B (he celebrated the overturning of Roe, which puts him DIRECTLY in my Shit List) but I did make an effort to be friends with him, because I wanted to know what was the reason why he and J hated each other so much. Now, J decided that one day, he and a couple of our friends wanted to go and commit a home invasion on B, over the fact that he stole J's gf (for the record, she's no longer with either and on the way to have him convicted for felony stalking and breaching a protective order). Now, not only did they invade B's mon's house, they beat him with baseball bats of the metal variety and also kidnapped said gf, holding her hostage. 

J was convicted and took a plea deal - 10 years in the pen. A friend of ours told me that he wanted to talk to me so we used an app that allows inmates to communicate with loved ones. So I talked to him and we were in contact. He kept on asking me how B and GF was, so I gave him some basic intel and he kept on urging me to send messages to them, which I refused to do so. 

I was talking to be - at this point we were friends - and B asked if he could get some screenshots of the convos I've had with J. I agreed, not thinking anything of it. Next thing I know, I'm picked up by two cops and brought down to the station, who ask me if I knew J. I said yeah, why?

So I was informed as part of the plea deal, J also has a full no-contact order for both B and GF. J had been basically trying to use me to send messages - basically rantings - to break the terms of the no-contact and if I had went along with it, I could have gotten jail time. 

At this point, panic has turned into full-blown rage. I am PISSED. I demand my lawyer and then contact J, yelling at him for this. J feigns innocence and we get into a large argument that ends with me basically saying I hope you rot you piece of shit. As for B, I found out from GF that B was hoping I didn't know any of this so he could get J more time so I naturally exploded at B as well, who tried to tell me ""he respected me for aiding him with this."" I told him he can burn in Hell for this.

So basically, I've officially cut J out of my life, as well as B for this level of deception. But looking back on it, AITA for going that far?

I was tasked with cleaning up his emptied apartment, and my therapist is almost certain that the events that transpired with my father leaving were one of the main reasons I grew up to have Borderline Personality Disorder.

The entire reason my parents got divorced was because my father had a serious gambling addiction that he did not tell my mother about. She only found out because debt collectors visited our house. Their divorce happened when I was two years old, and since then I have had serious attachment issues. My mother had to enroll me in therapy from a young age due to the fact that I would not leave her side, and since then my issues have only gotten worse. I have been sent to the psych ward on numerous occasions due to my BPD and attachment issues.

Fast forward to the present, and I finally agreed to see my father again. At this point, he is very much like a stranger to me, but I wanted so badly to have my father in my life. I was visibly very uncomfortable when we met up at a local restaurant, and he began to poke fun at me for being so uptight about the whole ordeal.

About halfway through, he began to make sour remarks about my step-father. I do not wish to repeat what he said, but they were very insulting and demeaning, especially when my step-father has treated me with nothing but kindness. He has been with my mother and me since I was three years old, and to be honest, I see him as my real parent. He treats me like his real daughter, and even let me take his last name as my own so that I would fit in with the family more.

Obviously, these comments upset me. This was when we began to get into an argument. I told him that I did not know him well. He then proceeded to get angry and tell me, ""Whose fault is that? You never reach out to me."" This made me burst into tears and left the restaurant then and there, and got a taxi back to my apartment.

I feel incredibly guilty. My mother tells me that it was not my fault in the slightest, because I was a child at the time and it was the responsibility of the adult to get to know me. But I can't help but feel like maybe he was right. AITA? Have I done something wrong?

For some context, I (16 f) have divorced parents. I live mostly at my mom's because of school. So, I never really knew why my parents divorced. My mom has then waited 2-3 years before being able to move (lockdown mostly). It was okay, and I was able to move on pretty easily because of how long they've stayed together after they've officially split. The only thing bothering me, is my parent's sexual habits. They're really into kinks n stuff. It wouldn't bother me at all if i didn't hear them having intercourse during those 2-3 years. Thinking about it makes me sick in the stomach. It makes me really upset that they still fucked with their tools and whatnot as a divorced couple. But I guess I understand. Now that they live apart, they've done this way less anyway. 

Now to the reason why I would be the asshole. Yesterday, my mom had a phone call with a friend of hers. She was venting about how my father is toxic and a manipulator, she called him a narcissistic pervert and other stuff. She also said that when she told him she wanted a divorce, he hit her, and she told us she hit a pole. She said that if she would've stayed with him she'd be dead, that him being nice is just a facade. I know he hit her, but only in a sexual way, so I never questioned the sounds of it for my own sake. This conversation surprisingly didn't really shock me as I am used to my mom screaming horrible things about/to my dad. I want to believe her but IDK. I'm mostly just uncomfortable around them especially when one is staying over for the night for xyz reasons. 

She said that they were through, that she's done with him, she claimed being over whatever he's up to, not accepting too much from him, being an independent girlboss woman in stem type of shit yada yada. She also mentioned a girl that I assume is a new girlfriend? I don't really care about her. She told her friend to give her her number, she really insisted. It makes me upset that she has the audacity to fuck him then tell her friend about how bad he has been to her. 

I don't give a fuck who they screw, but you can't just do this, and then say that. It just seems wrong to me. After her phone call, she went to walk the dog. I took my chance to tell her ""you shouldn't be screaming your conversations."" As I implied I heard. she proceeded to shrug ""well.""

When she came back, she said it was none of my business, and I should've closed my door etc. Even with my door closed I would've heard but well. I didn't tell anyone except now. AITA? 

I want to add that I'm not kinkshaming my parents, I'm kink friendly or whatever, it's okay, I'm just very uncomfortable regarding the situation.

Also I know how serious this is, as you don't call anyone a narcissistic pervert like you'd call your bestie a bitch, I just don't know how to deal with this yet.

He's still screaming in my face for it so I tell him no. He does not like it when we tell him no, he'll try bargaining, pleading, or demanding just so he doesn't have to be told no and get what he wants. He goes off on me for not giving him my remote. Obviously his yelling woke up our mom. He then went to her room to get her to get me to give him the remote.

She then goes on to say this is an inconvenience because now she needs to go out of her way to go to a laundromat to finish her laundry and has to stay out late to finish her laundry.

I was a little confused on how there would even be a mess so after asking, she said because her clothes are soaking in water, so there may be a puddle after she moves her clothes out of the washer. I told her then to wring out the clothes before she takes it out so the water would be minimal but she said it’s not like she has a power wringer. Because I created the “mess” by not buying a new washer, she thinks it’s my responsibility should there be an extra charge. I said if there is an extra charge to the cleaning, she would be responsible for it. I am quite upset about the way she reacted thinking that it’s my fault she would need to go to the laundromat to get her clothes cleaned and expecting me to pay the extra in cleaning when it’s a mess she made.

My ex and I were together for a few years, until a few months ago I broke up with him. During our relationship we played a lot of PC games together, and towards the end of the relationship he upgraded his graphics card and offered me his old one. At the time I refused partly because he could have sold it for $500, and partly because I knew things were heading south and I would have felt bad taking it right before a potential break up.

We've now been apart for a few months - after a period of no contact we're trying to be friends again but I know he still has residual feelings for me and hopes of us getting back together. We were chatting about an upcoming PC game a few days ago and I mentioned I wouldn't be able to play it because my graphics card crapped out. He then offered me the same graphics card he wanted me to have during our relationship, and said he wouldn't accept any money for it.

WIBTA for taking it for free? While I didn't ask and he was the one that offered, I still feel kind of bad taking something so expensive off him. On top of that, I worry that if I do accept it then I'll kind of be obligated to play the game with him when it comes out.

I often invite my (20m) boyfriend over to hang out on weekends or after classes. The first few times were amazing and we got to play videos games, cuddle, and watch anime together. However, since he has been over many of times, I figured he needed to officially meet my parents instead of just short greetings. 

I was extremely nervous because I had no clue how my parents were going to react. Ultimately, my mom was happy that I had finally found someone after never dating in highschool (which was a big relief). However, my boyfriend still needed to meet my father, and my father can be rather socially distant and seem mean. So when introducing them I mentioned something that they both like: Seinfeld. My father started being chipper and accepting of my boyfriend. Much so to a point that whenever I left them in a room for longer than 10 minutes my father and boyfriend would start watching Seinfeld together. 

At first I thought this was cute and was glad they were bonding, however it’s all that happens when my boyfriend comes over anymore. Whenever we come home, my dad has a Seinfeld marathon ready to watch and my boyfriend immediately sits down and watches it with him for HOURS. I’ll try to cuddle with him or ask if he wants to go play games and he says “after a few more episodes.” HOWEVER, indeed after “a few more episodes” he will either keep watching or go to my room and pass out on my bed.

Whilst in the middle of a Seinfeld marathon, I told my boyfriend that I was getting tired of not being paid attention to, and said that he needed to stop watching Seinfeld with my father. His rebuttal to me was “why should it matter, I’m still hanging out with you?” I said to him I didn’t feel like he even loved me and he looks to my dad and says “what’s the deal with women?”

We’d do so much together and I told her all my secrets, that kind of teenage bestie shit. Now she was really into the emo and scene subcultures, and since I’d been raised by a metalhead dad and a goth mum I was so excited to have another alternative friend and so I grew to adopt some of their mannerisms, like using XD in every text and also I started listening to some bands that they did (which is what all friends do). But apparently she had some problems with this, because they’d always put on their instagram story stuff like people need to stop copying me or go kys stop trying to be me. Every time I reached out to them i would always apologise and stuff because I didn’t want them to hate me and they’d always try to tell me that it was about someone else but whenever I’d ask who I got left on seen. And this was would happen every other month or so, so I was constantly stressed out about what to say to them and I started to become very anxious and people-pleasing. For example I’d never use XD when texting them because I didn’t want her to think I was ‘copying’ and I’d only listen to the bands they liked in secret. All of this had a really severe effect on my mental health because I was forcing myself to act like the person they wanted me to be instead of who I wanted to be (for example I’d tell her I was goth when really I was emo/scene like her). This went on for a period of 1 or 2 years until recently, when I had just had enough of the negativity.

I had introduced the two over a call where she ment my gf K (19f). 

Now me, K, and D had all been bffs for 4 years prior to meeting S and way in the past me and D dated (im pan and trans).

Only a month after the call they started dating and thats when things started going down &amp; where I might be TA.

S wanted to hang out evrey night with me, I did have to cancel a lot. She has her own mental health issues that when I canceled qi thought she might do something. 

Then it turned. 

When I would cancel id get guilt tripped. For an example I gave myself a concussion by diving onto my bed (was not a good idea as I found out). S than went on to say it was on purpose.

Stuff like this had continued for the next months. A few times I had caught her giving K bad looks but I shrugged it of thinking it was just my imagination, that was untill S told me.

One day me and S were talking because D had become distance with me and K. Thats when S tried to make me not trust K. She said that they could be going behind our backs and cheating. Lucky for me tho I know K enough that K wouldnt &amp; for a fact D and K see eachother as family, I tired to explain it to her and eventually told her

""You shouldn't be worried about K &amp; D, if anyone it should be me since IVE dated D.""

S just ignored that.

A few months had passed and I hadn't been hanging out with S that often, I wasn't hanging out with anyone or texting anyone BUT K 3 since I was busy. 

S then texted me. She explained how her grandma was dying and I went to respond untill she sent another message. The text was that if I didn't want to be her friend anymore to just say so and that she will go.

That sounded like a guilt trip, so I didn't answer. How was I to answer that? sorry your grandma is dying I apologize for the inconvenience. 

K then decided that me and D should talk.

Well on call he explained his feelings on the situation, how S is hurting, upset &amp; how S is the most perfect being in the world. And then I snapped. After not sleeping, worrying that shed harm herself, the constant guilt trips and everything else in between. 

I screamed what I had been going threw with S, how she tried to suggest that him and K had been hooking up, using my own trama as a weapon, and so much more. I was in tears from all this stuff for the past 2 years.

When I went quiet all D said was That it was my fault for her actions and IATA.

At this point I ended the call.

For about a year, as one of her hands has been swollen and she says it's painful to do things - no official diagnosis from the doc yet. I feel like I've always helped her out when I can and she does things for me too, which helps as I study full-time, work part-time and usually do insane hours. 

For me, the issue is that since she can't do certain things, she seems to have decided that I'm going to do them and then gets angry when I don't. To be clear, I never agreed to anything, it wasn't even a conversation, her logic seems to be 'well you know I can't do it, so now you have to do it all'. 

I've spoken to her a few times about this, always calmly sitting down with her and saying something like, okay let's try to find a solution. But it doesn't seem to have helped. 

It seems to come back to 'your whole life I've done things for you' 'other people do this for each other' 'we're family why don't you want to do these things for me'.

Also, I'm really trying to take her at face value that she's in pain and can't do everything - I do not want her to be in pain or risk being in pain, but she seems to be able to do things she wants to (e.g. moving boxes and things in and out of storage), but point blank refuses to try doing the things she's asking me to do. I get that sometimes things are easier to do than other times and/or maybe she wants to keep her 'hand energy' for things she enjoys. 

At the same time, I don't get why this means I have to do everything now - or, if I don't do it, it just doesn't get done - which isn't sustainable for things like getting groceries. We've talked about getting someone to help her (an actual carer or something), but she doesn't want a stranger in the house and we'd have to figure out how to pay for it anyway.

It's been almost a year. At this point, it's not even so much about the things she's asking me to do, as much as feeling like I don't have a choice. If I do the things, she's grateful, but if I say no, she becomes passive aggressive or outright starts an argument. It feels like she thinks she's entitled to my time/energy/existence, to do things for her. Even as a kid I tried to take care of her, so maybe I enabled it in the past, but it doesn't seem healthy. 

Today I realised it feels like she is doing everything she can to try and force me into doing what she wants, like I exist to take care of her always, for whatever she wants, indefinitely. 

I agree she needs help with things and have tried to be supportive. I don't agree that I need to be the one providing that help.

Context:
We were throwing a friendsgiving with all of our friends from our college. I was able to have it at my house because my parents were out of town and it would be easy for everyone to come to my house and not keep any of my family up if my friends stayed late. 

The entire idea was hers. She asked if I could have it at my house for the reason above. I was like YES PLEASE. My dining room table can fit 8 people. I invited 4 of our friends and then I had me and my bf (who everyone has met) and her and her bf (who I have never met before) for a total of 8 people. 

We all had things that we had to bring to the party. I split it up where someone was bringing something.
1: making dessert
2: stuffing
3: sweet potato casserole
4 &amp; 5: mashed potatoes (the girl and her bf)
6: making brownie tray 
7 &amp; 8: chickens (sub for turkey) and mac and cheese (me and my bf)
Dinner would be at 6:00PM on the dot. Everyone knew of this time frame and was told A MONTH in advance that they have to be there at 6 or they will eat when they get there. 

From here I will call her A to make it easier to follow. 

Person 6 texted me that morning to tell me that she could not make it because she had to go to her bf’s play at 7PM and wouldn’t have time to eat. Totally fine, no more brownie tray so I was like no problem we can figure it out.

A reached out to me to let me know that she could not make the mashed potatoes anymore and she could bring cookies and brownies instead. I was like no problem. 

At 12 PM, A texts me telling me that her bf had to work until 5 and she might be late because of this. I was at the store and asked if she wanted me to pick up the dessert and she never responded, so I got it and told her that she can just come right to the party because I picked everything up for her so she can just come right to my house and she can just pay me back for them. 

At 3:30PM, she responded. A got mad at me and said that it was rude for me to do that because she wanted to bring something. I then said to her, “you can pay me for the stuff that I picked up. I did this so you won’t be even more late to the party than you said you would be.”

Some time later (4PM right before I was going to start cooking), A messages me and says that I am a bitch and she “no longer feels like coming and her boyfriend won’t want to go alone because he doesn’t know anyone there.” 

I spent over $60 to be able to have enough food for everyone to eat and then I was down to 5 people that would be at my house after buying enough food for 8 people. 

I told A, “Do what you want. Thank you for the heads up. Enjoy your night.” She has not spoken to me since then.

Two happened to be the same; she was going to one of the places next year. We mentioned visiting the other place together. A few months later we were checking flights and they were very cheap! We mutually decided to book tickets.

Later I texted her that she could feel free to invite her bf if she wanted to! Almost all of my female friends are in long term relationships with wonderful partners, Eve included. I have never minded being the “third wheel” so long as the partner doesn’t mind me being there and everyone feels comfortable. 

Eve said he wasn’t coming so it was just going to be us. A month later, we were getting drinks with other coworkers. I got the feeling I was irritating her that night. Later she texted me that her bf “Joe” was going to come after all. I have a hunch she was rethinking traveling alone with me and asked him to join. Whatever the reason, it was fine with me! 

Minus one place I found, Eve did most of the Airbnb bookings. We have/are splitting the cost of lodging/car rental/gas/activities equally. We’ve been here a week and are leaving tomorrow. Throughout the trip, I’ve felt varying degrees of exclusion. Joe is not the problem, it’s Eve I am having issues with. Here are some examples:

•We’ve mostly stayed at airbnbs but last night at a hotel. She booked two rooms, one for them, one for me, and mine was not adjoining or even near theirs. It felt weird finishing dinner (around 7pm) and then chilling in my room solo till the next morning. 

•The places are all small and most have a “real” bed and then a small fold out bed. I’ve been expected to take the fold out one every time, and they’re often uncomfortable.

•I’m known in all of my friend groups for loving taking photos and candids of people. For some reason I tend to befriend people who are the exact opposite which results in me having few photos of myself. Before the trip I asked Eve if she wouldn’t mind taking some pictures of me (the views here are amazing). Multiple times on hikes to waterfalls and caves, she’s stopped Joe to take scenic photos of him. She hasn’t taken any of me. Of course I could’ve asked, but it feels uncomfortable feeling like you’re forcing someone to.

•Eve doesn’t like driving, Joe and I do. She always sits in the front because her motion sickness is worse in the back (?) which means when I’m in the back, I’m basically excluded from conversations. They talk about their future trips/concerts and stories about friends I don’t know, which makes it harder to contribute to those conversations. 

Basically, it feels like I chose to tag along on a couple’s trip when it was originally a trip with Eve. I was ok with him coming and vocalized such, so this is partially my fault.

We had planned for down time for adjustment. During this time I knew things would be tight. She sent me money to get food when I was out with the kids, order pizza and other food, didn’t care about budgeting.  She kept talking about how she was planing to pay on each bill. Money from here and there, help in some cases. I figured we were fine otherwise we should be eating at home where the money can go further, or budget what we get. Certainly not buying unnecessary things. So when she started yelling at me about something unrelated to expenses I had no idea. Eventually it comes out that we are very behind, not just tight but many bills unpaid. She has told me I need to figure out rent because it’s my fault for not bringing in money, and has left to a second place we had been renting to try and start a business. I stay home with our 3 kids and home school them. I have filed for disability. It wasn’t always like this but working hard when I was the one working combined with a physical disorder. I just can’t work like before. 

My mom died a couple years ago. The last couple weeks my wife keeps telling me to go through and figure out what we can sell. I do not want to do this. She kept telling me to figure things out I need to find income, and when I got upset a couple nights ago I said how can she tell me to sell things for $10-$20 each when she ordered pizza for $32 two days ago? (I don’t know the finances , any time I try to budget while we are shopping and the kids want something I am met with complete resistance. Since I don’t earn the money I never press the matter). There are 3 things that might be worth something , all have the highest sentimental value out of all it all. One my mom wanted to donate to a museum and I convinced her to let me keep it. Every thing else in there wouldn’t be worth much.
She starts telling me she can do whatever she wants with her money. And I need to figure it out for this apartment. Then tells me I’m not allowed to move into the place she is staying because the owner won’t allow it. 
Only reason I can see is the owner is trying to plan for a future set up where my wife is available for their kid. A sentiment that has already been expressed over and over. Something I have never felt too great about, and honestly feel is quite rude to do. My wife has just found it amusing. Also denies that could possibly be a reason, because “kid is not coming back here”. 
Or maybe it wasn’t even said and that was being used against me. I don’t know.
The second place was also supposed to be a fall back if we needed to drop one place. That was the planned course this summer. 
 I am being told I better figure out two months rent and I don’t know what to do I feel super crushed because I really don’t want to sell those things.

My dad was a drug addict who died of an overdose when I was 11. 

My mother was also a drug addict who used all her money on drugs especially after my father's death and I found myself at 16 supporting a house, as my mother used all their money on drugs. 

I have 2 brothers  (8M and 7M). I graduated and  after all nights studying, I managed to pass the exam for a public position that pays very well at only 19 years old.

From that, I had to leave the house and I called the CPS to facilitate. They easily recognized that it was a terrible home and I got custody of my brothers. It became permanent after 1 year, as I was fully able to support my siblings, while my mother had to move out of the house she lived in and live with friends because she could not support herself.

After I gained permanent custody, I went into NC with my mom, as well as decided it would be necessary for her to cut off contact with my siblings.

 That was 4 years ago and my brothers are fine, healthy, no sequel to what their childhood was and they live a good life with me and my fiancée. 

My maternal grandmother contacted me, saying that my mother had been sober for 7 months,  she had spent 1 year in rehab and that she wants to start reconnecting, because she saw all her mistakes.

 I replied no, she is the kind of person I am able to forgive, but never allow back into my life or the lives of innocent children. S

he even complained, but I ended up hanging up. She and my mother know that the judge will not even grant the right to visit, so it's on me.

I don't know how, but Sunday she appeared at the door of the house and it was my brother who opened,, not giving me time to kick her out quickly. In short, she made a drama in  front of them, saying that she wanted to be a mother again to my brothers and that I'm denying her and them this + more crying after she was kicked out. 

Since then, my brothers are insisting that I allow them to be a family and are angry with my decision that despite considering their opinion, I need to he responsible and  make decisions that value their safety and  may not be pleasant decisions. 

They are totally angry with me and I've already made it clear to my mom that if she shows up near us again, she'll get a restraining order.

 I'm hearing from many relatives that I should give it a chance and also respect my siblings' request to see her, but I don't think it's safe,  but I'm Lost here and would like a outside opinion.

My kids have been asking about my mom and family since they were old enough to realize that my husband (27m) has parents and siblings around and I don't. My reasons for not wanting to tell them about my mom are really good reasons I think.
For some back story
I was raised in a polygamist cult that was fairly notorious for crimes involving children. When I was 13 my parents divorced and my mom got full custody. The reason for the divorce was that my dad wanted to leave the cult and she didn't. 
We lived with my mom and stayed apart of the cult where they caused insurmountable damage that I'll need a lifetime of therapy to sort out and heal from. My dad died when I was 14 and my mom and older brother (who was helping financially provide for my mom and her kids) refused to let us go to his funeral for reasons relating to the cult. 
A few months after my dad's death my brother had tried to pawn me off on anyone he knew that would take me in because I couldn't live with my siblings (again for cult reasons) he took me to a farm of a family I knew (I was friends with their daughters) and dropped me off. This was 200+ miles from where my mom lived at the time. He told me to never call them again and left. The family took me in and raised me until I was 18, pretty much adopted me. 
Now I hadn't talked to my mom in about 8 years and only in the last 2 years I've talked to her on her birthdays. 
In her defense the cult forbids her from talking to former cult members, but my kids were never members. 
So I'm trying to decide if I should tell my young kids that she is already dead like their grandfather because she has refused to meet/talk to them.

I (19M) live with my family at home as a college student. I have two younger siblings: K (17F) and E(14NB). The three of us don’t get along very well often, which sucks because I love the both of them a lot. We also have three dogs, and each of us is assigned as the caretaker of one dog. 

K and E don’t do very well with taking care of their dogs. E prefers to sit around and play Genshin, pushing off chores to me more often than not, but they do care for and pamper their dog a lot. 

K, on the other hand, does nothing to care for her dog. She doesn’t groom him (he is a stinky little Shih Tsu, so he needs lots of grooming), clean his ears, feed him, or let him out to use the bathroom. He has escaped from the house several times on her watch (I had to track him down and bring him back and she would swoop in to take him each time).

All of the leftover chores fall to me, the oldest, to take care of. I love my animals so I normally have no problem with doing so, but it’s stressful considering I have to care for all of them regularly and E’s dog has her brother and sister (our cousins’ dogs) visiting for Thanksgiving break. I have to care for three huge puppies and two adult dogs almost completely alone should I not want to risk my parents’ complaints. 

K’s dog recently got an ear infection, which she had no clue about until I told her after the vet appointment. I’d ordered his medicine and applied it to him since the day I got it, along with my dog’s medicine for a skin infection. K’s dog’s infection had gotten to the point where he was in a lot of pain and it broke my heart. Today I was supposed to go in to get my girl checked out, but her skin had completely cleared up so I had decided to take her brother by himself. 

I went into the kitchen earlier today to eat lunch and was immediately jumped on by both K and E for not taking the dogs at noon. I was confused and upset; they were very angry at me for a reason I didn’t understand (I’d never said I was taking them at noon) and had immediately resorted to screaming at me. I began a back and forth shouting match with them (primarily K) which resulted in me leaving the kitchen and going back to my room.

K came to me close to an hour later demanding why I didn’t take her dog. I told her that he isn’t my responsibility and that I do all of the work in caring for him, that I literally had to force her to start giving him actual care and even then half the time she doesn’t do it. I then flat out told her that I wouldn’t be taking her dog. She was outraged and won’t speak to me. 
I’m super conflicted now because I don’t prefer to have my sister angry at me and I feel bad for not taking care of the dog. He doesn’t deserve to be caught up in this.

We previously made about the same salary, but he recently got a promotion where he'll be making almost 30k more than me. I assumed that since our incomes and budgets are different, we would pay different rents instead of splitting it 50/50.

WHAT HAPPENED: I recently mentioned that we should pay different rents since we make different amounts and have different budgets. I felt like it was a reasonable request, if not a requirement when partners make different $$. From his reaction, he took the comment as me making the financial decision for him. He had never heard of splitting rents by different income and was strongly against the idea of anything other than 50/50. I couldn't wrap my mind around why someone would be upset about this ask, so I made a document that broke down my student loan expenses, monthly take home pay, and reasons why it made sense to split by income. 

CONTEXT: We are not married and have not lived together before. I currently live with roommates and he lives alone. I have a stressful relationship with money, having grown up in a house where money was tight and am currently paying off my student loans. He grew up in an affluent household and hasn't had a stressful relationship with money. Although this isn't a reason for why we should split by income, it informs me of how our reactions to this idea were quite different.

I am willing to spend equal amounts on rent if we find a place within my budget (e.g. if I can spend up to 1200, I would be fine splitting a place that was 2400 total). But, I have looked and rent is quite expensive and out-of-my-budget for us to split equally. He also has amenities he wants (like a washer/dryer in unit) that drive up the price of rent, where I would be OK without this amenity. I feel like I have to make argument points that explain why rent-splitting by income is fair. Simply, we don't make the same amount of money. He recently got the promotion and it hasn't set in yet, so maybe it felt like I was taking advantage of the promotion. That wasn't my intention, and we have plenty of months before moving in where he will be making his new salary. If I was in the position where he was laid off, or I began to make more money, I would pay more to help us make ends meet.

Rent is the biggest spend item for me, and I'm not even asking to split bills or groceries based on our income. If we split based on income and our budgets, we would have more flexibility in places we can live in. I still feel like it was reasonable of me to assume different incomes meant different rents we would pay, but it landed really poorly.

My cousin Mark and his wife Patricia have two children: Jennifer and Lexi. School was very difficult for Jennifer. She had many problems with bullies and a traditional school environment just didn’t accommodate her learning style. Lexi performed very well in that environment. Lexi was able to skip a grade in elementary school and was considered a violin prodigy.

Instead of trying to help Jennifer with her learning struggles or encourage Jennifer’s talents, Mark and Patricia would negatively compare her to Lexi. Things like “Lexi has twice as many friends as you, and she’s four years younger!” or “Lexi skipped a grade and has all A’s, yet you’re only getting a C in English!” or “Lexi can do things that are actually useful.” Mark and Patricia would talk about raising Jennifer and Lexi by saying “The screw-up always comes before you do something great” 

I would stand up for Jennifer because Mark and Patricia were clearly hurting her with such incredibly cruel statements. Mark and Patricia would only respond that we were both being oversensitive. And how their comments were good because they would “motivate” Jennifer to be “as ambitious and advanced” as her younger sister. 

Jennifer and Lexi are now adults. Jennifer moved out as soon as she financially could and has had no contact with Mark or Patricia since. Lexi fell into bad habits when she entered college and eventually dropped out of the university. She no longer plays violin. Lexi flips off and curses at her parents. She essentially told Mark and Patricia “Fuck you. It’s my life and I’m doing whatever the hell I want with it.”

Because Lexi is no longer fulfilling their expectations or doing things they can boast about, Mark and Patricia are trying to get back into contact with Jennifer. But Jennifer wants nothing to do with them. Mark and Patricia were complaining because after using a fourth phone number to contact Jennifer (she had just blocked them previously) Jennifer called them out for only contacting her because Lexi was no longer available.

Mark and Patricia tried to get sympathy by saying they have no idea why Jennifer has “abandoned” them. I told Mark and Patricia it serves them right that Jennifer wants nothing to do with them. They always made her feel unvalued compared to Lexi. Of course, Jennifer doesn’t want to be their golden child now that Lexi has lost their favor.

Most of the younger family members agree with what I said (including Jennifer.) Because Mark and Patricia would have likely never contacted Jennifer if Lexi was still doing what they wanted. But most of the older family members said that I was an asshole because Mark and Patricia are realizing their mistake and I’m just kicking them when they’re already down. Even if Mark and Patricia were truly sorry for raising Jennifer as if she were less than Lexi, it doesn’t excuse them from the consequences of doing it. But the older family members are saying it wasn’t the time or place to say what I did.

I did always say that I would have an abortion if I got pregnant because I'm not ready to have kids.
When I told my partner, he said something like ""That's okay you're just going to get an abortion right?"" Which is true but now that I was actually in the situation it wasn't so clear cut for me. I just needed a little bit of time to come to the full acceptance and process the decision so I wouldn't regret it. My partner got really intense when I said I hadn't completely decided, and I was probably going to do the abortion but I just needed time to decide. He basically kept pushing me to give him an answer and tell him where I was at, even though where I was at was a bit of shock and hesitation to make a concrete decision. (I had only found out that day)

Anyways, he kept pressing and I decided to clarify with him that while his opinion on what I should do is really important in making my decision, it is actually my decision and not his. He absolutely flipped out at this and left the house, came back and slept in the spare room for 2 nights while I lay pregnant and sad and very alone. 

For some context, he cheated on me a year before that with a girl he'd met just the one time and she fell pregnant, and didn't tell him until the baby was 3 weeks. So understandably he was scared of this kind of commitment being thrust upon him without his say. But I explained to him that his input matters and I wouldn't ever make a decision that would disregard his feelings. I just needed to own the decision myself so I couldn't find anyone to resent if I regretted my decision later on. 

He did not appreciate that and said he thought we were a team making ""we"" decisions so he's upset that I said that was my decision at the end of the day. 

Now, we've gone on a trip and he's mentioned that he wants kids. I instantly remembered the pain of being left alone pregnant for two nights and explained I'm not ready for that and I never want to be in that position again. He essentially doubled down and then said to me that the house we live in is his and not mine because hes paying the mortgage, and yes I don't own it but I thought it was my home too because I pay a very fair contribution to live here. I've also offered to contribute to mortgage but he always says no so I buy all the groceries and send him money fortnightly.

I saw someone making a thread of posts on why the trilogy is a masterpiece. I started reading it and regretted it when I got near the end. They said “It’s not the best trilogy of all time, but it’s one of my favorites.”

I did not like reading that. I was furious and handled this situation the best I possibly could. I started ranting on their post and telling them that if they didn’t take back what they said that I would dox them. They said that I shouldn’t be mad over the trilogy not being their favorite of all time, which was immature of them to tell me.

They gave me no choice but to dox them. I leaked their full address, full name, phone number, and email to get back at them. Then I let things be and tried to forget about it. Later, I just couldn’t resist checking back on that conversation. 

Turns out they blocked me for it. I did not like that they did that. I checked in incognito mode to make sure that they changed it and said that Kung Fu Panda IS the best trilogy ever. They didn’t do it. Doxxing them wasn’t enough apparently because all I saw was “This reply was hidden by the original Tweet author.”

But I already had their address. I knew exactly what to do with it. I hacked into their account and said every sensitive word I could think of. (Yes, even skadoosh bag.) Then I replied with all their personal info. They ended up deactivating their account. But that’s not all. THEY CALLED THE COPS ON ME! I did nothing to deserve this! I was just defending my honest opinion. 

I showed the police screenshots for evidence of what they said. The police sided with me once they saw “It’s not the best trilogy of all time, but it’s one of my favorites.” Honestly, I feel like most people would’ve done the same.

I showed him that I had only been using the app to try and make friends and even showed him my conversations and profile etc. After this him and his friends laughed at me for using an app like this, I was so embarrassed. After the dinner I went home and received texts from him saying it was very inappropriate of me to be using BUMBLE and he wasn’t comfortable with it. We got in a fight because I was already embarrassed and I was mad because I wasn’t using the app with negative intentions and he couldn’t understand that.

This is based in the U.K. I found out yesterday, that my Aunt left her 6 year old Son (my cousin) locked up at home by himself, while she went to his Parents evening. (She knew about this for a while, but didn’t organise any baby sitting for him, even though she gave her 3 year old to another relative to look after). She instructed my Mum to keep talking to my 6 year old Cousin via FaceTime while she was gone. My 6 year old cousin was alone at home by himself, which is not legal in the U.K. My Mum told me that his Parents have done this many times in the past, which I only found out yesterday. 

I called child social services and reported my Aunt, because this is neglect/abuse. (I reported them to social services in the past for something similar, but social services did nothing. My Aunt then moved her and her kids to a new House and school in a new Town. They didn’t know that I reported them.) My Aunt got called by child social services today, and has now banned me from seeing my Cousin and contacting her and her Husband. Apparently, only my Mum and I knew that she left my Cousin alone, so she figured out I reported her. 

I helped bring up my Cousin, I love him like he’s my child. I’ve only ever tried to do what is best for him. 

His Parents are the awful ones. Why am I the one being fucking punished?! They should be punished! I’ve always gone out of my way to help and protect my Cousin. Everyone in my family knows how shit his Parents are, but I’m the only one who has actually been trying to help! I don’t think Cousins have legal rights like Grandparents do though.

My Mum said that no one in the family wants to talk to me anymore, and I am banned from seeing my Cousin. I can’t imagine my life without my Cousin. I’ve helped raise him, he’s like my baby.

I don’t know what to do. My Cousin needs me and I need him. I feel completely lost, alone and depressed. I don’t know what to do.

She talked about how she was looking at train tickets and how its possible to schedule an overnight train ride there, hang around town for a few hours and then schedule a ride back right after the concert but i didnt think it was a good idea at the time. 

i thought about it and tbh its not like i didnt have the money to go and it was the 1st time this band was touring in the US i think. plus i was feeling pretty depressed this week so maybe ijust need to get out of the house and have a small trip by myself y'know? and i stopped caring about what my mom thoughta long time ago lol. so i got a ticket for just me. she saw that i was getting ready to go and asked where i was going and i told her that i was going out to the concert after all. she got really excited but then she asked if she could come with and i told her it would be too bothersome to do with two people and she said okay and left so i assumed she understood where i was coming from with wanting some alone time.

i ended up having tons of fun on the trip, it was super exciting just walking around a new city, i went to that area's chinatown for a few hours and then went to the concert and got some merch from the band (didnt get to meet them unfortunately) and slept on the train ride there and back instead of getting a hotel. of course i told my sister about my trip when i got back and gave her a souvenir and everything seemed fine. but then my sister's boyfriend texted me the other day and told me ""you know, youre sister was really upset when you went on that trip without her, right?"" first off, i didnt know she wanted to go to it? plus even if she told me, i think she's just being clingy, i dont have to include her in everything i do? like if anything i would invite my boyfriend first and foremost but i didnt even invite him cos i really needed something like a solo trip for me, my mental health was really suffering. im also the oldest so growing up, i've always been expected to include my siblings in everything. plus even if i did bring her then i'd be responsible for her like i always am and she's anxious and tends to second guess a lot of things i do and it really pisses me off.

i was telling my friend about everything and she suggested that maybe aita because my sister put the plan together and i didnt include her. which i can kind of see but its not hard to put together a train schedule? PLUS my sister hasnt even said anything to me about if she is upset so i really dont think im in the wrong.

We went our separate ways (pursued different careers) and kept in touch via social media. She got a bit cold, which normally happens, but I kept on commenting on her posts since I like her. 

A few years ago, I saw her visit a place close to where I’m living now. Messaged her if she’d be traveling through my city and told her I’d love to see her. No response. 

Now the story. Last year, she messaged me asking how I am. We were able to catchup quickly and asked if she can stay with me since she’ll be in town. I agreed since I wanted to see her. 

It turns out, I was her backup for her board and lodging if things don’t work with her BF. It didn’t workout, hence this post. When she moved in, she decided to stay indefinitely. I was kind of okay with it, but a bit uncomfortable, because us catching up seemed super fast paced and then asking to stay at my place was bit blunt for my taste. 

She then went out on dates and eventually met her new BF and immediately moved in with him. I thought, she’d change her address after that, but I’ve been getting mail for her. When I message her about it, she’d show up to pick it up, hang out for a couple of hours and never hear from her again until I get another mail. I asked her to update her address via USPS, but I’m still getting her mails.

Basically, yesterday morning I went to one of those big chain thrift stores to exchange an item I'd bought a week prior. A couple employees recognize me at this store, which is why I'm so worried about this since they'll know me if I shop there again.

After finding some new clothes that I liked enough to exchange, I'd stopped in a corner to take out my old receipt to check if the price of this new item matched the price of my old item. When I say corner, though, it's in the widest aisle in the store so there's very high visibility.

A worker I’d never seen before came out of their stock room (about 10-15 ft away) just as I’d put my receipt back in my bag. She started calling out to me to get my attention, alerting nearby customers (two older ladies in the adjacent aisle and a younger woman in the same aisle).

It pretty much went like this:

Her: What exactly are you doing over there in the corner? (It sounds neutral typed out, but she said it very accusatory, so much so that I immediately understood that she thought I was stealing. I believe the other customers thought so, too, since they stared at me oddly the whole time - like the older ladies looked suuuper affronted by me)

Me: Huh?

Her: What are you doing over there in your cart?

Me: I was checking an old receipt.

Her: No, you weren’t. You know that you don’t do that here. You do that at the front desk.

Me: Huh? (She said “you know,” like I knew, but I still have no clue what she meant by this)

Her: You’re not allowed to be in the corner like that. You have to stop.

I said something like, “oh, okay,” before walking away. She must’ve thought I'd put a store item in my bad and immediately called me out thinking I was stealing? I swear I didn’t put anything else in my bag but my receipt.

I did my exchange at the front and left, but ended up returning. I spoke with one of their store managers about it, which is a first for me (I work in retail, so I know how it is). I just felt humiliated and thought it could’ve been handled it better. To me, it felt wrong that she'd accused me in front of other people and so loudly, too, so they all heard. I thought she could've walked up to me to ask, instead? It felt even more wrong because she had so little to go off of, seeing that she never actually saw what I’d put into my bag and it could’ve easily just been my phone or my wallet or what it actually was, which was my receipt.

I said I didn’t want to get their employee in trouble, so I guess there’s that, but I haven’t stopped wondering whether the employee even acted wrongly in the first place. She never outright said the word ‘stealing’ and I was in a corner where people must've stolen before.

Luka is the cautious kind of guy. He brought eight changes of clothes for three days. After we arrived home (my parent's home), Lana went through Luka's baggage and stole one of his old shirts. Since she left a huge mess, Luka didn't realize a shirt had disappeared. We brushed off her tantrum because we thought she was jealous that I got a boyfriend and was spending less time with her.

Today, I took Lana's bedclothes to wash and found the stolen shirt under her pillows. I questioned her, and she confessed she had a crush on Luka and took the shirt. I told Lana that she would have to apologize and return the shirt the next time he came to our house.

Lana begged me not to humiliate her by making her ask forgiveness over an old shirt. She reasoned that since Luka didn't notice his missing shirt, it meant it wasn't a big deal. She said I could return it as long as I lied to Luka, telling him he had forgotten it in my room.

I threatened Lana that if she didn't apologize privately tomorrow, I would let our parents know. I'm concerned about her behavior, not a piece of clothing. Once she saw I stood my ground, she changed her attitude and mocked I was worried that Luka was using me for a test drive. *I tried to translate her joke, but in case it wasn't clear: she meant Luka would exchange me for her in the future.* I left her room. Otherwise, I would have lost my temper.

Two hours later, Lana came to my room sobbing and asked me for forgiveness. She said she would do anything (but apologize) to make up to me. I told her I would reconsider to calm her down.

He used to get drunk to the point of blacking out and would just generally annoy everyone with sloppy drunk behavior. We would talk to him about it and ask him to stop but never got too serious about it.

Recently, it's become a SERIOUS problem. I don't even know where to begin so in no specific order: has been arrested for things hes done while drunk, has spoken down to and/or left my mom on several occasions and came back and said he ""didn't mean it"" when sober, showed up to the hospital after the birth of my daughter sloppy drunk, has a dead spot in his brain visible on an mri caused by drinking (among the other general health problems caused by it), and has totalled a car. That's all I can think of that I'm allowed to mention on this sub but all this has happened in the last year.

Like I said, we've had multiple conversations with him and he always says he'll stop but he doesn't. My mom took his car keys which he agreed to but complains about but he will just order alcohol or walk to get it. Any time my mom goes to spend time with a friend, goes grocery shopping, drops him off at the gym, etc, he will get drunk. He has been to support groups and substance abuse counseling but he refuses to go to rehab.

The most recent time he left my mom, a couple nights ago, she asked him, ""don't you want to spend Thanksgiving with your family?"" and he said ""I want to spend it with my family. I don't want to spend it with you"" and got an uber to the airport.

My dad LOVES my daughter (2 months). He has come to town to see her a few times and hasn't been drunk while around her (except the day she was born). What he said to my mom sent me over the edge. At first when she told me that, I said I didn't want her around him because it would normalize alcoholism but I've come to the realization that it's definitely because I'm mad at him.

My husband and mom have told me that I wbta because it could set him back further and I should let him be around her as long as he's sober in the moment. The thought of him holding her makes me sick. She's so special to all of us and I don't want a second of the time one of us could be spending with her wasted on him. They both know the decision is mine to make so I turn to those of you not emotionally invested to make the judgement.

It's worth mentioning that other than the drinking/things said and done while drinking he's been a good dad and husband.

He and my mother (50sF) split up when I was two years old after a several-year unhealthy relationship. Both brought new partners into my and their own lives over the years; it's definitely been complicated, but I haven't been bothered by it.

Most recently, dad had a relationship with Deb (50sF), who was really great for him. She was head over heels for him, talking about how good he was for her, especially after her own less-than-ideal relationships. Without getting too far into it, they had been together for about a year a few years back, split up over a fight for about year, and had gotten back together after for about two years. 

Over the holidays in the year they spent apart, dad and I visited Tina (50sF), who he had been considering dating. It became very apparent very quickly that Tina was not interested in a partner, but rather just having a big, loud guy to put her unruly children in their place, since their father wasn't in the picture. We spent the rest of the holiday trip visiting with dad's friend instead.

After we left and travelled back home, Tina started with really uncomfortable behavior. She messaged me constantly to get my dad to talk to her, changed her Facebook status to ""in a relationship"" after being blocked, insisting on sending him gifts as she already had our address, etc. I let him know what she had been posting because he couldn't see it, he spoke to her, and the behavior stopped soon after.

Fast forward to dad and Deb's (second) relationship. Deb and I chatted for a while after dad went to bed early one night. We ended up talking about the situation with Tina, and I shared with her how uncomfortable she had made me, and how poorly she had treated my dad. Deb nodded along and expressed her own disapproval of the situation, we started talking about something else, and eventually went to bed for the night. I didn't think anything else of it.

Dad confronted me the next evening with a text from Tina. Deb had sent her a horrific message about what I told her, and Tina texted dad, furious about it. He immediately blamed me, asking what we'd talked about the night before, accusing me of lying, saying he had been cheating on Deb, etc. Deb came into the room a moment later, and started shouting and cursing when she was asked about the text. A long walk and conversation later, Deb went to dad's room to start packing her things. Dad gave me the speech about how Deb wouldn't be visiting anymore, but I'm more than welcome to stay in touch with her, etc.

It's now been months, and dad still blames me. He says I had no right to tell Deb his ""personal business,"" but nothing of what I said made him look bad, or didn't directly involve me.

About 7 months ago a friend who I had cut ties with lost their partner in a car accident. Despite us not talking, I had previously tried to reopen communications since we had been extremely close beforehand. We stopped being friends due to an argument over spending time with other people and me giving too many second chances. 

When I found out about her partner passing, I contacted her mom to see how she was doing, and to see if she was seeing anyone at the time. Her mom told me that I was welcome to go and see her, which I did. I visited for about an hour, tried to talk to her about what she wanted to talk about, tried to do what I thought was best for her. After I left, I asked her mom about the funeral, and if it was okay if I went. She send me the information and told me where she would be there. I went with an acquaintance to the funeral. We sat in the back at the visitation, and we stood in the back during the burial. We only spoke to one other person we knew there. I thought that was that. I tried to speak to my old friend a bit more but she didn’t seem into it so I just let her alone. 

Fast forward a few months, and a coworker of me and my boyfriends is having a party. My boyfriend is invited but is told not to bring me because “people there don’t like me”. He does a little digging, and turns out, everyone has been told that I wasn’t supposed to go to the funeral, that I “crashed it” and that the person I went with was being disrespectful. I was..devastated. I can handle most rumors and ignore them. Someone saying I’m a whore, someone calling me an alcoholic, random shit, whatever. But saying I crashed a funeral is..vile. 

So we did our best to figure out where it was coming from. The main answer was said co worker who was having the party, and her girlfriend. So after some consideration, I made a group chat with both of them in it and sent them a message saying I didn’t know if the deceased persons girlfriend started the rumor or what, but that I had text evidence between me and her mom that it wasn’t true, and that they needed to stop spreading it. I didn’t cuss them out, didn’t call names, I just asked them to stop. 

They didn’t take it well. They called me a high schooler, told me nobody wanted to be friends with me because I was immature, and told me that they “didn’t spread anything” despite the only names I got back asking about who people heard it from was theirs. But either way, they’ve now text my boyfriend, text people at work, and made me out to be even more of a social pariah than I already was from the rumor. It’s like everyone has turned against me. I’m wondering if it was assholeish to accuse them of spreading it without solid evidence, but I didn’t know what else to do. I don’t want the reputation of “funeral crasher” to follow me around.

So, me (24m) and lets call her Beth (20s f) live in the same dorm and met in March/April, where we had a BBQ with some other students and it was basically a mix of welcoming new tenants and just a get together for the start of the semester.

We talked about games, enjoyed the same music and so on, numbers were exchanged and we met pretty much weekly for the evening and just chilled a bit, listening to each others spotify playlist and sometimes drunk a bit. Pretty casual stuff.

Semester coming to an end and she told me she would be visiting her parents. She also thought about what she was going to do since she will graduate next year. This was basically one of the last interaction we both had in person.

So vacation started and I texted her about every 2 or 3 weeks to which she didn't respond, stuff like ""how is it going?"", ""how did exams turn out?""etc.

Now we are about two weeks into new semester and I met one of her roommates on the way to my lecture. We talked a bit about our current curriculum and I asked ""Hey btw, is Beth still at her parents? She didn't respond to any messages.""

They told me they actually didn't know.

So another few weeks go by and we are now at the beginning of November. Now I feel a bit ignored, and since her shutters were up I go to her flat, nobody there. So going downstairs again and look who stands right in front of me, Beth.

Told her I saw the shutters were up and asked her what is going on. She just told me there was much to do and she also had some work to do on top of some university stuff. I asked if she wanted to hang out again once she has more time, to which she just said, something like ""yeah, much to do now with work but I will sent you a message"".

And here we are, texted her a few hours ago ""Hey, so how is work going?"".

She responded a few hours later and the gist was:

""You know, your last few messages are really creepy. It is also a huge red flag how you asked my roommate about me and then were in the building that one time. I am not interested in maintaining any kind of relationship""

I responded how shocked I was that she has that image of me, and that she could have just told me if she didn't want to hang out anymore. Also how I am not a stalker because I talk to people.

The thing is, I am more shocked than anything else about how I am apparently a creep or sending redflags. I thought of her as a really good friend, and then I suddenly get to know she thinks of me as someone to be scared of or something. I did not even send 10 messages over a span of months, and who wouldn't ask her roommate (whom I know btw) if they knew something? Maybe the meeting on the stairs was a surprise, but am I a stalker because of a coincedence?

Basically, yesterday morning I went to one of those big chain thrift stores to exchange an item I'd bought a week prior. A couple employees recognize me at this store, which is why I'm so worried about this since they'll know me if I shop there again. 

After finding some new clothes that I liked enough to exchange, I'd stopped in a corner to take out my old receipt to check if the price of this new item matched the price of my old item. When I say corner, though, it's in the widest aisle in the store so there's very high visibility.

A worker I’d never seen before came out of their stock room (about 10-15 ft away) just as I’d put my receipt back in my bag. She started calling out to me to get my attention, alerting nearby customers (two older ladies in the adjacent aisle and a younger woman in the same aisle). 

It pretty much went like this:

Her: What exactly are you doing over there in the corner? *(It sounds neutral typed out, but she said it very accusatory, so much so that I immediately understood that she thought I was stealing. I believe the other customers thought so, too, since they stared at me oddly the whole time - like the older ladies looked suuuper affronted by me)*

Me: Huh?

Her: What are you doing over there in your cart?

Me: I was checking an old receipt.

Her: No, you weren’t. You know that you don’t do that here. You do that at the front desk.

Me: Huh? (She said “you know,” like I knew, but I still have no clue what she meant by this)

Her: You’re not allowed to be in the corner like that. You have to stop.

I said something like, “oh, okay,” before walking away. She must’ve thought I'd put a store item in my bad and immediately called me out thinking I was stealing? I swear I didn’t put anything else in my bag but my receipt. 

I did my exchange at the front and left, but ended up returning. I spoke with one of their store managers about it, which is a first for me (I work in retail, so I know how it is). I just felt humiliated and thought it could’ve been handled it better. To me, it felt wrong that she'd accused me in front of other people and so loudly, too, so they all heard. I thought she could've walked up to me to ask, instead? It felt even more wrong because she had so little to go off of, seeing that she never actually saw what I’d put into my bag and it could’ve easily just been my phone or my wallet or what it actually was, which was my receipt.

I said I didn’t want to get their employee in trouble, so I guess there’s that, but I haven’t stopped wondering whether the employee even acted wrongly in the first place. She never outright said the word ‘stealing’ and I was in a corner where people must've stolen before.

Whenever we discuss having children, it always turns into some sort of debate. I mention how having children can be a good and great thing, and to retaliate she always brings up the negatives about having children, constantly saying its horrible and tiring and why it just wont be good for her. She also keeps mentioning how parents regret it almost as if shes expecting me to do the same. It turns into a fight, and we stop speaking to each other for a few days.

However, now i’m starting to have doubts because of her. What if she’s right and i regret having children? After another fight we had, i mentioned this to her and she got mad at me and told me its not her fault i cant think for myself (which isnt true). She called me a btch and told me to stop bringing the topic up if i dont like what she says.

We will call her alex (27f). We had all agreed that we were going to take it slow to see if poly was something I really wanted as james and Alex have been in poly relationships with others before.
Everything seemed to be going great me and James had just bought a house a few weeks prior to the relationship starting and alex helping us move in. Things started going down hill when alex started saying that we should change this about the house and we should do that about the house and that we can finish the basement that her room can be down there and that she was excited to move in, though we had never discussed her moving in with us other than before the relationship saying that our door was always open if she needed somewhere to stay if her current living situation ever fell through.
The conversations then started towards that we could all adopt kids together and that they would be our kids ( mine and James's on paper for medical stuff) and that we could just tell my family (who are pretty old school and religious) that she was just a live in nanny.
Then when I expressed that I was worried about how my parents would react to her living with us as they had thought in the past that james was cheating on me with her which he wasn't. And that I didn't know if I was or would ever be ready for all of us to be living together. Keep in mind we were only about 2 months into seeing each other. 
This led to alex spiraling because she said this ruined her plans for the next 10 years that now she didn't know what she was going to do and that she didn't know if she could trust us ever again because of this.
We all sat down at one point and tried to talk it out which just turned into her saying that we had couples privilege, which I get is an actual issue in poly relationships but I was new to it all and still learning. And every time I tried to explain how I was feeling I was shut down by alex and told that I didn't have the same life experience that she did.
During the times we sat down to talk it was also made clear that james and I were the ones in the wrong and that she was nothing but a victim in the whole thing. We had multipleconversations,about 3 or 4 of them and after each one had panic attacks, sever anxiety (feeling like james would leave me and this this whole situation was my fault)  and could hardly sleep which caused me to have to miss work because I can't run large equipment for 12 hours on 2 hours of sleep.

My bestfriend had just gone through a breakup around their year anniversary. My bestfriend wasn't taking it very well he had really shut people out and he was embracing all of the terrible personality traits his ex brought out in him. Me and a couple of our friends were trying to cheer him up and after a couple weeks while still obviously depressed he was staring to  properly socialize with people again. He seemed to be out of the worst of it but far from over her. 

I was doing my best to help him get over her and be the best friend that i could but then about a month after they broke up my childhood dog got severely sick she had kidney disease and she started having seizures well a week and $2500 in debt later she died in my arms.

I sent my bestfriend a message where i broke down and I begged him to just be there for me a hug 5 minutes of his time anything i don't remember exactly what was said or how the exchange went but i hit send and his reply was something along the lines of how he has to focus on himself after his break up. I replied ok.

I remember being so angry with him because I to this day have never been in so much pain and his message it hurt me so badly. Words cant explain how i felt i mean i wasn't broken it was like every atom in my body every molecule that makes me me just simultaneously gave up on life. I wanted to die so badly that I didn't eat or drink for a week. And I think alot of that pain was focused into anger because I don't remember ever being so mad in my entire life yet it was a calm angry like i hated everything that has ever been created but yet i was ok w it like i just stopped caring I was furious but I didn't have a fuck to give about it.

We have classes together, an in the last week we had to do a website and program some protocols in the computer, we only could do it in Monday and Wednesday, also, it was a group work and I made with Cait and Sara (another friend).

Monday I went to school but Cait was coming back from a trip so I just started doing the work with Sara, and then Cait said that when she came home she wanted to go out bc she was not feeling a good vibe alone, so with the teacher's permission, me and her went to the database class together on Tuesday.

In the end of the class i was feeling really tired and told her to just finish it with Sara on Wednesday, cause I was going to skip my class and focus on studying for an entrance exam that Im going to do, and she said like ""that’s fine” and I told her to send me an SMS if she and Sara needed any help.

What happens was that in Wednesday, our class just starts at one o'clock p.m and go until five o'clock, with a break at three o'clock, then at one o'clock I sent a message to her and asked how was the website going, she just send me things like ""okay"" and does not even told me NOTHING about the website, I was starting to worry about it bc I actually know better them Sara and Cait how to program but they were just both ignoring me, I even called them at the break time and until four o'clock I got NOTHING, SHE JUST ANSWERED ME BC I ASKED FOR A CLASSMATE to tell her to answer me.

I just got really nervous and then started to be a little mean saying like ""F\*\*k off all this bullsh@t could you F\*\*KING answer me???/, and then she came and said like ""Oh, I was full of stuff to do, the website went wrong and we just had to start it again"" I TOLD HER TO ASK ME FOR HELP IF SHE NEEDED IT, and she just disappeared, this work is worth most of the grade, and now we are basically on vacation, so I dont need to see her or nobody else again.

I just ignored everthing she told me in our chat and dont want to be around any off my ""friends"" never ever. AITA and should just at least apologize to her before completely isolating myself?

I (14F) was in my room rubbing one out. Usually, before I do this, I triple-check to see if my door is locked since I have family members that could potentially walk in. I lock it for the safety of everyone in my house and for privacy. I don't listen to music either when I do this, but that day I did, since my family members were being abnormally loud in the hallways and we have fairly thin walls.

While I was flicking it, I was on my phone (not calling anyone or taking pictures) and listening to music. All of the sudden, my door swings open. Turns out, my mom had been knocking on the door and I hadn't heard her, so she picked my lock. It's safe to say she was pretty pissed. I was extremely embarrassed, since she could clearly see what I was up to.

I wasn't trying to ignore her, I genuinely couldn't hear her AT ALL. I tried to explain the circumstances as to why I didn't hear her and open my door, but I was still punished even though she understood that I wasn't on the phone or taking pictures of myself.

To be fair, it wasn't a HARSH punishment, and she knows I'm *active* so I don't think she was shocked, but recently it's been awkward between us. I'm still pretty ashamed of the whole thing myself, too. 

Here is why I might be an asshole: Some may say I’m too young to have my door locked and some might say I’m too young to be active in that department, though for context: I am a sophomore in high school and sexual activities are fairly normal where I’m from and in high school in general+I have a late birthday.

I’m extremely conflicted which is why I’m posting this.

In the past our relationship was very strained because growing up she would freak out over minor things and scream. It really scared me and I feel like Im walking on eggshells around her. No one can tell what is going to set her off. when I mean minor things Its like forgetting a dish in the sink, or not moving quickly enough. It’s strange because a bigger problem (like breaking a piece of inventory) won’t set her off but moving something in a way she doesn’t like will. this is because she gets too stressed and then explodes but it still causes a lot of problems. 

I left with my husband on good terms in 2021 to pursue a new path with the idea that I would come back for the holidays. We got engaged and decided to have the wedding when we would be home.

Two days before the wedding I took 2 plastic flyer holders from the shop. I didn’t think they would be missed because they were behind the counter on the floor and They weren’t used often. We had also been using a lot of things from the shop for the wedding.

The night before my wedding my mom sent me texts that they had searched 30+ minutes for the sleeves. She said she wasn’t upset but that I needed to communicate better. When she came home. I made a joke that there was a fly in the room so they must have been talking about me. She went ballistic. She said I don’t love her, I always do sh*t like this, I’m selfish. All while I’m apologizing and crying. She stormed off and my partner consoled me. A minute later she came in and said “I do NOT want to fight with you tonight” while continuing to yell. I finally said that the reason I don’t tell her everything is that I’m scared of her and can’t tell what she’ll get mad about. She said “well if I did half the sh*t you did I’d be afraid of me too”. It was awful and I cried all night. I feel like I’ve always been so loyal to her and I do struggle with ADHD but I’m never trying to mess up her plans.

When I woke up I had bags under my eyes and a text from her that I should find a new officiant for my wedding (she was supposed to) luckily we had a great wedding but I’m always going to associate the 2. At the end of the night she apologized (rare event). But I can’t get over it and kind of shrugged her off. 

The next day we woke up, went back to the house, packed up and left. We planned on staying for another month. I’m not wanting to “run away from my problems” but at the same time I feel her reaction was uncalled for.

I work from about 7:30am till about 5-6pm Monday to Friday and because of the nature of my work, sometimes Saturday mornings. Despite the hours, feel like I have a good work/life balance and really enjoy what I do. 

My boyfriend (31m) of 7 years works from about 8-9am till around 4-6pm most days. We are very equal, he does about 50% of the housework and split costs 50/50. We make a great team most of the time. He works in an office space in the city we live in, around 10 minutes from our house, but the office is right across the road from the supermarket so he often walks there during lunch to get stuff that we need for the house. 

He got cranky at me this morning and he left for work after we got into a small argument because I ‘never go to the shops and never leave the house to get supplies we need’ and I am always asking him to get things that we need. I do leave the house a couple of times a week for things to be picked up, or jobs to be done, but he doesn’t see this and if I have picked something up, I’m not usually going to announce it because I don’t think it is necessary to. Granted, I do ask him to go to the shops or run an errand more often than I do myself, but my thinking on this is that I am not leaving the house, he is already right across the road from the shops and he often goes there anyway. 

I see why this would annoy him so I am trying to be better about it and leave the house more often to do whatever jobs need doing but I just don’t see the point in actively leaving the house when I am working or after a big day of work when he is already driving home and so much closer to the shops than I am. Are we clashing because we are so 50/50 on everything and this is just what we are used to?

Above me I have a Middle Manager (MM) and his supervisor is the Upper Boss (UB).  UB does the production scheduling for my department.  UB is on vacation this week and MM took over scheduling.  MM fucked up and we are going to short our customer next week.  I know this because I read updates from our logistics department, MM doesn't always look.  I can also read and interpret the data better than MM can.  So maybe he did look but didn't understand it.   

I noticed the error in the first few hours of the day but decided to let it go for a few reasons:  First, I am currently covering for a person under me that is on vacation so I am doing his job and barely doing mine.  Second, my team had already moved on to the next task.  Going back to the last task would have delayed production, pissed off a lot of people, and would have turned a 9-10 hour day into a 12-13 hour day the day before Thanksgiving.  Third, not only should MM have caught the mistake, but someone in the logistics department should have.  Its just not my job.  Fourth, (OK...full disclosure here) I don't like MM and I want him to get fired so I can take his job.  I take on extra responsibility, I learn as many things about as many jobs as I can, I get to know as many people as I can in all areas of the shop and what they do so I can always get the right answers from the right people as quickly as possible.  UB has mentioned several times he trusts and counts on me far more than others at the lower level manger position.  I take the initiative and exceed expectations at every opportunity while MM sits there like a turd.

I honestly felt like I was in an ethical dilemma.  I wanted to bring up the mistake so we could meet the customers demand.  But I am so tired of being better at MM's job than he is without any recognition.

A few weeks after the invitations went out I hadn’t heard from her so I asked if she was coming. She said she would let me know but really acted like she couldn’t come bc it was too late at night for her (8pm) to go out after work (she has a stressful work situation and likes to leave at 5 and be in bed by 8.) For the past 16 years anytime she said she’d let me know if she was coming to something, it always ended up being a no. Though I understand her situation at work I was hurt that she wouldn’t break her routine for this very important event. She’s had a tough time with family things and mental health lately and I have gone way out of my way to be here for her. This was one way I really needed her to be here for me. I face timed her to tell her how much it would mean to me for her to be there. I was visibly upset and holding back tears. She showed no emotion and kept saying how it’s just late and work is stressful. 

I cried all week over this. Turns out she was trying to surprise me?? She showed up at my event. I was thrilled that she was there. She mentioned to my mom and husband how funny it was that she surprised me and they said they were happy she came but that the way she chose to surprise me had hurt me quite a bit—and that that probably wouldn’t be the best way to surprise me in the future. Honestly it felt kinda heartless to me - like how can you see your best friend be so upset and think it’s a fun surprise?

A month later-today-she called to tell me she needed to get something off her chest. She has been upset that my family spoke to her and she said they told her she wasn’t prioritizing me enough and she said “they told me how they feel about me.” Which is just not true. I said no one is upset with you. I’m very grateful that you came and so are they. 

I tried to help her understand why her actions put me on an emotional roller coaster. She said she apologizes for the way I took it. Basically an “I’m sorry you feel that way” which I don’t perceive as an actual apology. She said there’s no reason I should have thought she wouldn’t come. I said the reason is I took her at her word - why would I assume she was pretending?

She is acting like a victim and twisting other people’s words to paint her picture. This, along with some other things she’s done lately, are really making me think she has some type of personality disorder. Unless…I’m TA???
