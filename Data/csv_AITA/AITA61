Basically, I see a video of his where he says ""If you agree with me on this, but you draw the line here, then you're still a (insert insult)"" 

I thought this was a bit much.

Everyone in the comments just blindly agreed, so i offered simple statements of disagreement. 

To my surprise my comments actually caught his attention and he started responding to me. Unfortunately it was not in a good way and he was still throwing insults at me for disagreeing but acting as if it was all okay because to him it was just ""facts."" 

He claimed to have heard all of my arguments before and that I've done nothing to dissuade him, and only reinforced his opinion. I was a little taken aback because to me I hadn't really commented any real argument I had at that point, because it was an Instagram comment section and I could only dive in so much.

I tried explaining to him that I'm actually a fan, I just have a disagreement with him on this one thing, and also that I did find it a little disappointing that he would just label someone like me as he was doing. He didn't like that and his reasoning was that, ""you may be acting nice about it, but by drawing this line you're actually supporting all the bad people and so you're all equal to blame."" I know from personal experience that the ""others"" that he was referring to do not agree with me. I tried pointing that out to him but it did not matter, or was not worth addressing to him.

When I finally got to trying to illustrate my perspective and why this issue is important to me personally, he proceeded to dismiss everything and claim he had heard my story more times than he could count and that I'm still a (insult). 

Almost every response he made I kept having to correct the things he was assuming incorrectly.

The only thing he would say that illustrated an ounce of empathy was ""oh, i know it's hard when you're smart enough to see your views are problematic.""

He was done with ""explaining it to me over and over"" so at that point I let out my frustration and called him out on his hypocrisy for having absolutely nothing at stake in this debate, playing the savior, but also being just like any other typical arrogant male who will condescend to a woman who doesn't 100% agree with him. 

I'm not proud of insulting him in such a way, but he had literally been throwing the same insults at me all day and refused to see my side of it.

3 of my friends and I got together yesterday to play a 2v2 game. I showed up at the hosts house a little early this time, and after about an hour and a half.  our other friend hadnt shown up. Thats when he accidentally let slip that he and his girlfriend had lied about the start time and told me a time 2 hours earlier. I'm usually about 30 mins late.

We helped each other through breakups, laughed until we couldn't breathe, shared our hardest and deepest secrets with one another, survived an extremely toxic trio friend group, I was there when his dad died, and more. Over this past summer we hung out and texted all the time, and we've never really grown apart.

When we started this school year, we were closer than ever before. But after about 3 weeks, he completely ghosted me. He didn't call me, text me, talk to me in the hall, and would purposefully not even look at me during our one and only class together. After a couple weeks I finally texted and confronted him. I asked if he didn't want to be friends anymore and he said yes. That was fine, but what I was so upset about was why. He said that he...

1. Didn't have a reason to be friends with me anymore
2. The only reason he talked with me was because he talked to my other best friend and that would make him talk to me too
3. He was uncomfortable with me and was more comfortable/related to more with a different group of friends he had recently made
4. Didn't want to put effort into a relationship that was going to fall apart anyways

I understand some of these reasons, but it still made me upset. I accepted it anyways, said thank you for telling me, and moved on.

Until I was told that just a few days after he broke it off he was telling people I was an asshole, got mad because he stopped giving me attention, thought the world revolved around me, and that I had zero friends. I finally caved and sent a paragraph telling him how hurt and mad I was. I told him I knew he had been lying to me about talking to a toxic person who hurt me, that he had bullshit reasons for dropping me, that I knew the rumors he was spreading about me, the audacity he had to not even acknowledge me and then get offended when I was upset, and that throughout our friendship he would say and do fucked up things just to justify it with ""well I have ADHD"" or ""I have PTSD I can't help it"". I told him that I wasn't a perfect friend either, but what i had to put up with over the past 4 years was too much now and I wouldn't stand back and watch him lie to other people or me anymore. (He had a history of lying to people for fun, but there's too much to cover here).

It's been a couple months now, and I still feel bad about it. After saying he's a bad person for dropping me and almost invalidating his ADHD and PTSD I feel that I overreacted and he didn't deserve that.

The wedding planning has been a smooth process and we've had no issues until late last week. I invited a friend (N) from school, we've been friends for 12 years and have drifted apart due to life. She has always been quiet and not one to open up much, but Ive witnessed her unwavering support for the lgbtq+ community numerous times. N got into a relationship about 4 years ago and had a baby with the man (L) last year. I met L at her baby shower and he seemed decent until I noticed some things, such as complaining that his son will not be using a pink colored teething ring and that the gender neutral clothing looked too 'girly', and that he answered quite a few questions for N, stared her down and would white knuckle her knee every time she tried to give a different answer. I wholeheartedly believe she is being abused, because she is so quiet and doesnt stand up for herself.

The main issue is that my gay sister and a few of my gay/bisexual cousins and friends are in my wedding party, and L does not like that. They (mostly L) called me last week to let me know how disrespectful it was to god that Ive allowed ""the homos to infiltrate a sacred god ordained union"". I laughed and hung up. N called me some hours later when she was alone and apologized for L's behavior, but told me she cant do anything about that. I asked her if she truly felt the way about my wedding that L claimed she did, and she sat quiet for about a minute before she laughed a bit and let an I dont know slip out of her mouth. I let her know that because of recent events regarding the lgbtq community here in Colorado I will be protecting my family and friends by not taking any chances, and therefore she and L are uninvited from my wedding. If anyone is wondering how they found out about my family being lgbtq+, me and fiance started a large group chat of friends/family to get to know eachother, and a few relatives have shocked me by their vitriolic contempt for the lgbt community, so they have been uninvited as well for safety, and fiance agrees. 

A few mutual friends are calling me an asshole and unreasonable for what Ive done, because we've all seen N's support for the community firsthand, and we've all seen the manipulative behavior from L and know she is possibly being abused.

Me and my older siblings has a good relationship with each other. We share the same hobbies and interests. Our youngest sister 23(f) is the complete opposite she’s not very active and does like to create things either. I think she presents how close the rest of us are to each other. When me and each of my older siblings got married we included all of our siblings in our wedding party including our youngest. We didn’t make her pay for anything involving our wedding. 
During our weekend Bachelor and bachelorette party we all had activities planed 10 activities in total per party five for us to enjoy and five she picked her self (again we didn’t make her pay for her part so we funded it). It was still a nightmare everything was planed for when it came to our activities it was almost as soon as we would get their she would asked if we could leave yet the whole time making these exaggerative sounds. But as soon as it came to her activities we spend hours their almost missing our time spot for the next activity. So after my wedding me and my older siblings decided that when she finally got married we would not participate in her wedding party we would still attend as regular guest.
Now here comes last weekend we here from our mom she engaged we didn’t even know she was dating but again we weren’t Close. We planned to go to our sister engagement party if she asked to be a part of a bridal party we were going to politely turn her down but if she didn’t even mention a bridal party we weren’t going to say anything either. We get to the restaurant the party being held at and can feel something is off from our sister friends and fiancé and his family. We ask our parents and they felt it too. Well about 20mins past and my sister calls everyone attention to her. 
She asked for me and the rest of our siblings to come forward so we did I noticed her fiancé holding her hand and a woman I assumed to be your best friend holding her other one I guessed for support. She started how she know we must have been hoping to be apart of her wedding party but she didn’t want that because of how can you go did she felt being a part of ours. But hoped we could pay because it was only right to pay back what she had payed towards our. I know me and my siblings are so a like because we didn’t get mad we all broke out into laughter. I told her you know we got pictures of the activities we did with you right and the receipts proving that she paid nothing so we left.
We found out the aftermath later out parents and our side of the family said unless she apologizing to us that there are boycotting the wedding her fiancé‘s parents relationship with her has turned sour because they see her as a liar and only a handful of her friends are sticking by her side. They our the one calling and harassing us telling us to fix this some telling me how down bad she is and it’s getting to me.

This happened on the 12th of Nov.

In my little brother's room, (he's a toddler) we have a baby monitor system. There are lights, voice communication, Remote TV, and an alarm that wakes the whole house up in an emergency. (Crazy, I know.) 

My little brother's sleep schedule is the following: He wakes up at 9:00 or 8:00 AM. He has a premade breakfast, then he plays a little, watches a mind of television, plays with he's sister or brother. (Never me or some reason.) And then he will go to bed at 7:00 PM.

**The story is the following:**

One day, while I'm out on a Saturday, I tune into the app to see my brother since he wakes up at this time. I see him standing in he's crib bouncing around. I don't want him climbing or crawling out.

I call my sister, but she doesn't answer after three calls. She never does this, and I was scared she might have been in a bad situation. I think of ways to do wake her.

I turn on the lights and tell my little brother to stay put. Then, I set off the quieter but still loud alarms in the kitchen to awaken her.

I don't have access to her room whatsoever, so I start talking through the kitchen to tell her about my little brother.

She heats up a premade meal, gives it to my brother. She calls me back and we talk about it. She was upset because I ""woke her up from a good dream"". (she's like 16) I tell her I thought it was something bigger than a ""good dream"".

My parents think we're just bickering, but my dad did make me uninstall the security app. This makes me think IATA. My mother and other siblings kept out of it.

Luckily, she lives a state over so we don't see her a lot, but she still finds a way to annoy the crap out of me.

Things like making passive aggressive comments about my personality so she looks ""cooler"", trying to show me up (she once bought the same dress I wore to graduation and posted photos of her more done up in it), and consistently trying to get between us (she likes to call my bf with ""emergencies"" during date nights and special events like when I met his parents for the first time).

I've been able to deal with it, but this past weekend was the last straw for me. To celebrate our anniversary, my boyfriend and I made reservations at a local Italian restaurant where you can book a special event celebration (they have an Italian singer serenade you with a special dessert, champagne, etc.). 

Lo and behold, Emily said that she would be in town that weekend and wanted to see my bf. I said no, but my boyfriend said that she rarely visits and it would mean a lot. So I said fine, but dinner was just us. Even if they saw each other in the afternoon, I didn't want her to come to dinner. 

I had to meet my boyfriend at the restaurant because of work and I almost freaked on site because EMILY WAS STANDING THERE WITH MY BOYFRIEND. I cannot even explain how pissed I was. Apparently Emily was aallll booked up that weekend except the exact time period I had dinner reservations, and my boyfriend said that Emily flew soooo far so it would be rude to not see her while she was visiting. 

So here's where I could have been an AH: I privately told our waitress that I was my bf's sister and we were celebrating him and Emily's anniversary. Because he *obviously* cared about her so much and she was trying to hard to play the part of the girlfriend, why not really lean into it? 

The singer came out and they did the whole thing in front of the entire restaurant, and when the waitress and singer egged them on to kiss, my bf and Emily awkwardly said that they weren't the couple, and Emily excused herself to the bathroom while kind of crying. 

My boyfriend and I had a total blow out fight in the parking lot. We ended up breaking up. I called him an AH for putting Emily first, but he called me an AH for not communicating with him like an adult and embarrassing him in front of an entire restaurant.

I (15 almost 16) am the eldest child in an upper middle class family, with my mom (early forties), my dad (about the same age as mum), and my younger siblings (13m and 12f). I go to boarding school, so I am away from home for a lot of the year, but I do spend a lot of of time at home. My mothers side of the family has a lot of ADHD, autism, dyslexia, etc, and both me and my brother are autistic. I got lucky and pass as nt really well, but my brother does not. My mom recently told me she doesnt think he’ll be able to go to college or hold down a job.

One of my main problems is I have anger issues (i used to lash out physically all the time) and am very possessive and need my space. My brother has a history of stealing. I have two boxes of comics that he would take from me and i would find months later crumpled and dirty under his bed. This was years ago, but felt I should mention. He also steals my legos (I dont really play with them, but i adore building big lego sets) he would break the sets i spent hours on and lose pieces. Lastly he has also stolen cash from me and my dad and my dads credit card.

One of our big conflicts is that I have a really low social battery, and he has a really high one, as well as being very socially draining. As hes gotten older he gets madder at me when I ask him to leave me alone, says I’m just making excuses and starts shouting at me. Ive asked my parents to put a lock on my door for years but they’ve said no. I LOVE MY PARENTS, they are wonderful and understanding, i am so lucky to have them.

I also have super bad anxiety (i finally got an appointment to talk to my doctor about) and have mild second hand trauma that I have been unable to speak to a therapist about, which makes me shut down when people start shouting at me. really bad combo with my anxiety.

I mostly want to put a lock on my door because my possessions (lot of art supplies) are getting more expensive if I needed to replace them. even if my brother doesnt take them he leaves the door open whenever he goes into my room and my cats could get into them. my parents have tried talking to him before about it but my sister is the only nt one in the family so theyre a bit scatterbrained, which i do not blame on them. though a few years ago while i was at school my siblings got into my room, took some really pretty makeup glitter stuff, and scattered it all over my room because they wanted to pretend it was pixy dust. my sister was the one who told me about it when i got back and noticed the glitter all over my stuff. whenever anyone confronts my brother about something (he lies a lot) he digs his heels in and if you press, or even give evidence, he starts shouting at you.

I've only met with her BF once at that time, and I didn't get good vibes from him, but I still wanted to offer to buy tickets for her and her BF because I thought it'd be fun to go with her and I just wanted to be nice. After going through a very brutal ticket-buying process (ew Ticketmaster), I managed to secure tickets for all three of us and we were all really excited.

So I am (31f) Lisa and my friend is a (36f) Becks. We have been friends for a very long time. Before she met this guy (Jason) we go out every weekend and try to meet guys. She would alwys be the one to take it to far and end up in cars, hotel rooms and even getting herself lost once in a while. It was fun for a while. One night we were hanging out with a bacholor party and I ended up hooking up with a married man. Very goodlooking and very good in bed. I started to see him on the weekends and Becks would always pass judgement on me for being with a married man. He stated that his divorce is almost final. I really got tired of Becks telling me to leave him and I did after a month of dating him.

This brings us to today. After a few months of clubbing, Becks is now head over heals for this guy WHO IS MARRIED! After only knowing him for about 3 months they decided to move in together. She does have a few hang ups with him. He has a child from his CURRENT MARRIAGE and she is always complaining that she hates it when his son Jake hangs around on the weekends taking away time from them being together. I have told my friend exactly what she was telling me when I was dating a married man. You should probably leave him because he is married.

That's fine, except after a bit she said she wanted to get married to him. 

This didn't sit well with my parents and I didn't think it was a good decision either. We felt she was too young to get married and should focus on her studies/career, and she was also attending an Ivy school (and his background too). Jane had a huge fight, went off saying she can do both and they're going to get married. My parents chalked it up to Jane trying to be a rebellious teen and maybe kind of jealous of me, and honestly none of us expected this relationship would last long. They eventually told Jane she can ruin her life if she wishes, but they don't want anything to do with it. Jane and her husband ended up getting married when she was 20. 

None of us kept in contact for about a year, but I dmed Jane and she'd reply back, so we kept in touch occasionally. I assumed she'd dropped out of college or something, but she actually ended up graduating with decent grades, and was offered a good job.

Last year Jane told me she was pregnant. I told my parents (yes she said I could) and they wanted to get in regular contact with her. 'Regular contact' ended up being a couple of visits because Jane didn't want more, and my niece was born in January. Unfortunately, her husband passed a few months ago.

Okay now- my parents invited Jane to our Thanksgiving dinner this year, and she accepted. She was upset obviously, and made small conversation but opened up a bit as well. Mom made an offhand comment to Jane, something like 'are you out of your phase now' and 'do you understand we just wanted to look out for you'. 

She got really mad, saying it was a mistake to ever come here and made a big scene. I tried to comfort her and said it was just mom looking out for her, but she left after.

He said he helps me when I need it all the time (takes out my dog, does the trash, pays for our dates etc) and it’s just this one thing that he needs help with.

The one year we couldn’t go my MIL went by herself and sat on Santa’s lap while holding photographs of our kids. That was her passive aggressive way of telling us how disappointed she was that we didn’t make the event happen for her).
    This year my children are 10 and 12 years old. They don’t believe in Santa and they never enjoyed this tradition to begin with. They always tolerated visiting Santa for Grandma’s sake but they always felt shy and nervous to sit on Santa’s lap. This year they BEGGED us to not see Santa. They tearfully told us they don’t want to see him because they feel awkward and embarrassed about the whole thing. They said if it was really important to Grandma they’d do it for her but asked if we could skip it. 
   My husband and I explained all this to my MIL and suggested that we start a new Christmas tradition like Christmas tree shopping or seeing the Nutcracker together. We explained that the kids really don’t feel comfortable visiting Santa and we’d like to do something they would enjoy.

We started to plan while at my aunt’s house, where my cousin lives with her kids. Now I don’t like big parties, I don’t like crowded places (thank you covid) and I have hearing problems to where the smallest amount of noise can give me chronic headaches.

Anyways, the one thing I’ve always wanted to do for a birthday for the longest time was to go to build a bear. Yes it’s dumb but we were never able to go there for a birthday because it’s been expensive, but with my job I could pay for it. They said that was fine and we could go to dinner afterwards. Now this year my birthday is on a Tuesday, so my cousin’s kids would be in school. With hearing this, my cousin intervenes.

We’ll call her “Kim”

Kim : “so when are we doing this? My kids would love to go”

Me : “oh, we’ll be having on my birthday still, Tuesday is pretty empty”

Kim, seeming frustrated looked at my mom, who is a suck up to her. Despite my cousin being 30.

Kim : “Can we have it on a Saturday? My kids will be so upset if they can’t go”

Me, getting frustrated because this happens every year : “no, I don’t want to be there when it’s loud and kids are screaming. Plus I just want it to be my Boyfriend and me.”

Kim : “Build a bear is a kids place, I’m sure it will be loud no matter the day. Just go somewhere else.”

At this point I’m tearing up because I’m HORRIBLE at speaking up for myself, so I just got up and left the house out to my dad’s car. Later my dad came out and to my surprise he agreed that I should be able to have a calm birthday with boyfriend and no children.

My mom thinks otherwise, she thinks my cousin is correct that it’s a kid’s place and if I want it to be quite on birthday I should go somewhere else. Or to invite my cousin’s kids. Who are not disciplined at all.

My friend lives 10 minutes closer so he's been asking me to meet at his place and leave my car there so he doesn't have to drive 10 minutes in the opposite direction to pick me up before making the 4 hour drive.

I understand his reasoning, it makes sense, however we both like to drink and smoke weed, and obviously the person driving can't do that. When I am driving he doesnt have to worry about drinking or smoking to much and he also doesnt have to worry about sobering up.

When its his turn to drive I have to make sure I am sober to drive that last 10 minutes, which always results in me drinking earlier than I want to, drinking less than I want to, and I have to stop drinking sooner than Id want to, all because I have to make sure I am sober that last little 10 minute drive.

I get his reasoning, it makes total sense, but I still feel its unfair. I would be totally fine doing that 10 minute drive if we were staying sober, but we are not.

I understand that no matter what there will be an unbalance here, either he has to go 10 minutes out of his way to pick me up and drop me off, which in total would add around 40 minutes to his drive, or I have to drive a little bit too, which sorta ruins the DD aspect of us rotating drivers.

I (23F) have been with my bf (23M) for a few weeks, but have been friends with him for 5 years. He plays a lot of games online, and has pulled me into some of them. A few months ago (about 2 or 3) he met a group of people online that he really likes. Long story short he pulled me into multiple games with them, and each time negative comments were made to/about me. 

On one occasion a minor said “shut the fuck up, we are playing a game and I can’t hear” after yelling and giggling loudly for 45 minutes prior (me being silent the whole time). He defended them later by saying it didn’t mean much because they are a minor and didn’t know any better. 

A second occasion, a few of them said “well, __(me)___ is going to A so let’s all just go to B. If she dies we know they are over there.” He chose to go mid but didn’t say anything about the comment. Later when I brought it up, he said that it was okay because they are just kinda toxic like that. 

Both incidents made me severely upset. When brought up to my now bf, he defended them and tried to brush it off. My problem is that he defended them on every occasion something would happen and tell me about how happy he is playing games with them. I’m trying to get over all incidents, but something about it still sits really wrong with me. I know I wasn’t dating him when it happened, so it feels like I’m not allowed to be upset by it.

At IHOP, my friend pulled out a tamagotchi. They told us that they'd purchased a Demon Slayer themed Tamagotchi. They went on to say that they now found it to be annoying and asked if any of us wanted it.

I gladly accepted it, as I had always wanted one.

I loved this tamagotchi so much. I'd even go as far to say that I was more attached to her than some of the people in my life. I even put her on the shelf next to my bed at night.

However, I washed my hands and got water on her.

After the necessary steps, she was okay. I vowed that I would never get her wet again.

One day, before fifth period started, me and my best friend went to the bathroom together and we were okay being late. I put my tamagotchi right behind the faucet to protect her, and my friend remembered that she had to work with a partner and she couldn't leave them by herself, so we rushed out of there, and I accidentally left my tamagotchi.

I was tired that day and didn't realize until I was on the bus, and she wasn't.

This leads me to today. I had expressed interest in the past in getting a tamagotchi to my parents, and I think I said a gen1 at some point, but I had changed my mind afterwards and never told them. 

Money is really tight right now, so my birthday party is pushed off until later in the year and I blew up at my mom. I strongly regret that, as I know she's doing everything she can for us.

Yesterday was my birthday, but I didn't get my presents until today. My sister ordered two things off of my Amazon wishlist, some really cute hairclips and a bunny phone holder. My parents, however, got me a gen1 tamagotchi. 

I have a history with compulsive lying. I've been getting better but it slips. It got to the point that nobody can tell I'm lying.

My mom asked if I liked it, I lied and she went on to say how grateful she was that I was happy, because it was an expensive present and she was really worried I wouldn't like it, and she knew how bad I felt after loosing my other one.

But I do dislike it. I might even hate it. I don't like the shape or feel to it, the characters are ugly, and the controls are weird and confusing, even with the instruction manual. 

And the worst part is she asked again later when she came to say goodnight and I still lied. 

I feel awful, and I don't know what to do. I know I might be too old to still own toys, but my mom has never shamed me for stuff like that. She's always been so supportive of me, even when I was an annoying preteen. I love my mom, and I lied to her.

My family and I have always been close, we always loved each other and always would arrange family gatherings. A while ago I became pregnant with my husbands baby and my family and my husband were super supportive and helped me out a lot.   


At 20 weeks me and my husband hosted a gender reveal and found out it was a baby girl. Everybody was very excited after we found out the gender of the baby. However me and my family got into arguments about the baby's name. My family wanted her to be named Betty after my grandmother who passed away 2 years ago. I refused and said I am not naming my child Betty and stated I wanted to name her Diana (after my fathers great-grandmother). My dad was the only one supportive of this and said it was my choice and Diana was a lovely name.   


My mother came in and said it was selfish to name my child after my fathers great-grandmother but not name my child after my grandmother. I told my mother I never liked my grandmother because she was always rude to me and never supported me. Me, my dad, and my husband are very upset over what the family has been saying. 1 week later I wasn't invited to my brothers going away party because he was moving to London. My aunt said it was because I was being selfish and rude.   


Fast forward my daughter was born and I told my dad not to let my mom go to the birth of my child. My husband and dad went and supported me. My family then later asked me if i could meet the baby, I agreed because I didn't want to be rude. After I told them I named her Diana they won't stop shooting me dirty looks. My mother even thinks i'm very selfish for not letting me go to the birth of my child. I told her I wanted her to go but after the way shes been treating me I was upset.

I recently met this guy through a dating site because I think it’s kind of funny to see what all of the LVM are up to, but he was surprisingly different from how I had expected. He was polite and never asked me about my weight, anything inappropriate etc. We chatted back and forth for a few days (he responded to me immediately and I usually gave him an hour or two but he never mentioned this, don’t know if it’s worth mentioning here) and finally after a week he asked me if I would go out on a date with him. Well, I told him no at first because I was worried he might be low value like everyone else I seemed to have dated before, and that worried me because he’s significantly younger than me (27). He asked again later and idk why I even said yes but I did and I was honestly pleasantly surprised.  He was a perfect gentleman. He looked exactly how he did on his profile, he drove a nice car and had a pretty good job for someone just starting their career. His clothes weren’t wrinkled and he clearly took the time to style his hair and look good for me. He took initiative and planned the date out, even taking me to a nice restaurant (that I mentioned I liked before in our previous conversations) and told me I looked beautiful. I know LVM use flattery to get you to like them but it really didn’t feel that way. After the date, he offered to drive me home and I don’t know what I was thinking but I really wanted to go home with him so I did.  He lived in one of those townhouse type places so I already wasn’t really sure about it but the inside was decorated just to my taste and he seemed like he really cared about me. He asked if I wanted to watch a movie with him so I did and he let me pick it out off of his Netflix account. While we were watching though, one thing kind of led to another admittedly and I found out he has breasts.  I don’t have anything against trans people but this just really freaked me out because if he’s lying about that what else is he lying about? Is he still a HVM and is it worth perusing this relationship with him??? Do I deserve better?? God I don’t know what to do.

For some context, my mom has a job that she only goes to about twice a month, so she is home all of the time. However, while at home she sleeps until noon/1pm everyday, walks the dog, and sometimes does something, maybe she vacuums or maybe she loads the dishwasher.

However the house is regularly a mess. And to be honest, I don't mind that. What I mind is that she throws a tantrum about it not being clean enough to have anyone over or decorate. Complete with shouting, slamming things, storming off etc.

My brother, dad and I all work blue collar jobs 5-7 days a week, 8-12 hours a day. When we get home, we are tired, we just want to rest.

And I'm not saying we don't do anything, we all do our own laundry, I load the dishwasher when I can, and always do it on weekends as well as clean the kitchen, my brother does the garbage everyday, and my dad cooks some nights.

But my mom... she has all day to do one or two tasks and she just doesn't do it. Everyday I call her on my way home because there is a 70% chance there is no dinner, and I just get something on my way home for everyone.

Now she is threatening to not decorate for Christmas until I, specifically, dust the house for her. Which again, I don't mind doing, but tell me before you have a fit about it. How am I supposed to know what you want me to do?

So tomorrow I am waking up an hour early to dust before work, because I know I'll be too tired afterwards to do it.

And she complains about her sleeping schedule, and this drives me nuts. She sleeps from 1/2am until noonish, then complains she has no time because the day is half over and that she can't fall asleep.

I think it would be easy to correct with just some consistency but she sleeps randomly throughout the day too. But she just can't do that either. And I wouldn't care about her sleeping habits if it didn't become an excuse for her that she refuses to fix.

And as for messiness, my brother and I both have almost everything of ours in our bedrooms, out of the way except for our work jackets, boots, hats and lunchboxes, which we use everyday.

My dad can be a bit messy, but it isn't anything outside the norm. Leaving bills/mail out, a coffee cup, maybe a paper plate out, etc.

So, I get frustrated with her, when she sleeps all day and then gets mad at us for not doing housework even though she is home all of the time. She doesn't even have a hobby or anything to take up her schedule.

I've never talked back to my parents before, and I would never want to seem ungrateful or disrespectful but... it's hard to not get frustrated.

I've been in the club since sixth grade, but my attendance was awful in tenth grade because of hybrid learning and being overwhelmed with everything. I ran for vice president and/or president, but I bombed my presentation, so I didn't get any votes. Instead, T (16NBY) did. T prepared a presentation that I admit was good, but T has a pretty lengthy history of being snarky to others that made me worry about their ability to engage with our community. We're a low-income community; T used to talk down about our school's theater program when we're significantly worse off than the school they came from and assumed I didn't know anything about theater despite having been involved in the program since I was around eight years old. Apparently stretching my legs when I won't be on stage the entire rehearsal is ""unprofessional"" (despite the fact I got the okay from both directors of the musical to do so). I'm pretty sure that was because of their views on our school and the people who go here. They act like if you're anything less than a rich kid who can afford to dye their hair bright colors every month and buy trendy clothes, you're an idiot. T also has a history of being offensive. One event that sticks out in my mind was the time they called my best friend a transphobic slur within thirty? minutes of knowing her (before they even knew they were nonbinary) and when she asked them to stop they said it was ""just a friendly nickname"". I didn't vocalize my concerns after the election because I didn't want to seem bitter, nor did I want to out my friend (who is out to people in her life but not many kids at this school- she's moved schools since then), and the president of the club endorsed T for vice president.

&amp;#x200B;

We've had some events since T was elected and T didn't show up to any of them. Their schedule was never busy beforehand. At one event where I was one of the only people to man the counter, T walked right past us, knowing we were going to be there. After our next meeting, my aunt talked about T to me. T doesn't hand in any of their assignments (they take intensive classes) and hasn't been doing anything, etc etc. I think she needed to get it all off her chest because this is her first time running the club.

&amp;#x200B;

My aunt said I would become vice president if T kept failing to show up. I said, ""that seems unfair, why don't we do an election between me and the other person who lost instead or be co-VPs?"". I'm not sure how much my aunt really bought into my idea. Another student who happened to be in the room agreed I would be a better VP than T, but I'm worried the situation could come across like my aunt is going to kick T out of the position solely so I can be VP. I really don't want that to happen because it would breed resentment in the club. I don't want drama getting in the way of helping people.

I have been stuck with an acquaintance / casual friend that is objectively a mean person and has emotionally damaged a few people on campus since my freshman year, because she used to be close friends with my former roommate, and now I'm afraid to cause conflict with her by trying to distance myself, so instead I am being civil and putting up with her only at parties and large events. 

My close friend, (19) is a Sophomore, and has never been harmed by this person directly, but has heard stories about how she's bad, and even though my friend has never spoken to this person, believes they know better than I do what kind of person she is.

(as if ""the freshmen"" care at all what i think about anything?) 

However, i think it's not ok for my close friend to tell me who else i can and can't hang out with, and to try to make me feel guilty for posting pictures on my Instagram, of all things.

Luke's brother and Chrissy have lived together for 6 years now, and while we've speculated they could be more than roommates, they claim that's all they are. They each have their own separate rooms in the house. When we interact with them publicly, the two of them almost seem to avoid each other, his brother almost ignoring his roommate altogether. And in photos, Luke's brother puts his arm around Chrissy but hovers his hand above her shoulder to avoid touching her. It's so strange.

However, they do just about everything together from eating out each night to taking weekend trips (sleeping in separate beds in the same hotel room) and even doing holidays at one-another's family houses.

And thats basically the entirety of what we ended up doing, but I'll get to that in a bit. Obviously, my parents paid for the tickets. That was expected since my mom limits the amount of money I can have access to (the rest she's made me put in a beneficiary fund), but I did have some spending money at least. My younger siblings, twins, told me that my mom said I didn't have to hang out with them, and could just do my own thing. I don't mind that, especially when I hear that they are buying food passes for the day. That means I won't even have to worry about food. I mention doing my own thing and my mom guilt trips me, saying that I'm awful for not wanting to spend the day with my family. I just tell her I must have misunderstood the twins and assume it's over with. Wrong. When we get to Busch Gardens, they go to order the meal passes, but my mom tells me if I want one, I have to send her the money for it. So, I cashapp her $55 for it. Whatever, at least it's cheaper than paying outright for food for the day. I have to hang with them until we get our first meal of the day, as my mom has the info for the passes to redeem them. After that I mention just seeing the animals on my own, as that is the only thing I actually enjoy. My mom guilt trips me once again. So, I basically spent the entire day watching my brother and sister ride roller coasters, and at one point my mom has me film my siblings on the rides for her. The ONLY ride I went on was the rapids, and I felt hurt that my mom bought my sister a stuffed animal that day but got onto me for wasting my money on a marbled dolphin statue. I even had to buy my first legal alcoholic drink (also my only that day). It honestly didn't really feel like my birthday. Later on, I brought up having to cashapp my mom for the meal pass and everything, and she told me it was because ""she was under the impression that I was going off by myself."" When I brought up her guilting me into staying with them, she said she did no such thing, I could have gone off and did whatever I wanted. She even told me I was in the wrong for complaining about it, as they actually changed the day they went to Busch Gardens so we would do something for my birthday.

My issue with Erica is that they purposely move all of their cars onto the street and will park them years at a time on the public curb. Since parking is public, I can't ask them to move their cars. Other neighbors have asked them to move their old rundown car that doesn't drive, and it took one of the neighbors calling a tow warning for them to finally move it.

i (20f) was friends with this girl (21f) online for a couple years. throughout our friendship she never liked the people i dated or was even friends with. she always had something bad to say about literally everyone. she was the type of person who needed your attention all the time and if you didn’t want to hang out it would end up being a problem and she’d make you feel guilty for it. i used to think i was a lesbian when i first met her, and i actually had a crush on her for about 2 months which she knew about. i later discovered i was instead bisexual and when i got into my first relationship with a guy she told me she didn’t want to be friends anymore because of that, and she refused to believe i was anything other than a lesbian, especially because she thought that was the only way i could be happy. that’s just a little context into our relationship. anyway, when i started dating my fiancé (22m) it was the biggest ordeal to her, she constantly judged me again for being bisexual, and when she found out he was trans, would deadname him or use the wrong pronouns. all i would ever hear from her throughout the time of us being friends was how he was manipulating me or gaslighting me or using me, or how he was a creep for dating me when i was still 19. none of this was true, she just didn’t like him. we stopped being friends because she got herself involved in a huge scandal involving a few of my fiancés friends that targeted me and my fiancé. they tried to out him and my friend participated in this. she had texted me multiple times after we stopped talking to say how much she missed me etc., but never once actually said she was sorry. i texted her a couple weeks ago in response to one of the old “i miss you” texts (in which was also a response to one of mine, which she accused me of not even writing myself, and said i had no autonomy, and how she felt like i was only friends with her because i had a crush on her) and i sort of went off on her, telling her how she never once genuinely apologized to me when another friend of mine who was also involved DID, and how i could never trust her again or want to speak to her again. i told her she had to stop treating herself like a victim when IMO she’s not at all in this situation.  it took a lot because i’m not one for confrontation, it makes me anxious, but i could not stand hearing her accuse me of having no sense of self and acting like she’s the only one who knows the “real me”. it always just felt like she wanted to make decisions for me, and she knew i was vulnerable so i would listen. i’m glad i’m out, but AITA for holding a grudge/going off on her?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4842367,public,top,self,AITA for telling my ex-friend off?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9bvcp/aita_for_telling_my_exfriend_off/,all_ads,6,,,

I downloaded it and signed in, and showed my not-gf my fallout shelter world

She noticed one character that had my ex’s name, she asked why I had it and I explained that we were playing it together and my ex named it after her, she got mad and asked if I could delete the character. Let’s explain that I could probably send her on a mission and let her die, but that would be a waste, because it’s a maxed out character and it takes a really long time to get those

So in front of her, I change the characters name to the name of my not-gf, but that wasn’t enough for her. She insisted I delete her, or even we could just delete the world and start a new world and I shot that down

One of my classmates in my major hardly goes to class. She’s probably only shown up 20-30 times the whole semester. Whenever I ask her where she was, she always responds with “i was anxious/depressed so i couldn’t go to class” 

Every single week, she asks me for my notes for the days she missed. I’m starting to get very sick of it. It’s not fair to me that I put in the time and effort of going to class, even on days where it feels impossible, while she doesn’t and she’ll still end up with the information covered if i give her my notes.

I work typically 48-60ish hours a week. Because tax bracket changes, I prefer 40-48 hours. Tonight, I had no employees due to short-staffed and worked a three person shift solo.  

Today was payday, and I was past needing groceries. We shopped all day, got home at 1240ish, I (F, 46) helped carry in Al the groceries, then jetted fast barely clocking in on time. Husband,(M, 46) mentioned going to order at a place I don’t care for, really never tasted it, but I figured since I didn’t have lunch, he’d text and see what I wanted for supper. 

At 630pm I realized he isn’t going to and I texted have you ordered. He said he’s, they were picking it up when I texted and told me what they paid. I let husband and son get home and eat their dinner while hot, and later
Texted if I have dinner.  He said he thought I would pick something up at the store (to cook, cause we don’t have a microwave), and I should have asked if I wanted dinner. 

Here’s the thing. For almost 7 years I work tons of hours supporting us. He’s the stay at home spouse due to this disability he literally just got approved for. He was injured working for the state, had nerve damage his right side is non functioning, but state drew it out.  Anyways, I think it is rude to buy everyone supper but me while I literally work a blue collar job to provide. I felt un cared for, unappreciated, and worse, forgotten. And I said all that. 

Husband apologized, offered half his meal which I said no thank you to, explained his logic: I don’t like it (not true, never ate it, and it was $68 for two people, so I usually decline because it’s expensive and I’m working so many hours to get by. But in fairness, I never expressed that to Husband) he figured I’d rather eat McDonalds or grab something from the grocery store. I find both those thoughts offensive, but didn’t say that. 

I reiterated this shows how little I matter, and he said I’m being extra because he offered his leftovers. He adores restaurant  leftovers, so for him that is always a don’t touch item, so I can see how to him that’s kind. But honestly, I want to be a thought. Not an afterthought, and I said that and more in text.  He said I’m “extra” and I know it isn’t like that.

They have been texting on and off ever since, and a few weeks ago my roommate asked me (20sF) if he could come and stay with us for 4 nights while he does “chef trials” (her words). She said he would be gone about 10 hours a day so it wouldn’t be a big deal. She also asked if he could have a key to our apartment so he could come and go as he pleased.

Now, that should have been a red flag right away. Unfortunately, my roommate asked me this while I was in the middle of a hugely important and busy week for me at school (I’m a law student). I was too tired to start drama, so I said whatever. 

Well, she asked if he could come a few days earlier, and I said fine. (She actually let him stay at our apartment alone over Thanksgiving, which was a whole other thing). That was a week ago and now it seems like he has no intention of ever leaving our apartment. The guy keeps saying he’s “looking for work” and will leave for a few hours, I guess to do that, but his main activity seems to be bumming around the house. 

This guy has no boundaries whatsoever. He touches all my stuff, and this morning I woke up to find used dental floss all over the bathroom floor. He leaves raw chicken all over the counter and violates house rules like no dishes in the sink. He never locks our front door so I keep waking up to find it’s been unlocked all night. Also, he coughs and sneezes everywhere. He’s managed to infect me, my roommate, and my roommate’s entire family with the flu. And did I mention I’m a law student trying to get through exams? 
Finally, he keeps making these vile-looking dishes and expecting me to eat them. He seriously gets so mad when I don’t want it. He also chops everything with this crusty-ass knife that he leaves laying out on the counter. Also, he looks like a creepier version of Paul Dano as the Riddler. 

A few hours ago, he showed up at our apartment while my roommate was still at work and I asked him if he had any big plans before he left tomorrow. He said he’s not leaving tomorrow. As I suspected, he hasn’t even bought a return ticket back to his country. He said he’s still waiting to hear back from jobs, which could take up to a week. I called my roommate and told her he needs to either get a hotel or book a plane ticket, because he can’t stay here anymore. She seemed to agree but she’s also kind of a pushover so I’m worried he’s going to convince her to let him stay. He left in a huff and now I’m waiting to hear back from either of them. I’m thinking maybe I shouldn’t have raised a fuss because it wasn’t worth it.

He’s in a psychiatric hospital and his mom is begging me to talk to him and be his friend, because he feels alone. Btw im ok with being friends, but he is a toxic person and only cares about himself. When i needed his help, he broke up with me, i actually was trying to broke up with him but i was scared. Btw im single since february.
My psychiatrist said he probably has bipolar disorder, borderline disorder and is narcissist. Friday 25 he got into the hospital, he was struggling with his mental health, couldnt handle college, couldnt handle his work in an hospital and couldnt even clean his house. So her mom texted me about what was going on, she sent some voice messages crying begging me to be his friend and to visit him in her house. He dont know that i know where he is.
I mean, i dont want to get involved because he can say that im trying to date him again, but im not trying. And i dont want to be sad because of someone that probably doesnt care about me. Honestly, i dont know what to do. I really like his mom, shes a good friend, probably ill try to be friends only because she wants it, but i know what will happen: maybe he is going to accuse me of trying to get back with him or maybe he will try to get back with me only because he is way too needy and wants someone to fill him with attention. I mean, he is so unstable that i dont even know what he is going to do in the next few hours.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4842319,public,top,self,AITA for not wanting to get involved in the life of my ex boyfriend who is in the psychiatric hospital now?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9bczv/aita_for_not_wanting_to_get_involved_in_the_life/,all_ads,6,,,
