I’m aware that I put too much attention on punctuality, it’s even a joke between my friends and I.

Please tell me if I should act differently. 

I started getting lash extensions about a month ago. The first appointment was so hard to make because they apparently only had the same time every day available, so I finally made time for that exact time and got my lashes. 
The second appointment was agreed on that first one, which was two weeks after. A day before the appointment I was asked to confirm, which I could answer to because I was working (I work directly with people, so I ignore my phone for a few hours every day). 
After I got my phone I had two messages. One, asking to confirm the appointment. The second, about three hours later, saying that they had given my appointment to someone else because I hadn’t confirmed. 
I told them the situation and they, somehow, gave me my appointment back. 

Finally, today I had my third appointment at 9 am. I got there 8:50 (because you have to be there 10 minutes earlier). At 9:05 I sent a message asking if there was a problem, since the place was closed. No answer, so at 9:10 I called and texted again, still no answer. 
9:15 I took a picture of myself at the place and told them that I wasn’t waiting anymore. 

9:30 they text me that “it’s open”, that the girl who was attending me had a problem with traffic but that she arrived only 15 minutes left. I told her that it wasn’t possible, since I left a few minutes after 9:15. Also told her that maybe they should have better communication, since I could’ve understood the traffic issue if I had known. 
She told me that the cell phone was left in the local, so I asked if both her and the woman that was going to attend me were late, and she said that SHE was late. I asked if it had been her the whole time and if she had been talking about herself in third person all the time, to which she answered that it was a spelling error. 
So that’s where we’re at. I don’t think I’m going to continue either the chat nor the appointments with their company.

She’s conservative and I’m not but that hasn’t ever really been a problem until now. A little while ago, Al asked me questions for us to answer and to share with each other.

At the end we talked and I asked if she would be ok with me possibly having a gf(I’ve always been confused with my sexuality)in the future. She said I’m a sister to her, but she can’t support it and would never want anything to do with my gf. Her saying that hurt and I started to overthink everything.

Al said she couldn’t see us not being friends in the future. I told her that I wasn’t sure if I could see us being friends in the future or not. I know that’s not an answer anyone wants to hear, but I had all of these emotions/thoughts running through my mind and felt like I had to give her an answer asap, I told her that I wanted to stay friends, and for a while, Al didn’t say anything else about the topic until about a week later.

She told me I put our friendship on a time limit, I would leave her suddenly, and that it was uncalled for. I tried to reassure her that I wasn’t doing that and I wouldn’t just leave her, and that I would try to work on problems with her.

I told her it was a future situation and I wasn’t sure how I’d feel unless it happens later on. Al said I was saying that I would stop being friends with her because of her beliefs and even though it’s a hypothetical problem, it was rude and it hurt her that I didn’t make a decision right away and I was making her feel bad about her beliefs.

I said 1 I still wanted to be friends, I wouldn’t drop her because of it and I’d try to work it out with her if it was a problem in the future, 2 I don’t have an issue with what she believes in and it wasn’t my intention to make her feel bad about it, and 3 I didn’t think that I was being rude with what I said, but I apologized to her since it wasn’t my intention to make her feel bad. She accepted my apology and said that she wouldn’t bring it up unless something happens.

Things were fine until Al said she felt like she needed to walk on eggshells and that I never acknowledged what I said hurt her. I did acknowledge her feelings last time, but I apologize for what I said again and tried to get her to see my POV as to why I said it. She didn’t understand why I was hurt by what she said, that my POV didn’t make sense and I made her feel disposable. For most of the argument, I was apologizing for saying it and for making her feel that way even though she never saw my POV. Al said that she wasn’t going to change her beliefs/who she is for anyone. I wasn’t asking her to do that at all, but she still thinks I was and thinks that we should take a break on our friendship. I don’t know what she wants me to do since it’s too late to take it back, I apologized and tried to get her to see where I’m coming from for more times than I can count.

How do I get through to him? AITA

We have a 2 month old, things have been Rocky with arguments probably due to exhaustion. The gap has always been noticeable to me but tonight it’s reached a new level.

He woke me up at 2:30 complaining “i just can’t do this anymore; twice” so I got up and went to take over the feed for the baby. I told him to go back to bed and he said “I’m up now” and continued to complain, so I asked him what he needed and what his solution was to the problem, instead of trying to find a solution he went on about how good I apparently have it, I get to sleep during the day, I get to sleep when the baby sleeps, he can’t concentrate at work, he doesn’t get to do all theee other things, back in the day the father used to provide and the mother would take care of the baby. I lost my cool at him  because all I was asking for was his resolution to the complaint and all he kept doing going on about how good I have it, to sleep when the baby sleeps (which I’ve tried but during the day he naps for 45 minutes and by the time I drift off he’s waking up) and diminishing what I do and how hard he has it. 

The reason I got so annoyed is because his main issue with me is that I ”complain too much” about being tired or not in the best mood, but this is exactly what he was just doing, having a whinge because he has to get up for one feed. 

For context, he does work from 11am-6pm, as a tattoo artist and business owner and he occasionally cooks dinner (1-2 times a week) I’m up with the baby from 2:30am and take care of him right until I go to sleep at 10:30pm so I get 4 hours of dedicated sleep time. The baby will usually wake once maybe twice during the 4 hours for him to feed. He has no other responsibilities at home other than his pet snakes. I take care of his dog and the entire household along with his other personal obligations and all the mental load. Before the baby I also worked full time (up until 2 days before I went into labour at 39 weeks 2 days).

Last night before the went to bed he said he didn’t do anything with the snakes because he cooked dinner (10 minutes, a quick streak) and helped me watch the baby, he was sat on the couch while I fed the baby and rocked him to sleep) in the 3 and a half hours he was home, the baby was asleep for 2 and a half. He requested that I tell him that he’s free to do what he needs so he knows he can feed the snakes and not “help”.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4837411,public,top,self,AITA for snapping at my boyfriend and wanting help taking care of the baby?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7xy7v/aita_for_snapping_at_my_boyfriend_and_wanting/,all_ads,6,,,,

We were having regular conversation when friend 2 brought up a new friend he made in university. This made friend 1 to tell us a story about how they bumped into said new friend and they got side eyed. Friend 1 said this has stuck with them for years and made them resent that person. Not knowing how to react I just laughed followed by friend 2 because of how absurd I found that a small accident had stuck with them for so long.

After that night, friend 1 was silent for multiple days (ignoring tagged messages in our group chat and tweets) until they sent a voice note saying that they found me and friend 2's reactions to be insensitive towards an event they found traumatic. I immediately apologized although friend 2 did not as he decided to not apologize just for the sake of it and thought he was justified. Following that, friend 1 decided to be silent again and not wanting to reply to any of our messages and removed us from their friend list in our favorite video game. Because of this I was quite hurt and was quick to react by removing them from all my social media and choosing to side with friend 2 on the matter.

Ever since that I've regretted my actions (after learning that person who side eyed friend 1 did more prior to this interaction) and have tried to rekindle my friendship with friend 1 by apologizing on not asking why they unfriended me in our video game in the first place and to want no tension between us. Their response was that they accepted my apology but saying everything would be ok between us only if they forgot about my existence (which I took as them wanting me dead). I said my goodbyes and regrets and have never spoken to them since.

After all of this, I have stopped being friends with friend 2 (because of them being the source of my bad decisions) and remained friends with other friends in earlier mentioned group chat (who are still friends with friend 1).

But our family are pretty broke so we’d never actually seen the real show even though we only live like 3 hours from NYC. 

I enter into the raffle on occasion where you can get good tickets for a low price. (It’s not like a free prize you still have to pay) And I actually won 2 tickets in October for one of the shows last week. 

In the past I told Molly if I someday won the tickets I’d take her but my boyfriend Lucas also really wanted to go. And when I won he told me if I took him he’d pay for gas, a nice meal out and a hotel which is a big help as otherwise it’s pretty tricky to get home the same night as the show ends late. And I wouldn’t be able to afford a hotel for me and Molly. So we turned it into a date 2 day trip away for us. 

So I didn’t tell Molly I won the tickets, I only told her after I went that Lucas had bought me tickets (a lie I know but I thought it was a white lie). She was a bit sad but fine. Then our mom told her that I got the tickets in the raffle and she freaked. Saying I know how much she wanted to go and im her sister and I should have her back over some guy etc etc. I said I always wanted to go too and he’s not just some guy he’s my bf of 1 year and he turned it into a proper trip away for us which we’ve never done before. And that the last time we spoke about the raffle was like a year ago when I barely knew Lucas and things have changed quite a bit with us since then. and I will still keep doing the raffle so she can go.

I (F45) have 2 siblings (M51, and F53), our families and our parents (M76 and F75) recently went on a cruise together. My husband and I have 2 kids, Leo and Mia (M15, F11). My brother and his wife have 2 kids, Ian and Aria (M13 and F11). My sister and her husband have 3 kids, Summer, Cadyn and Chase (F16, M14, M11). 

The cruise had many fun moments, but there was also quite a bit of fighting, the majority of which was caused by Chase. I love my nephew, I really do but it’s hard denying Chase has become a horrible person. Chase is a massive bully, his most recent incident getting trouble in school happened a few weeks ago, where him and a friend were caught saying racist slurs to other classmates. Chase is also in the 5th grade still because he was held back last year after failing due to lack of completing assignments. While I love my sister as well, the way she and her husband are parenting Chase is destructive. Whenever he does something bad, they “talk to him about why it was wrong” and don’t do anything else. I have never seen Chase show any form of remorse or regret for his actions.

The bad behavior for Chase started pretty quickly, at dinner on the first night of the cruise, he was extremely rude to our waiter, demanding the food come out faster and getting mad when others got their food first. After dinner, all the kids went to the arcade on the ship, when they came back, a few of the kids were saying Chase was being mean to other kids in the room. 

Chase and Cadyn have a rocky relationship, and the meanest thing Chase did was to Cadyn. Cadyn is a good kid, loves sports, especially baseball and lacrosse. Our family is all atheists, this is also true for Cadyn’s dad’s side of the family as well, but Cadyn has become religious in the past few years. Sports played a big role in him becoming religious/Christian, Cadyn is a good kid and never uses his religion to hurt others and doesn’t hate non-believers. Cadyn wears a necklace everyday that is like a cross necklace but incorporates baseball into the design, like a necklace made for Christian baseball fans.

Cadyn gets out of the shower and freaks out about not finding it until Summer sees Chase with the necklace and gives it to him. 

We celebrate Christmas every year by going to my parent’s house for breakfast, where they give them gifts, and then dinner at my house where we do secret Santa. When we got home, after seeing Chase’s behavior, I told him and his parents that until he wrote a letter apologizing about his behavior to staff, bullying in the arcade, and making his own separate note to Cayden, that he was not allowed at my house on Christmas. His parents said I was “overreacting” to Chase’s behavior, and my parents agreed with that notion. However, my husband thinks I’m not, and Cadyn has said he hasn’t forgiven Chase.

Daniel got engaged before BF and I got together, and the wedding is this upcoming Saturday at 4pm. We RSVP'd to the wedding back in early October.

My cousin (28F), we'll call her Emily, is about 5 months pregnant. We had a gender reveal planned for her in mid October, but it was cancelled due to the doctor not being able to detect the baby's gender. Two weeks ago, her mom threw together a baby shower for her that will be happening this upcoming Sunday at noon. I only heard about the shower less than a week ago from my mom.

Let me note that my mom has a tendency to not ask me about prior plans before assuming I can go to something - she expects me to always be available for whatever random family event/event she wants me to go to. She has done this before and I've had to cancel plans with friends due to her not letting it go, and I just decide the easiest route is to appease it.

Also worth noting is I have a very important final exam on the Monday following. I'm already making a sacrifice by going to the wedding.

The wedding is in a town about an hour and a half from my hometown, where the baby shower will be. We will be staying in a hotel there Saturday night with BF's family.

She recently started an argument, telling me there was little romance in our relationship, my business was taking up too much time, and she didn't get enough attention.

I started a business six months ago after a conversation with her, during which we discussed the time commitment required to get started.

Since then, she's been increasingly distant and moody, started ignoring her household duties, which we discussed, divvied up, and agreed upon, and has even started slacking off with our kids.

She's been feeling ignored due to the long hours I've been putting in on the business, our lack of dates in the last three months, and our lack of intimacy lately, which I concede are valid points.

In response, I suggested a bi-weekly or weekly date night for us, during which we could take turns planning, executing, and financing a fun evening together, but she blew a gasket when I said we should make it a regular thing.

She accused me of having to ""pencil her in"" to my schedule, complained of me ""not being spontaneous enough,"" and told me she wouldn't be ""relegated to a pre-arranged appointment"" when she's supposed to be the ""single most important person in my life.""

I think I may have missed the warning signs during our courtship, but my experiences are setting off warning bells all over the place now that this issue has taken center stage in our lives.

I take my oldest son to school, care for our younger son, and take them to their extracurricular activities (karate, friends' birthday parties, etc.). I also cook dinner for them, bathe them, and read to them nightly. These are not activities that happen occasionally. I do this every day, without fail, even on the days that she agreed to do these things.

Last night, when we discussed it again, she told me, ""the love feels like it's gone,"" and that, in no uncertain terms, she would not pick a day for us to go on a date and that it is entirely up to me to choose what day, plan it, and surprise her with it if I ""actually want to make this work.""

She works a regular schedule (same on/off days every two weeks), and I am still in a solo position with my business, so it would be much easier for me to make this happen (which I am perfectly willing to do) due to my more flexible schedule.

I feel like her refusal to make an effort in this matter, not to mention holding up her end of the bargain on our household duties and childcare (which are supposed to be split evenly), is a dealbreaker for me, but I'm concerned that I may be overreacting or not being sensitive to her needs.

I am exhausted and I just need to destress. As a treat, I bought a 2hr full body massage for myself and my gf, full whale music and everything. 

Massage was great apart from the fact that my gf's masseuse insisted in engaging in constant conversation with my gf. Masseuse spoke Chinese (but speaks English well enough to know what I'm saying), as does my gf (trilingual)

At first, I gave a look of annoyance to my gf, indicating I was looking for peace and quiet. 10m later, I said ""babe, the most relaxing bit of this is definitely you two chatting loudly"". Slightly passive aggressive, I admit, but I was clearly annoyed and was trying to avoid confrontation. Gf gave me a snarky reply but I thought the point was made.

Third time around, still loads of noise and I let out a loud sigh of annoyance. By this point, gf has stopped responding but masseuse still chatting away. Fourth time, I say ""babe, please"".

Quiet reigns for 10 or so minutes but then it reverts to normal. Fifth time rolls around and I've lost my patience. I snap and say to the masseuse ""if you two want to disturb something that just wants hibernate, can you please both fuck off to the zoo?"". 

This did not go well.

Everything went awkwardly quiet until the end of the massage but gf went apeshit after we left. Said I was rude, masseuse was just happy someone she massaged was Chinese, etc

My argument was that I booked this to relax and de-stress and it was ruined by this constant chatting (in Chinese, a language I don't speak) and I gave 5 clear signals that I wasn't happy. 

She was still mad when we got home. I may be the AH for overreacting but this was my reward for myself and I brought gf along who, in my opinion, contributed to it being ruined.

So my (22F) boyfriend (22M) and I have been together since this past May. He has a cousin, we'll call him Daniel (around the same age, not sure exact), and he is extremely close with Daniel. Daniel got engaged before BF and I got together, and the wedding is this upcoming Saturday at 4pm. We RSVP'd to the wedding back in early October.

My cousin (28F), we'll call her Emily, is about 5 months pregnant. We had a gender reveal planned for her in mid October, but it was cancelled due to the doctor not being able to detect the baby's gender. Two weeks ago, her mom threw together a baby shower for her that will be happening this upcoming Sunday at noon. I only heard about the shower less than a week ago from my mom.

Let me note that my mom has a tendency to not ask me about prior plans before assuming I can go to something - she expects me to always be available for whatever random family event/event she wants me to go to. She has done this before and I've had to cancel plans with friends due to her not letting it go, and I just decide the easiest route is to appease it.

Also worth noting is I have a very important final exam on the Monday following. I'm already making a sacrifice by going to the wedding.

The wedding is in a town about an hour and a half from my hometown, where the baby shower will be. We will be staying in a hotel there Saturday night with BF's family. Feasibly, I would most likely not make it home and be ready for the baby shower by noon. I also would like to dedicate most of my Sunday to preparing more for my exam.

My mom has informed me that me going to this wedding is me ""clearly choosing someone I don't know over my family."" The way I'm viewing it is that we RSVP'd a month before I even knew this baby shower was happening, so how would I be choosing it over the baby shower? You can't retract a wedding RSVP (or it would be rude at least) a week before just for a last minute baby shower.

But on the other hand, perhaps I should be choosing my cousin here. My mom is making me rethink if I'm TA because she is assuring me that my whole family will be upset with me over this. I really don't want them to think that. 

So do you guys this I'm TA?

Yesterday, i overheard one of them trying to talk to the teacher about someone who they wanted to kick out of the team. She was talking about me. This would affect my grade a lot because it is worth 40% grade of the semester for 2 different subjects.

My teammates on the project are considering excluding me from our rating on the project, and it seems unfair to me. (They didn't even notify me or try to discuss it, I ended up finding out) During the laboratory practices, I was the one who cooperated the most and made sure that everything was in order. Then last Thursday we all got together in the afternoon to work on the project for two hours. During the weekend I was doing a part of the project that was my turn and when I let them know, they told me that another of us had already done that part of the project when clearly we had agreed that I was going to do it. It seemed unfair to me because I was spending time and effort on it so that later they would not take it into account and blame me for not working. Subsequently, they assigned me another part of the project and I honestly hadn't understood what I had to do in that case, so I told them that I didn't really understand that part and it seemed very confusing. I talked to my colleagues and they told me that I was fine and I continued working with the rest that was missing.

After we turned it in, in the afternoon while i was still at school and overheard the conversation of my ""friend"" and the teacher.

She started saying i didnt do nothing for the team and stated thati didnt pay enough attention in class, which isnt true and barely had anything to do.

I had to send an email to the teachers explaining my situation so i wouldnt fail their classes because of my ""Friends"".

He was back in the states while the rest of us were working in Papua New Guinea for the past 6 months.

He basically has no social media presence, and nobody searches China for 1 person (out of 1.4 billion.)

But I digress. 

That leaves me with my mom (44), who in my opinion is a disgrace of a person. Cheater, loved neglecting me, liked bullying, treated me like her fucking butler, said gays should be executed(!), and at one point tried starving me at 12 because I calles my sister a satsuma (due to her awful makeup) and a fuckwit (she is!) She loved ghosting me and telling her friends a load of BS, such as: I banged a classmate, I'm gay, and I wanted to use a knife on my sister (looking back, doesn't seem bad).

So my childhood was dogshit, to put it lightly. My saving grace were my friends and my aunt, both legends. I was able to get a weekend job at 15 in a bakery, since by Canadian law, it's legal as long as your parents consent (my mom did). The bakery was nice and a refreshing change from my authoritarian home. As well as that, I found any excuse I could to spend as little time as possible at home (my mom tried to end that, but failed), up til 18, when I left for college, as an A and B student. Best. Time. Ever. 

Fast forward to now. My sister found a bf at 23 and they immediately hit it off. (Not surprising - he's also a crap person). Within just a few months they were already fucking each other trying to make a baby. It worked and she's 35 weeks pregnant (I only learnt a month ago - someone told me randomly, not that I wanted it).

Then here's where this starts.
My mom called me, asking me ""nicely"" to come. I said fuck no. Since when do I have interest in going? For a while my mom cursed me out begging me to come. The answer - no, no, no, fucking no! 

I mean, who wants to go see a Karen before giving birth to a person who's probably gonna be a shit ass Karen as well.
My mom chewed me out for apparently being disconnected (wonder why!) and said I would be cut out of I don't come.
I didn't, and I really don't care. But apparently my sister caused a huge scene since I wasn't there according to some family, and said without my ""power"", her baby would be cursed. It already is since she's the mother.
Loads of my relatives and my mom and sisters friend have called me furious, saying I owe my life to my sister for missing such an important part of her life (I don't owe her $2 ass shit.)

My dad needed a place to stay for a few months, and I gave him my spare room.

I rarely use AC, and I normally let it get to 85 inside before I turn it on. I keep it at 55 in the winter as well. I'm happy with an electric blanket and double socks.

My dad has always insisted on arctic temperatures. I grew up with the thermostat at 65. I set the stat to 78 when he stayed with us but he had serious issues with this.

Every single day I'd leave for work I'd come back and it would be 65. I had an ancient HVAC system which was inefficient, and my electricity bill the first month he was there was a whopping $430. It was normally ~85.

Long story short I forced him to pay the difference. He told me I was an asshole because I benefited from the AC as well. Gave me a spiel about how it's cheaper to keep the house at 65 all the time than it is to turn it on sometimes to keep it at 78. He's an industrial HVAC engineer and while his case sounded like total BS, I had no idea how to argue against him, so I told him to wait for the bill.

I didn't charge him for rent, food, etc but the electric bill stretched my budget, and I was wildly uncomfortable at 65.

I obviously feel I am not the asshole here, but it's been brought up exhaustively by him and my family for years now. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit for treating my father that way.

I have 3 kiddos. 9f 5f and 1m. My oldest are in school. But my 5yo only goes 4 days a week. 

My BIL and SIL have two littles (2m&amp;1f) and both work. They work strange and long hours. Both of their children are in daycare. They pay upwards of 2k a month for their kids. My SIL works a government job that even though she is “full time” she never makes 40 hours a week and works 6/7 days a week. My BIL owns his own business and is constantly working. 

Over the summer while on holiday, my sil mentioned that she wants to look for alternatives to daycare to bring down costs. She asked if I was willing. I told her I would have to think on it. I love my niece and nephew to pieces. But I’ve been looking forward to 1 on 1 time with my son for some time now. 

A few weeks after, they both again complained about money to my husband. How they were spending too much money on childcare and not making enough to live the lifestyle they want. My husband brought up my watching the kids to me again. And I said I really wasn’t interested in doing it full time. He said “cool. It’s all up to you.”

Then. Out of the blue. They buy themselves this EXPENSIVE suv. It’s used and I’m well aware of used vehicle prices at the moment. But I also know that you can buy similar or older but not THAT much older for much less than what they spent. 

Then they continued to pester me about money and daycare expenses. I just told them I’m backup if I’m available. That’s it. I’m not interested in waking up at 5 am and watching kids from 5 to 5 daily. 

I never mentioned my annoyance over their spending so much on a car. It’s not my place to voice my opinion. But I did let it solidify that I will not “help bring child care costs down”. If they can afford to make stupid choices like a $900 a month car payment. Then can swing their child care bill.

In June my then girlfriend Kim started getting really close to her coworker John, and I did not think much of it. They became best friends soon after and personally she had maybe 2 or 3 friends so I was mostly glad she found someone she could call friend. We had been dating a little over a year and she is a very beautiful person and can be very outgoing after getting to know her. 

Problems arose when they began to hang out more frequently, and mind you this relationship is long distance if you could call it that. I worked about 2 hours away and had to relocate to accommodate for that. I would only see her on weekends, which would be the days she worked. so I'd spend my time at her place before, during, and after work (her work). One day, out of the blue she said that she had begun second guessing our relationship which was odd as she never once showed ""symptoms?"" idk of being displeased. I asked if John had anything to do with anything and she said no. But on one of the weekends I see a notification from John asking her if she wanted to go to a wedding with him and I was kind of surprised to see it. I didn't think much of it and she ended up not going because it happened to be on a weekend and I was there with her.

Things got better for us and as I ask how she felt now, she says she still doesn't know. I begin to overthink and I spontaneously opened her phone while she slept and saw messages between her and him that were extremely flirty. She would compliment his physique and talked about how she didn't know if she wanted to be with me anymore. Which was hurtful as she did not even mention some of these things to me, even though I am a big communicator even going as far as asking her about her feelings for john or if she wanted me, which is something extremely uncomfortable to do. I look at her  notes, because I know she loves to write about how she is feeling and such. I knew this was completely wrong and knew that if I did or didn't find anything it would ruin our relationship completely but I just had to know. long story short, she wrote about how she cheated on me after she and him got drunk after work. what hurt me most was that she lied to me whenever i asked about how she was feeling. When i confronted her she said that she didnt want to hurt me and that she was hoping she would eventually lose feelings for john because she still loved me.

With these pains, she began to feel extremely irritable, starting to attack me and my mother.

  I was recently diagnosed with autism (Asperger's Syndrome) and I have sensitivity to loud noises and it has gotten much worse since I was diagnosed. She started to attack me more and more, humiliating me and yelling at me. Today I did the housework while she got my antidepressant and my insomnia medication. When she arrived, she started complaining about the cats and having to get my medicine, because the attendant took a long time and cursed and shouted at me and said that I was acting retarded and deaf (just for using the headphones a lot) and she even said that I didn't do anything at home (she came home while I was cleaning the floor to help her). She treated me so badly that I was crying in my room and I came here for my mother's work to get away from her. She started screaming in my ear on purpose to create ""resistance"" to the loud sounds.

  I understand that this is because of the stress of the cats and her constant pain, but still, when I do everything she asks, nothing is looking good for her. So much so that I'm looking for a job to get out of the house as soon as possible. My friends say that it's normal and that I shouldn't be angry. I was so angry that I said I wanted her dead and I was lectured for it.

My mom told me what I got should be split equally between us all. I said it shouldn't because my aunt wanted stuff left to me.

So my (22F) boyfriend (22M) and I have been together since this past May. He has a cousin, we'll call him Daniel (around the same age, not sure exact), and he is extremely close with Daniel. Daniel got engaged before BF and I got together, and the wedding is this upcoming Saturday at 4pm. We RSVP'd to the wedding back in early October.

My cousin (28F), we'll call her Emily, is about 5 months pregnant. We had a gender reveal planned for her in mid October, but it was cancelled due to the doctor not being able to detect the baby's gender. Two weeks ago, her mom threw together a baby shower for her that will be happening this upcoming Sunday at noon. I only heard about the shower less than a week ago from my mom. 

Let me note that my mom has a tendency to not ask me about prior plans before assuming I can go to something - she expects me to always be available for whatever random family event/event she wants me to go to. She has done this before and I've had to cancel plans with friends due to her not letting it go, and I just decide the easiest route is to appease it. 

Also worth noting is I have a very important final exam on the Monday following. I'm already making a sacrifice by going to the wedding.

The wedding is in a town about an hour and a half from my hometown, where the baby shower will be.  We will be staying in a hotel there Saturday night with BF's family. Feasibly, I would most likely not make it home and be ready for the baby shower by noon. I also would like to dedicate most of my Sunday to preparing more for my exam. 

My mom has informed me that me going to this wedding is me ""clearly choosing someone I don't know over my family."" The way I'm viewing it is that we RSVP'd a month before I even knew this baby shower was happening, so how would I be choosing it over the baby shower? You can't retract a wedding RSVP (or it would be rude at least) a week before just for a last minute baby shower. 

So do you guys this I'm TA?

The owner (45+F) is fucking awful and treats everyone like shit while overworking the hell out of them (I was pushing 70 hour weeks at one point). She fired the district manager/trainer and absorbed his position while ignoring all of the responsibilities that came with it. She fully neglects the stores in our district unless we have a food safety audit coming up, which is only because those results directly affect her. As a result, I was dumped in a location and expected to know how to do EVERYTHING for the store with zero training from day 1.

I will admit I have made some mistakes. All things that could have been avoided had I actually been shown how to do my job or set up for success rather than failure! I have been being singled out for months in a group chat with all the managers in it. I get humiliated in the managers chat for making simple mistakes. she would even get mad at me and humiliate me in the group chat for things I didn’t do, like forgetting to order an item.But when I would advocate for myself and remind her that I haven’t been shown how to do any of these things she would say “well you could have just asked for help”. She has been picking with me for months, while cutting all the other managers a lot of slack, so I quit yesterday. 

Before quitting I went into the system and gave all of my crew members a $1 raise, I feel like they put up with so much bullshit on a daily basis due to us also being short staffed and they receive no recognition, no gratitude and receive subpar wages via PAPER CHECK. There was a lot of funny business going on in upper management especially by the owner herself, so I took it upon myself to send my team a farewell, I apologized for not being able to provide them the work environment they deserved, I was simply set up to fail from the start. I also decided to blow the top off of all of these secrets within GM’s at other stores. The owner made it a point to ensure I NEVER spoke of my salary to the other managers. I was making $50,000, they were all making $38,000-$40,000. Their stores make more money than mine, they deserve more simply for all the shit they deal with. She can afford it. She would just rather be cheap. I sent a message calling the owner out on her bullshit in front of everyone, the same way she has always done to me, I told them my salary and how it was intentionally kept a secret, and I told the managers to demand the same pay I was receiving and then I left the chats and turned in my keys.

The owner is now accusing me of sabotaging the store and “erasing the database” which isn’t true, i would never do that and i don’t even know how to do that, I actually went into the system and did all the necessary paperwork so that my team would be set for the rest of the week.

I’m a cashier at Petsmart. I had a 9 to 5 shift this past Saturday and towards the end of it I started feeling very drained and tired. So I got a bit irritable but masked it.

Until I came upon this customer, that is.

So I’m ringing out customers. My next one comes up and of course it’s a cranky old man. 

I start ringing his multiple cans of cat food (all different flavors, poorly organized ofc) and he complains I’m going to slow. I respond in my nicest customer service voice that I’m sorry, I have to scan each different one for inventory reasons.

That pissed him off. He scoffed and said that was ridiculous and that I’m annoying him by being so fake nice. That I was annoying and incompetent and etc. 

I was not amused. I’ve been nothing but kind to this guy and he insults me? Wtf?!

So I looked the old fucker dead in the eye with a fake smile and said very deadpan: “You know, sir, you’re not being very nice right now. I’m just doing my job and you’re seemingly looking for every reason under the sun to argue     with me. Please don’t berate me, I’m almost done now.”

He glared but said nothing the rest of the transaction. He never complained or anything as far as I know. 

I told a manager what happened just in case he decides to. I was told I was in the wrong. I don’t see how. I’m not being paid to be verbally abused by nasty old men. I was told I was unprofessional.

I 31f am bisexual and currently in an amazing relationship with a woman. But 4 years ago I was dating Dave. Thing’s lasted only a few months but we stayed great friends. Over the weekend we had dinner party with Dave, his girlfriend and a few other people 
Not sure how, but the conversation switched to how I started dating women after Dave and I split. And how his gf after me (not his current gf) also started dating women. Dave said “Well at least I gave you amazing orgasms! I’m great at my job”I said “Actually I faked all of them. The sex was terrible every single time” He laughed at first then said “wait you can’t be serious” I said “You last less than 10 minutes, I always had to be on top, and you didn’t like giving oral sex. I liked you because you were funny, smart, and kind. Things were great, besides the sex” Everyone was laughing and he turned to his gf and said “well at least you like it baby” she kinda blushed and said “well I mean I wish you would do more, I takes me a long time to orgasm. But I do love you” 
Dave got upset and stormed off. His girlfriend apologized to us and left after him.
The dinner party got quiet and some people were telling me that I should’ve just lied to spare his feelings 
Dave hasn’t responded to my messages, yet his girlfriend told me that she was glad it was brought up so that they could talk about it.

I’ve known him since childhood so I know what he’s like. We live in different countries, and he stayed with my family for a while to attend university. He was never at his desk. I only saw him study occasionally in the years he stayed with us. His parents fully paid for the fees and sent him allowance so he didn’t have to work and could focus on his studies, but he did. He worked part time and with the money he got from it he spent it on renting areas to have football matches(????). He constantly failed his exams and I remember him dropping out of his course and going back with his family. Three years later, he announces that he’s getting married. Which is good and we sincerely congratulated him. He mentioned that he was coming back to the country we were in, and that he would stay with his wife. We were surprised and asked them for the reason and his wife said that he had a job there and it shouldn’t be a surprise. Now this is where we get really confused. But he just shook his head and told us he would call us later. He calls us in the evening, and that’s when we find out that he told her he had a job and a house in our country, and that they were set and for her not to worry about anything. Houses are quite expensive so only those who’ve been here for a while or have a high income can afford one, and as for jobs, he’s dropped out of the course and didn’t even study in the country, there’s no way he could have found one. He asked for my parent’s help, to buy him a house, and that he would pay us back later(he doesn’t want to tell his wife or family that he lied). Under normal circumstances we would have gladly offered to loan him money, but the fact that his family and wife were unaware of any of it was really disappointing. My dad harshly refused and we thought that was it and that he told his parents about it.

Later on when we had a family call(2 days before they were flying over to our country), I (only me and his family since my parents were at work) happened to ask his parents about how they were going to handle Ryan’s house and job issues.

I dated my ex for 3 years until we found out I couldn’t have kids. He wanted kids so that was the end of our relationship. I met my husband a year after the breakup and we married a year after that. 
Immediately after the breakup, my ex moved to another state and we went no contract. After I got married, I move to a different state with my husband. About a year later, my parents moved to a completely different state. None of us are living in the original state nor are we living in the same state with each other now.

While my ex and I were together, he became very close to my parents. My dad treated him like a son and they used to go fishing together. Our breakup was as hard on them as it was on me. 

Fast forward to now. We went to my parents for thanksgiving and while preparing dinner, I noticed a beautiful chef knife in her pantry. It seemed out of place sitting with her other knives so I picked it up. It felt different and was sharper than any knife I’ve ever held. It just screamed expensive. I asked my mom where she got it and she was suddenly nervous. After going back and forth without answering, I finally pinned her down and she told me my ex gave it to her as a birthday gift. Confused, I asked more questions and it turns out my ex have been visiting my parents once or twice a year since we broke up and they text about as much. She assured me they never talk about me and it’s like friends visiting. I didn’t notice but my husband was standing in the living room and heard everything.

Later the night, he angrily told me to tell my ex to stop coming around. I pointed out that my ex is not “coming around”, he’s visiting my parents who lives in a different state from us and that we haven’t talked since the day we broke up. We whispered argued until I had enough and told him if it bothers him that much, he can tell my dad to stop seeing my ex but I refuse to contact my ex on such a minor issue. My husband is intimidated by dad so he won’t say anything and is still stewing days later.

I have 3 kiddos. 9f 5f and 1m. My oldest are in school. But my 5yo only goes 4 days a week. 

My BIL and SIL have two littles (2m&amp;1f) and both work. They work strange and long hours. Both of their children are in daycare. They pay upwards of 2k a month for their kids. My SIL works a government job that even though she is “full time” she never makes 40 hours a week and works 6/7 days a week. My BIL owns his own business and is constantly working. 

Over the summer while on holiday, my sil mentioned that she wants to look for alternatives to daycare to bring down costs. She asked if I was willing. I told her I would have to think on it. I love my niece and nephew to pieces. But I’ve been looking forward to 1 on 1 time with my son for some time now. 

A few weeks after, they both again complained about money to my husband. How they were spending too much money on childcare and not making enough to live the lifestyle they want. My husband brought up my watching the kids to me again. And I said I really wasn’t interested in doing it full time. He said “cool. It’s all up to you.”

Then. Out of the blue. They buy themselves this EXPENSIVE suv. It’s used and I’m well aware of used vehicle prices at the moment. But I also know that you can buy similar or older but not THAT much older for much less than what they spent. 

Then they continued to pester me about money and daycare expenses. I just told them I’m backup if I’m available. That’s it. I’m not interested in waking up at 5 am and watching kids from 5 to 5 daily. 

I never mentioned my annoyance over their spending so much on a car. It’s not my place to voice my opinion. But I did let it solidify that I will not “help bring child care costs down”. If they can afford to make stupid choices like a $900 a month car payment. Then can swing their child care bill. 

Although I won’t change my mind about watching the kids, I do wonder now that I’ve seen their adjustments to their life (no more warehouse memberships, buying generic ((which I do not frown upon.

When he'd visit or we'd go by him and his mom (different states) him and I would play video games, or football,  do stuff as a group,  etc. 

Jeremy had kids and got married a few years ago.  His mom moved back here a few years ago.  So Jeremy and his family visit once or twice a year.  

I go to school and work, part time.

 Jeremy (and his mom when she'd visit) thinks everyone's life stops when he visits. He won't give much notice either.

Summer of 2021 it worked out that I was off while he was in town. He invited me to go to the zoo with him, his wife and his kids. I'm not really a kid person but he kept nagging me so I went.  

His daughter  Jenny is a good little girl.  She's smart and polite and a fun kid. His son Jimmy is a different story.

Jimmy is argumentative and rude.

I had a knee brace on because I have patella femoral syndrom, our zoo is huge and I didn't want my knee to get sore.  Jenny asked about it and I said it's to help my knee. 

Jimmy decided to keep walking in front of me or stopping short,  then asking if it hurt my knee. It didn't but it was annoying.  Jeremy told him to knock it off, Jimmy kept doing it and claiming he forgot.  

Jimmy is argumentative.  He kept trying to debate me about stuff with different animals.  I didn't care enough and I'm not arguing with a kid so I just said ""ok sure"" and moved on.  So he kept insisting that meant he was right and smarter than me.  

He kept wanting snacks,  I swear every snack stand we passed he wanted something,  his parents said no. Then he started asking me.  I said no. So he asked why not and said I have a job so I should buy it for him. 

Anyway I don't want to be around Jimmy, unless it's a bigger group. 

I ended up telling my aunt about how he acted. She said ""he's a kid"" and blah blah blah.  Then she told my mom that Jimmy gets bullied at school and Jeremy doesn't understand why. 

I guess now they think he has asperger's.  My aunt told my mom and I earlier this year.  She acted like his behavior is ok because of that though.  I still don't want to be around him .

Anyway Jeremy was here for Thanksgiving. He text me in October and said we should meet up and to let him know when I'm off. I had no intention of doing that.
 
Between work and school my first day off was Thanksgiving, my mom and I did our own thing.  I was also off black Friday.  I met up with some friends and did lunch and drinks Friday. I never told Jeremy when I was off. A friend of mine posted a selfie of us Friday.  

Jeremy went home Monday.  Apparently he seen the post and said something to his mom about how ""getting drunk with my friends was more important than seeing family,  and he used to do stuff with me so I should return the favor with his kids"". 

My mom said I should have just hung out with them for a little while at least and Jimmy is a kid I should let it go.

I told her that night he needs to keep the phone at her house and she blew up at me.

Now some more background, my ex is constantly seeking attention and validation. When we first separated, she would be texting them and snapping them throughout the day. I had to limit that in our divorce that she is allowed to contact them in the morning and at night before bed. They can contact her at any time. My kids are 8 to 14. My oldest has a phone and has since she was 12 (which I was against). My other kids have tablets and old phones off-network they can use to contact her if they want, and I limit their electronics time through a filter on my router. I believe this was specifically to bypass the ""electronics off at 8pm"" filter I have set on the wifi so she can contact them throughout the night.

I just found out this morning she also gave my youngest the old phone and set her up on Snapchat so she can text her as well. One comment in our argument gets to me. She said ""what we talk about is between us"" when I said they can also use my phone to say goodnight. I've never monitored what they talk about on Snapchat.

Since then her dad had of course fallen in love with the girl. She was old, deaf, and blind but honestly she had never been happier. Unfortunately also in those years, two of the three kids at the house moved out and their parents divorced so it’s just her dad and brother at home with the dog. Her dad would talk to this dog like she was a person, and said she made things less lonely. Until late last night/ this morning when he woke up to her having little seizures and just in a lot of pain. He screamed for the brother to come help and they took her to the vet to be put down. Now here is where the issue is, I spent all morning holding K letting her get it all out and trying to be there for her while she got ready for work, as she was leaving I told her I would come in at 1 instead of 5 like she originally asked for before her dog died, and she tried asking me to skip the whole class or just end portion because it’s not a necessity, but my classes are graded on attendance as well as participation and other things, I tried saying nicely that I wouldn’t be able to or that I had wished there was more time to figure it out but she got mad and said “sorry she didn’t die sooner” we had a little angry conversation that I don’t remember what the context was and then I kissed her goodbye.

Things ranging from taking some documents for his company to be posted to driving someone somewhere. This has happened multiple times and its always an inconvenience because 9 times out of 10 I have to be somewhere else at that time so I usually have to cancel any plans I had at the last minute.

A few days ago I came home from work and he asked me am I working tomorrow (and he knew that I did in fact had to go to work). After I confirmed it he told me that he had arranged for one of his business partners to come by office so that I can give him some documents (me and my father do not work together). I sad okay and ask him when will the guy come, and he told me that he gave him my number and that he will call during the day when he has time to come to pick up the documents.

The thing is I often have to visit other locations in the city so it is very possible that I won't be in my office when that guy calls, so I told him that he can't keep making promises and arrangements that include me without checking with me first and that I will try and help him but that this will be the last time.

My father then went on a tirade how I am ungrateful, that he always helps me when I ask and my personal favourite: ""Why should I check anything with you, who do you think you are?"".  
I told him that he keeps misunderstanding the situation, its not that I don't want to help him, but that its extremely rude and stupid to make plans that include me without checking with me first.  
He than told me to get F'd and to never ask him for anything again. I told him that he should know better, and that its a disgrace for a man as old as he is to be acting like a spoiled child (this is where I might be the asshole). We have not been speaking since.

I later called my mother who told me that she was with him when he was on the phone with his business partner, and that she had asked him whether he checked with be about this and he lied to her and told her that he did.  
I know that this sounds extremely stupid, but this is just the tip of the iceberg of all the shit he pulls every single day, my uncle says that I'm an asshole for talking to him like I did but I was completely calm until he started raging.

Bf (25M), Me (22F)

My bf has these friends who are 20 years older than him, (a couple who are in their 40s and have a kid, and a newly broken up couple in their mid 30s). He's known them for a few years and they live in the same area. When he didn't have much money for food, he'd come around to their place and they'd joke about how he has no shame in doing it and would jokingly call him derogatory terms like a food beggar (but in a bad way)

He considers them family, and it's bc of them that we met. I was around 19-20 when he was and they'd push us to be together, and would tease him to buy me a cup of coffee or that he's too poor to spend money on me, knowing he's got no money. I felt bad and would tell him it's okay. I was close with them but things changed.


Basically, I don't like 100% how they joke. They'd tease me that they saw my bf with some other girl, like ""oh weren't you with ____ last night?"" And they'd laugh, and my bf would laugh and say not to joke, or he'd get in trouble with me later. I just chuckle and let it pass, but it's always like this. They'll even say a girl's name and say at least she pitches more money than I do.

They'll watch thirst traps, scandals and show them to my bf, joke about how good this girl would taste or her sitting on my bf's face, or ""well you've always wanted to know what a girl from this city taste like right?""

Would comment under his posts about ""oh, your GF was ____ this time right?"" ""Your other GF might get mad!"" ""He's hiding her on his  phone!""

Some jokes I'll laugh. It makes me sad for him, bc they bully and joke with him a lot about not pitching in, and he ends up borrowing from me. He tolerates it, tells me off if I say anything different. I remind him that he can appreciate them, but doesn't mean he has to tolerate everything.

He looks up to them, and both of the guys have cheated. And tolerates it, since ""they're my friend"".
 
Pissed me off that one call and he's immediately there. Refuses to say no to them, even if it means leaving his grandma at home alone the entire night, and is too hungover to take her places. Or I have to stay back to keep her company. 

They're always on about how they could get along with his exes with these jokes. I'm the only gf who's better, and he/they will tell me I'm just not mature enough if I have a problem with their jokes.

I understand that a mother is always a mother and I should respect her wishes and her rules. But she puts to much pressure on me and bosses me around too much.

Yesterday we were returning from Netherlands to Germany after visiting my sister, and she wanted me to tank the car before we got on the highway. We still had more than half (Wich was enough to reach home) and I said that if we really had to tank than I would prefer to do it at back at Germany. I explained  that I hated to do it at Netherlands because I didn't understand their benzin system. My mom would have none of it and started to pressure me into tanking. After we got to the tank station I (as always) didn't understand the names. I asked at the counter but the girl didn't know it too. I returned to the car and said I didn't want to tank there because I thought the benzin they had was not the one we need. My mom started to get really mad and shouted for me to look it up online and if I couldn't do it then she would. After looking it up I still was insure but I knew that if I retured inside I would be yelled at again. After four bad nights at my sisters place because of the kids and having a four hour journey ahead of me, I didn't want to be yelled at more than I already was. So I tanked anyway. Today my car started to make noises. Turned out to be the wrong kind of benzin. My mom started yelling ar me how irresponsible I was and how I only did out of spite  in order to ""teach her a lesson"".

I desperately need opinions because I am in a huge quandary. 

I (22) have been with my boyfriend (23) for about 9 months. He has been in a relatively large friend group since the beginning of our relationship. His ex-girlfriend (fictional name: Emily) is also a part of it, which is totally fine with me. I actually get along with her pretty well too and we often see each other. They were together for a long time before our relationship (about 4 years) and they both have been a part of the group since the beginning, so I didn't feel like I was in a position to complain about it. Before we got together, the two of them had not been separated for too long. 

So much for the general situation....

A good friend (fN: Annelise) of one of the people in the group (I'll just call him Samuel), who is pretty much my boyfriend's best friend, has now told me something that could split the entire group. I know I can trust what Annelise is saying, because Samuel told her about it, so I am very sure it is true.

So Samuel apparently slept with Emily (at least once).... I don't know if I need to say more, because I think most people agree: you don't sleep with your friend's ex, especially if it's your best friend. PLUS they broke up not even a year ago, so ist not like a few years passed. The thing that bothers me the most about it is the fact that Samuel is pretending to be a good friend in front of my boyfriend. 

The knowledge of this weighs so heavily on me. 

Normally, of course, I would tell my boyfriend without hesitation! He deserves to know and I feel so  bad leaving him in the dark. 

I know he wouldn't mind if she had a new boyfriend in gernerall. He is over her and was long before he broke up (otherwise I wouldn't be with him of course). But her f# his best friend would definitely destroy him and especially his trust in Samuel (which Samuel absolutely does not deserve...).

What makes me hesitate to address it is the fact that a similar situation has already happened in the group and that has separated them completely. Also, as a ""new member"" of the group, I don't want to be responsible for a huge fight. The next thing is that even if me and my boyfriend would try to avoid Samuel, its really not possible for the both of us. 

I just don't know what to do. Of course, my boyfriend is above everything to me and I really really don't want to lie to him or keep a secret.

On the other hand, I don't want to be the reason why the group gets destroyed....

I (14) and my mom (42F) were supposed to go to the laboratory today to get some stuff done, the issue is that my mom goes into work at 6 am, the lab didn't open till 7:30.

When we get out she tells me ""youre taking an uber to school""
Going on ubers makes me extremely anxious, specially by myself, i tell her that i can't do it.
She tells me she can't drop me off, i say ""that's fine, i can go on the bus""
She refuses since it will make me go late.

I checked my gps before, it was 32 minutes,
I was going in time!

I love my wife.
We are appropriately sexually active for 20 something's.
This is a burner account.

My wife is completely unaware of any of what I'm about to explain. There is no conflict with her because she doesn't know, it is really a internal conflict with my conscious I guess...

 Like 1 a month average I guess, we live together and live is hectic 🤷‍♂️

The nudes she sends are great frontal kinds of pics. I have been hinting that someday it might be fun and surprising to get one from behind.  

She did send me a 'standard-fair' pic pretty recently, and really it was a great pick-me-up. I returned the favor, very flirty sexty kind of day. I really do not mean to sound ungrateful, because I am extremely appreciative of anything she gives!

The other day I was left alone while she ran an errand. She forgot her phone. Pure curiosity took over. I happened to poke though her pics. Her 'deleted' folder only clears after 30 days if she doesn't manually delete them.

Inside her 'deleted' I found 3 interpretations of the pictures I have basically been craving. Each better than the last. Definitely showing her best.... Angle... I guess she took them along with what she did send, but she decided not to share them.

I quickly copied them and my wife has no idea.

Is this morally reprehensible?

On one hand, she didn't 'will' me to see them. I did have to be sneaky I guess.

On the other hand, she snapped the pic to potentially share with me... And it isn't anything I haven't seen IRL... And we are married.

More than 2 years ago, Rachel became pregnant and the trips increased, so she asked me to take care of Cookie, Rick's dog always with the agreement that she would take care of her expenses. I had 2 bigger dogs by my own so I agreed, since it wasn't a lot of work to add another smaller one to tasks.

Cookie came very sick, a serious eyes infection and very over weight, and needed special care. Months go by, however her eyes did not improve. I pointed out that Cookie was getting sicker and needed a specialist and got into an argument with my sister for not getting help for her so she took Cookie somewhere else.

A couple of months later, Rachel gave birth, and she again asked me to take care of Cookie, because she couldn't handle both of them and Rick was always out of town. However, this time the Cookie came in in worse conditions, her eyes were much bigger and sicker.

It's been almost 2 years since my nephew was born and we kept taking care of Cookie since that. I took her as my own, assumed all the costs of Cookie 1 year ago, took her to a specialist. She has lost weight, we started to feed her a natural diet, we operated on her tumors, in short, she is like another dog and we assumed that Cookie was left for us to keep and take care of and we love her as part of our family.

2  months ago, Rachel and Rick told me they want Cookie back, my nephew seems to love her when he come to my house. However they never asked about Cookie for this last year, we told them about her expenses, about treatments and how happy we are that she's doing so great and they didn't pay us but we didn't insist on it (main reason why we assumed Cookie was ours now)

I have tried to explain to my sister that I think Cookie is better with us, and why is our right to keep her. However she is siding with Rick and his family, she insists that Cookie is his and we are stealing her.  She told me Cookie wasnt Rick's to begin with, that she belongs to Rick's father and he is pointing out that maybe If we want to keep her we need to pay for her but this isn't an option for me neither, you know cause I wasn't looking for having a third sick dog to take care of until they drop her here. So I gave her to options:

1. Pay me all the expenses, vet, medications, nursing for 2 years, then I pay for Cookie to be mine.

2. Sue me for stealing the dog to get Cookie back.

This went on regularly for the past 4 months. Well, 2 weeks ago I turned in my vacation request form and my boss came in my office and told me that I didnt have any vacation time available. That I had taken my allotted days off already this year (I'm allowed 2 weeks time of what I work, so 2 weeks at 2 days a week meant I could take 4 day), 3 of those days that I had taken off this year were for my wife's doctors appointments (she is disabled) and one was for a funeral that I did.

He’s an eccentric extremely talented musician. He’s not for everyone, but I have always held him in high regard. When I was 16 my boyfriend slept with my best friend. The latter spilled the beans at a party. Word go out to dozens of people that knew me before it reached Charles. He went out of his way to find my number and told me, even though we weren’t close, and he was the only one who did.

Anyway, fast forward 9-10 years and he would still send me music he wrote. I would hype him up and encourage him.

One day he sent me a video of him playing guitar. I told him it was sick and he told me he wrote it. Keeping to character limit, on a second watch I noticed his fretwork didn’t quite match the sound so I did some googling. He had ripped the song from some band. The only thing original was the muted video

Me: Charles, why the fuck are you lying to me? 🙄 This is sad dude. / Lmao damn I guess I really am pretty naive.

C: Oh ok..

Me: I wouldn’t have even checked if your phony finger work wasn’t hot garbage. Like I’m pissed dude, don’t lie to me like that!

A little more was said but basically he got upset, I told him I understood he was upset, but he needed to own up and apologize. I also told him he frequently impressed me without lying. He blocked me. Later he unblocked me.

Me: Did you unblock me?

C: Of course / It’s nothing personal I just try to be around positivity and for some reason temporarily blocking people is how I cope. So.. sorry.

And then he sent me 2 more videos. At the time I didn’t listen to them, but it’s new stuff he made. I believe these ones were real, idk if that matters.

Me: Hm, okay. Well here’s something positive. I’m not going to tell anyone about this whole thing.

He blew up on me. The highlights were “just be my friend or shut the fuck up”, “I'm more talented than anybody you will ever know so go around and tell people whatever the fuck you want”, he said he didn’t like me anymore “because it was just that important to point out that I made a mistake. congratulations. I don't deserve to live obviously.”

Me (abridged): What happened to being about positivity? Like all I wanted was a genuine apology but you're attacking me instead. / I guess you took what I said as a veiled threat? It wasnt. I was just trying to say that maybe you had an embarrassing moment but I have always respected you since you told me about [cheating ex], so even though you simply cannot be held responsible for your actions and you're being mean to me, I'm going to take it on the chin and keep this between us.

My (27) spouse (30) and I have two children together, he has a child from a previous relationship: they are 1, 4 and 9.

My sister (19) helps out on the occasion, has been for 6 years now and it’s been a great help - she’ll usually spend the night around ours and do the school run, sometimes help at the weekends; longest she’s stayed to help has been a week? But she’s always volunteered to help, has been more than happy to help and is even going into teaching.

Children wanted to go to park, with me and my sister so we sort of turned it into a family thing, so everyone went to the park and played football, sister bought lunch and it was great fun…around 1 I told my partner I was cold; I did bring my coat out, but the dog jumped water up it, so it was essentially useless.

Then 1:30 my sister says she might head home because she’s cold, I had told her to wear a jacket and was ignored…my spouse immediately gives her his jacket? And I was so confused? Because when I complained I was cold it was ignored…no sense making drama in front of the children, we stayed till around 3 and then we dropped sister home.

I told my partner that I don’t understand when I say I’m cold it’s ignored but my sister says she’s cold and he, essentially, jumped to give her his jacket? I’ve never seen him move so fast! I am not uncomfortable with him being nice to my sister, she does a lot for us, it’s just the fact that I know he wouldn’t have done the same for me.

He asked me to say that I was sorry for doubting him, I did not.

He told me I’m overreacting and she’s younger and does a lot for us, and by me being upset I’m being an AH because he was being a gentleman and that I’m being insecure, towards who he sees as a child…he’s upset with me…he even texted my sister to complain, who then texted me to apologize and say she didn’t expect him to do that - but my mother sided with my partner saying we’re all family, it’s my fault for being insecure etc. (she’s mostly upset sister feels bad)

We’re talking walking into a room of fifty ferrets crazy…but these ones have mad cow. Nasty messages sent to me constantly, when blocked they just used their kids/friends phones, lies shared about me, my children and I stalked online, about the worst kind of psychological drama you could think of. I ignored it for the most part and didn’t talk to anyone about it but the times when my children were involved. I tried talking to my mom a few times in an effort to figure out how to deal with her. It was always the same thing ‘she wouldn’t do that’ or ‘she said she didn’t do that’, even when I provided clear proof. I stopped spending holidays with family, stopped going over to family dinners, et cetera. A few family members have recently found themselves in similar situations and have cut contact with this sibling as well. Of course this must be my fault, so I go through another barrage of nasty messages until one in particular, an anonymous text before the holiday encouraging me to ‘do the world and your kids a favor and’ it doesn’t take much to know where it went. I have a history of depression and my sibling knows that. This was the last straw. I filed a complaint with my phone company. Filed a police report so I could get a restraining order. Spent too much money trying to track the numbers details. Contacted support with the company I found and filed a request for data to be shared with the police. I’m still waiting on the 100% sure but it’s coming along that this sibling was behind it and my mom may be seeing it now I suppose because she’s suddenly interested in spending time with me. She has been reaching out more trying to get together. ‘I’ll do this’, ‘come over for dinner’, ‘let’s go to lunch’. I’m not interested. This sibling has caused nothing but problems and my family made me feel like I was the problem. I’m being told that IATA because my family could have felt torn between us and I never told them my side of it all. I understand feeling torn but I was never asked to discuss it. I was never asked if things were true(she called my ex and told him I committed fraud using his SSN…yes, that crazy…which was also proven a lie…but again ‘she didn’t say that’) I chose not to involve family because I didn’t think it was right, when I tried to show them the truth, I was rejected.

Then there are grandparents (on both sides) who live farther away and would like to be visited over the holiday. A few years ago, we flexed our schedule to accommodate all of Deb's ""known"" plans only to discover that on the evening of our family's celebration she was going to hang with friends 3 hrs. away.  I was VERY hurt. We have never insisted that we MUST get together on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day; but rather have chosen the date that works the best for the most people. DIL's family has a very specific Christmas Eve tradition that they ALWAYS adhere to. One of my other sons is married and he and his wife always bring their 2 dogs to Christmas (harder to do at a stranger's house). My third son has a crazy work schedule where he works 24 hrs. on/48 hrs. off (lots to accommodate).  I have asked that Dan and Deb compromise by prioritizing ONE event with EACH family that they will both attend together. Then they can divide the rest of their time as they choose. Deb's mother is weighing in, and when I told her my feelings she started saying things like ""well, I guess they will just go separately to things then.""

I asked her why, she said she ""doesn't think she'll be able to enjoy herself but wishes me well"".

I was kind of mad, but also hurt. Yes it's tragic what happened but she's built a great life for herself, yet she's going to hold onto the past like this and not show up to my wedding. D's also said she won't be staying for the reception, which came as a bit of a shock to me. My mom tried talking to them both, but no use, and she said M might be trying to guilt D into not coming when she at least has no reason to not come.

I told M that she could try and enjoy herself for my sake, and put my feelings over someone who's been dead for years.

M got upset, and she called me selfish and said she ""hopes I never have to go through what she did"". I did try and call her back, and sent her a message saying sorry because I realize I might've overreacted, but she didn't reply.

It was very clear due to the date of conception, when I was absent at the time. But I had to wait until after childbirth to get a court-ordered DNA test, as prenatal tests are banned in Germany. I got custody of my son Justin(9), and he gets to visit his mom and half-brother every 2 weeks, as was agreed in the family court.

While I am not part of Tim's life, nor do I want to care for him, I do accept him as my son's half-brother, and as such, he is allowed to visit us on special occasions.

About a month ago, Justin celebrated his birthday with some friends—about 15 people—and Tim and his mom were invited.

Tim loves to imitate Justin, so when Justin called me Papa, Tim did the same, to which I told him that I was not his papa, but he may call me by my real name. He then asked who my father is, to which I responded, ""I don't know, but your mother does."" So he went to his mom, who sent him back to me and said she doesn't know it either.

The problem is, Tim told it to his classmates, who were talking about their parents and got bullied because of it. It's also worth mentioning that he is attending a PBS in his city, and his class and school have many Muslims, so an archaic view on women and family is to be expected.

My ex called me not long after, yelled, and hurled insults at me, blaming me for what was happening to Tim. I just told her, ""That's your problem,"" and she should deal with it herself. I also told her that she should find the actual father of Tim, but as usual, she was like, ""I don't know."" But i don't buy it. How can a mother not know the father of her own child? She knows exactly who he is but she is concealing it for whatever reason, because a mother always knows the dad of her child.

My son became aware of what was going on and distanced himself from Tim because he did not want to be bullied alongside him.

This week, I offered for Tim to come visit us so he can go to the Christmas Market with us next month, but Justin didn't want him to come. My ex also complained multiple times about why I never bought Tim any food, gave him weekly pocket money like Justin, or ever gifted him anything, to which I responded, ""He is not my kid.""

Hurts Mom's feelings.

I [15 f] had two female mice that my mother got for me. These mice were hard to take care of. They needed to be cleaned about every week, needed a lot of money in bedding and food, and one of them didn't seem to be adjusting well to being a pet (they wouldn't come out. when they did, I couldn't pet them. the other was fine). Even in a pair like that, they required a lot of human socialization. I don't remember what the exact number was, but I was shooting for an hour a day. And they smelled.

After a while, it became clear to me that I simply wasn't responsible enough to care for these mice. So, I wanted to surrender them to a pet store, in the hopes they'd find someone who was.

I brought this idea up to my mom [30 something f]. She didn't like it, insisting that either she would take them or she'd give them to my siblings [9 and 6 f] and ""we'd"" take care of them.

While this sounds sensible, it's untrue. If you know anything about pet rodent care, you know that hamsters are easier to handle than mice. And the thing is, my mom has a hamster that she doesn't take care of. She hasn't cleaned his bedding in months. Sometimes, she gets so worried that he's dead, she sends in my 9 years old sister to check for her (and really, who would rather their 9 year old see that than them?). He's not dead because everyone else, especially my [40 something m] dad pitches in to help. Needless to say, giving away my mice to my sisters would also mean me taking care of them—they just wouldn't be ""mine"" anymore.

I decided to go with neither of those options. Instead, I told my dad what she had said, and he said the same things I was thinking about why those were terrible options. Then he said that, since she wouldn't let us, we should get rid of them while she was at work. And we did.

My mom says that we're the assholes for going behind her back to get rid of something she cared about. She insists that she does take care of her hamster. She also says that she spent a lot of money on them, which is true, probably somewhere in the $300 range. Then she mad some remark about me and Dad ""being a team now"" and how ""she doesn't want to be my friend"" (I didn't say anything along the lines of asking her to be). So we did hurt her by doing this.

(for context as to those last statements, their marriage is unhealthy and I hear the bad-mouthing from both sides. It damaged my relationship with them for many years, especially my dad. then Mom had multiple episodes of psychosis, which caused her to be put in mental hospitals on and off. without my mother there, i started to realize that my dad wasn't who she made him out to be, and we've grown a lot closer).

Things didn’t go well and I’m no longer friends with one, who we’ll call Lucy (I am still friends with the other roommate). 

Lucy was a demanding roommate, and she wasn’t happy with her bedroom or our house. She said her rent was too much, and I agreed to pay an additional $50/month because I considered us friends and wanted to live with her/help her out. Anytime Lucy bought something for the house (decor stuff) she made us pay her back without consulting us beforehand. Other roommate thought this was ridiculous so I ended up paying Lucy bc I wanted to keep the peace. 

She was extremely passive aggressive to me. She told me I “never cleaned” (not true), made “jokes” to other roommate about how I “only leave my room for food” and about my dating life, and complained it was my fault we lived in this house and she had the worst bedroom (I found the house on Zillow but we all agreed to live here, and she had the lowest budget so got the smallest room, not sure why that is my fault). 

I got the memo that she didn’t really like me and we weren’t friends. I was friendly around the house but we didn’t talk otherwise. 

One day she texted me accusing my cat of “destroying” a bunch of her stuff, and I needed to reimburse her. I was upset bc she had ever said anything before and I had no idea (Other roommate did not have any complaints about cat). When I looked at the “destroyed” items they weren’t damaged, and some were in a cat my spot couldn’t physically reach. Think fabric bins from Target that have a minuscule thread sticking out but look new (owed her $40 bc she “saw him scratching them”), and a yoga mat with a pin sized hole that she said he scratched. I was so fed up from everything else with her we got into a huge argument and I told her she clearly didn’t like me. She “had no idea” why I thought that. 

I moved my cat to my parents house and reimbursed her $150 (she continued to use all the “destroyed” items for the rest of the lease). I never reached out and neither did she. 

It ruined our friend group, and a lot of people are mad at me. People wanted me to apologize for getting mad at her, but after all her nasty comments and paying her $150, then $600 in extra rent I wasn’t going to apologize.

My(26F) sister's(28F) friend(26F) recently started a business in photography. She asked if she could use my son as a guinea pig. Which I agreed to. There was no photo contract or payment of any kind. When it came time to do the shoot our schedules didn't align so my mom took him to get pictures done. When agreeing to be a guinea pig I said she could post the final product on her website and Facebook.
 I went to update my family the photos were on Facebook. My sister said she got the link to all the pictures already from her friend. When I expressed how I wasn't okay with the link being given to anyone but me. I got back lash from my sister and the photographer. As I didn't provide a contract stating the link should only go to me. Sense I was okay with her posting the pictures on her website and Facebook I had no right to get upset about who the link went too. AITA for thinking the link of my son's photos should only go to me or my husband despite not coming up with a written contract saying so?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4837131,public,top,self,AITA: For getting upset when my photographer gave out the link to my son's photos,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7um5w/aita_for_getting_upset_when_my_photographer_gave/,all_ads,6,,,,

In October my grandfather passed away from cancer and in May my father had a heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery. I go to college out of state from where my family is, and in both of these situations I was the last one to know about them due to a decision made by my mother \[51F\]. My bedroom at my home, since I don't live there regularly anymore, is used as the guest room where my grandmother \[75F\] stays when she visits now that she's without my grandfather.

When my father had his heart attack, I came home from college as fast as I could but not before my grandmother had already arrived at my house with no scheduled departure date. I got home, already upset that the fact that my father was in the hospital after having a heart attack and that fact was kept from me until everyone else was aware, and was told by my mother that I would be staying in the basement where I would have to sleep on the couch for the foreseeable future as no one knew when my grandmother was leaving. My father ended up being in the hospital for a little over 3 weeks and my grandmother did not leave my home until the end of June.

A few days after being home, having to figure out how to get the rest of my finals done from home and helping my siblings deal with the fact that my dad was having dangerous surgery and not dealing with my emotions about it on top of sleeping on the couch, I was feeling very angry and upset about the situation and I know I was in the wrong about how I handled this conversation because I was very angry and upset and screamed at my mom ( I've apologized profusely for how I acted towards her in that moment) while crying.

My grandmother was in the room and inserted herself into the conversation, yelling at me that I was being too harsh because this isn't such a big deal and that my mother was having a rough year because she lost her father this year and now her husband is in the hospital and all I care about is having my bedroom back after I had said that it was feeling like I was a guest in my own home living out of boxes and suitcases and on a couch. She was crying and making me feel like my feelings about this were invalid, saying many things that hurt me deeply and I broke and said things I regretted (again I have apologized profusely for this) but my grandmother has not let me live down the fact that I was upset that she was staying with us to give my mom help while my dad was sick (even though all she did was judge all our decisions, sit on the couch and complain, and call everyone she could possibly think of and tell them every personal detail about what my family was going through at the time). She never apologized.

We all laughed and then our friend Eden said “wait I think we should do that” and we all laughed again. Then without missing a beat, Eden got up and farted on a little boy, about 5 years old. He got very upset then his mom started shouting at us and said she’d report us to the transport police. We all apologised and asked her not to but she refused.

When we got off the train we all had a go at Eden for farting on a literal child and getting us in trouble.
