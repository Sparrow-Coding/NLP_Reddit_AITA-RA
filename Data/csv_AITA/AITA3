My wife really doesn’t like to cook so in our marriage, I do most of the cooking. So when her parents announced a month ago that their thanksgiving will be potluck, I knew I was in for the cooking duty. My wife spoke with her family then told me that we’ll be bringing the turkey. I’m okay with it and I asked how many people are coming so I’ll know how much to cook. After some discussions, I found out that there will be about 30 people but not everyone like turkey so we settled on me cooking 2 turkeys. Other people will bring other meaty dishes.

I bought the turkeys, ingredients, and made preparations to cook the turkeys tomorrow morning in time for dinner. 10 minutes ago her parents called and said some people said they can’t cook their promised dishes and if I could cook more. She gave me a list:

1. Pot roast
2. Potato dish
3. My famous stir fried green beans
4. A cake 

I looked at the list, looked at her, looked at the list again, and said no. At this point, they’re basically asking me to cook an entire meal. I asked if they’re short on dishes because people are not coming. She answered that people are still coming but life came up and they couldn’t cook. I asked what came up but she doesn’t know. I told her if they’re coming, they can buy restaurant dishes to bring. She said I have all day to prepare and I’m cooking tomorrow anyway. 

I refused and before we could argue, I left and am sitting at the coffee shop writing this.

Later after her friend had texted me and I was there my daughter told me they tried to leave and the girl yelled at them to stop(which I understand why they weren’t allowed to leave on their own) and my daughter asked if I had to come in to get them, the lady said that she would just walk them up to the car, while she was walking my daughter and her friend to the car she kept asking them why they were leaving, my daughter said  that they were only allowed to stay for an hour-which I was fine with her saying even though they could’ve stayed longer if they wanted- and apparently the chaperone had also made some comments about how the girls had lied to them about having their phones when she saw the friend had pulled out her phone to check the time- my daughter and her friend never used their phones the entire time they were in the dance and my daughter had said she just wanted to go home and that no incident had occurred that made her want to go home.

It developed back in March and I haven’t been the same since. I haven’t been able to leave my apartment since May and I go into really bad panic attacks when someone comes into my apartment. I don’t have access to a therapist and so I don’t know how to learn coping mechanisms or anything to try to overcome this. I live with my bf, D (23) and we’ve been together for 4 years. I also don’t have a good relationship with his family. I’ll try to keep this as simple as possible but I’ve always felt excluded by them. They’re Honduran and so they speak Spanish at home but I always felt they never made any effort to speak English around me. They’ve also made a lot of rude and nasty comments behind my back and idk if D stands up for me. He says he does but I’m not sure. Last Christmas was so bad that I wanted to leave early and I finally put my foot down that I wouldn’t see them unless I had to (such as holidays) but this was before I became agoraphobic. 

So the issue was that D’s brother C messaged him out of the blue last night at 10:30. They haven’t spoken in a long time so this caught us off guard. C just said he wanted to drive down (he lives 2 hours away) to see D and ask for a favor. I immediately broke down into tears at the thought of someone being here in the apartment. I had a really bad panic attack last night. D pretty much just said that “ it’s his brother and I should just start learning to get over my issues”. I’m paraphrasing but it was along those lines. Well this caused a massive fight between us. I tried to suggest that they go out for coffee or brunch this morning instead. I tried to explain that I want to compromise and want him to have relationships with his family but I don’t know how to deal with my problems. We both vented about how my anxiety has really messed up our relationship and that was it. 

This morning he leaves to have coffee and at about 10am while they’re out, D says that C needs his laptop do some school work and will be coming by until his 3pm class to use it. Well again I went into another pretty bad panic attack. I told D that after last night, it wasn’t fair of him to just bring C here knowing how badly it affects me. I asked why C didn’t use his own computer at home? No response. I asked why C doesn’t go to his college campus a few blocks away from us? C doesn’t want to pay for campus parking. I suggested that D come home to grab his laptop and go to Starbucks or something so that C can use it and they can still spend time together. D agreed but now he’s super mad at me. He said that I don’t care about family, that he’s at least willing to help his family out, that he doesn’t see why I find the situation to be a bit weird. He left without saying goodby or anything.

He was not involved much when I was a kid until he and my mom got married when I was 8. Before then, he would show up sometimes to pick me up for scheduled visits, but other times would flake completely. He missed a birthday of mine to hang out with his brother, etc. Overall, he just never seemed like a reliable person to me. When he and my mom married things became more stable and we lived together in the same home. My mom passed when I was a teen and our relationship became a bit stronger as I feel we relied on each other during that time. 

Fast forward and I am now married with kids of my own. I live a couple of hours away from my dad and he does not drive so it is difficult to see him much. He is a heavy smoker and I do not feel comfortable taking my kids to his house. My in laws do not live far from my Dad and have offered to pick him up on the weekends when they drive to our house to see the kids, but my dad never takes them up on the offer. This past summer was my oldest child’s birthday and I arranged for my in laws to pick up my dad and bring him to our house for the party and also to take him back home that evening as he is not comfortable staying over. I was excited because it had been a year since I saw my dad since he does holidays with my sibling and I was very uncomfortably pregnant most of last year and unable to drive to see him while also caring for my other child. 

My dad called me the day before the party to let me know that he felt uncomfortable driving with my in laws and wouldn’t be coming to the birthday. I was very angry and told him it made me upset that he couldn’t be uncomfortable for a couple hours to see family he hadn’t seen in a year. I think I made him mad because since then he has not called or texted (though he would rarely do that anyway). Since that time I gave birth to another baby and I have sent him photos.

I alternate which breast I give them, and pump/catch milk from the other breast. Baby drinks some pumped milk (via bottle/husband), and we freeze the rest as backup. Our freezer is fully stocked so have been throwing the extra away.

The amount we 'waste' each day varies but it's at least a full meal or two. I  looked into donating it but:

·       cost/admin/storage of extra breastmilk bags

·       freezer space (buying a new freezer)

·       time/energy to decant/label/freeze/store breastmilk

·       extra effort for higher hygiene (sterilising vs our cleaning standards)

·       milk bank’s ‘screening’ tests (questionnaires/blood tests)

·       transport time/cost to drop off milk (with a baby)

·       buying/storing a cooler to transport the milk

·       remembering to ‘dump’ any milk pumped within a certain timeframe if I’d done anything the bank won’t accept (alcohol/medication/illness etc)

It’s a lot of extra time, mental load, inconvenience and effort that I just don’t want to deal with while caring for a baby.

Anyway, last month my heavily pregnant SIL (friendly but not close friends) noticed me dumping milk and asked why - I told her the reasons above. She asked if I would donate to her; I told her I’d think about it.

I’ve decided I don’t want to- we don’t see her regularly enough to fit it into an established routine/live an hour away via public transport. I would 100% do this if there was medical need (premature/intolerant to formula) or if she was trying to breastfeed but was unable to. SIL chose to formula feed her first child from day 1 saying “I don’t want to breastfeed / my body my choice / fed is best / formula is just as good as breastmilk etc” - all valid reasons and fine by me.

I called and politely told her I would not be able to donate, and was surprised when her whole tone changed to obviously VERY annoyed/angry/upset. She said that I was being unreasonable and that family should support each other. I clarified that if there was medical need I would do it, but not otherwise. We went back and forth before I got frustrated and said I don’t understand why you want my breastmilk when you’ve always said formula is just as good. She replied she can’t believe how selfish, judgemental and bitchy I’m being and hung up.

My husband thinks SIL is being hypocritical/hormonal; her husband thinks it’s a ‘small sacrifice’ for a ‘big benefit’. My friends are split with some being UTTERLY DISGUSTED that I am throwing away ‘liquid gold’ and am MORALLY OBLIGATED to donate surplus milk for innocent babies (milk banks/SIL).

I would never say this to a non-breastfeeding mother but I do actually think breastmilk is better than formula (immunity etc) so understand why they want it. But I also don't think it's my responsibility to feed other people's babies when formula is a viable and reasonable option!

My department is understaffed and mostly non-religious. We get relentlessly pestered into participating. Last year we came up with a very specific pun theme relating to our floor. It was clever and we worked hard on it while still being swamped and generally not in the spirit. No other groups had any sort of theme to speak of. Even marketing didn't find a way to make theirs cohesive or clever.

We got robbed. Unsurprisingly, the department doing the judging won.

Ok, whatever.

We just got the notice about this year's competition. It is being judged by the same group. We're still not into it, but now we're salty.

My team is generally considered unfriendly grinches as it is. We're LPC, so we're used to being avoided. We're also usually here after most groups leave, or before most groups get in for the day. We are perfectly poised to literally steal Christmas, and the most unexpected to do so.

The tentative plan is to set up a half-assed display of our own ahead of time, but the night before/morning of the competition stealing decor from the other floors and displaying it on our own with various Grinch-themed stuff. 

-We will not damage anything, and it will be noted one where it came from so it can be returned.
-Nothing hand-crafted or delicate will be moved.
-We will photograph the displays before removing anything so the groups still have a shot at competing.

Given the above, would we be the assholes? I guess this could be considered revenge, but I think of it as friendly competition.

So over the weekend, Me and my buddy(Both M), let’s call us Tom and Jerry, were to get food in the city. Both of us had been going through some shit with out other friend and were having a bad week, so we decided to grind out the day with overdue school work and then in the night we’d head to the city to grab dinner at my sanctuary food place. I decided to invite my other friend (F), let’s call her Sandy, who was home alone, as the rest of our friends all had plans, to eat with us. Our other friend(F), let’s call her pearl, was also out in the city with some of her and her bf’s other friends. She calls us and tells us to join her after dinner to hangout.       
Me and jerry just wanted a chill night, get some of our favorite food and head back to our dorms to just relax. So we initially said no, and then after her insisting for a while, we said we would decide and see after dinner. So we get to our food place, waiting in line in the cold outside for about 45 minutes in. Pearl calls Sandy, and she’s upset about something, Sandy doesn’t question her and says she’s going to leave and go check on Pearl. Then we ask her if it’s an emergency, and if we should come along, and Sandy says she’s not sure but she makes a very worried face but initially decides that she will go alone and call us if she needs. She calls an Uber, and about a minute after leaving in the Uber, she calls Jerry and tells him Pearl wants all of us to come, so me and Jerry assuming it’s an emergency, don’t think twice and just get in the Uber. We get down to Pearl and she is just wasted but nothing was wrong, she just wanted us there, I’m not sure why. This pissed me off, and eventually after about an hour or so, me and Jerry just head back to our dorms, while Sandy and Pearl stay to party. I was pissed off at this point, but gave her the benefit of the doubt that maybe something was wrong. The next day, I asked Pearl what happened, and asked her why she called us if there was no emergency and she said she was just upset about something, and wanted us to come. When I told her it bothered me that my plans were altered(yes I chose those words carefully) she basically insinuated that I didn’t have to come and how I was basically picking food over a friend. I told her, I wouldn’t have been bothered if there was a real emergency, and after that the convo just ended with her going to sleep and giving me the cold shoulder for the next two days to follow. I asked her if she was mad yesterday, and she said just disappointed. Am I the asshole here, because from my POV she ruined MY night, so I felt appropriate calling her out on it.

I had made plans to go to my mom's house towards the end of the weekend to help with some chores and spend an afternoon with her. Before I even asked my girlfriend if I could borrow her car in order to go to my mom's house, she had offered to let me use her car for the day, saying she wouldn't need it that day. Super nice of her, and I was very grateful.

When I get in her car to go to my mom's house, I notice the gas tank is just over a quarter full - plenty to get to my mom's house as it is about 10 miles away. Since my girlfriend was kind and let me borrow my car, I wanted to help in some way, so instead of filling the tank, I had her car washed instead. It had been at least a month since she last had her car washed, and I spent more time washing her car than I normally spend washing my own. I take the car to my mom's, bring it back and return the keys to my girlfriend, and I thought that would be it.

Fast forward to last night, my girlfriend and I are coming home from dinner with her parents, with us driving her car (since mine is still at the mechanic's). She makes a sarcastic comment at some point along the lines of ""Oh, thanks for filling up my car when you used it a few days ago."" I mention to her that instead of filling up the tank, I washed her car as a way of saying thank you for letting me borrow it. She replies with ""Thanks, but normally when someone borrows someone else's car, they fill it up when they're done. And you left me nearly on empty."" I responded with ""I understand that's normally what people do, but since I only used it for one trip, and since you were already pretty low when I needed to use it, I didn't think I should have to fill nearly your entire tank (probably about $50). And when I got home, the gauge said just under a quarter tank, plenty to get you to work and back the next day. That's why I washed it instead."" She replies ""Well in the future, if you need to borrow my car, please fill it when you're done."" Wanting to avoid arguing, I just said ""Okay, will do"" and left it at that. 

We didn't go to bed that night angry or anything, but it still rubbed me the wrong way. I fully acknowledge that the convention when borrowing a car is to fill the tank up when you return it, but the reasons I didn't think that necessary/justified in this situation: 1) I only needed it one trip on one day for a few hours, a total of no more than 20 miles. 2) I had it washed instead, still spending time and money on it to show my appreciation. 3) Filling up the tank all the way would have cost much more than the gas that I used, and with having to buy a new catalytic converter for my own car, I'm trying to be careful with money for the next month or two.

I need an outsider's opinion because I feel like I'm going insane. I (20M) was about to bathe when my father (51M) wanted to find more shows on Netflix because he just finished one he likes. So as I'm scrolling through the selection, the thumbnails wouldn't load. My father and I realize that what's happening is an annoyingly common occurrence, which is the internet router malfunctioning for whatever reason.

I go to restart the router by unplugging it and plugging it in again. After almost a year of this problem occurring so often, I've learned how to do it fast. Apparently so fast, that my father did not see that I did exactly that, and yells for me to unplug it. 

Now, throughout my entire life, my father has been a very hotheaded person. It doesn't take much for him to get in a rage and start hurling curse words, threatening to sell our valuables, and saying generally very hurtful things. Not doing what you're told immediately is a surefire way to get him into such a state. Whenever we call him out on such behavior, he always turns it back around on us and how it's our fault he gets angry. 

Knowing all this, I decided to test him. I wanted to see how he would react if I didn't follow one of his orders for around a minute. So I just stood there, texting someone because the connection was already restored. He keeps yelling, getting angrier and angrier, and less than thirty seconds in, he gets up from the couch and storms into his room. I check multiple devices, the PS5 he was watching on and even his cellphone which he left on the couch, and sure enough, they were all connected proving I really did unplug the router.  

I get mad because I'm really fed up with his impatient and mean behavior. He comes back out to get his phone, and as he goes back to his room, I tell him that I already did as he said and the connection was back, but he wouldn't hear me out and curses at me as I'm speaking, multiple times. (The English equivalent would be something like F*CK YOU)

Now I feel bad for upsetting him, and I'm sure if I told other family members they'd say it was my fault for testing him, and not responding when he was giving me an order. I just wanted to prove that he prioritizes getting angry and yelling at me over being patient.

But the thing didn't go well. I don't exactly know what happened after reporting, but the cop decided to not interfere any further than investigating what's going on. 

Few hours later, she called me crying, said she treated like a traitor and that she stabbed behind her parent simply because I reported cop; had to explain that she's innocent thus stop treating like a traitor to her mother. I have to say her mother is next-leveled obnoxious, hypocrite material.

Later that day, the friend told me her mother is going to call me over lawsuit for false accusation. At this moment I was just so speechless and mind-blown, that I even got confused if that's actually possible. Thanks to local law firm for confirming that's such reckless attempt for her!

Most of the time I’m good with my irritability but recently I’ve been kinda lashing out at her because her negativity is rubbing off on me and I can’t have a good day when Im always hearing about her problems. 

     It’s gotten to the point where when she comes to me I’m just nonchalant and mellow and just let her talk because it doesn’t matter what I say I don’t understand what she’s going through to her. I’ve told her I think she should start going to therapy but she says she can’t afford it right now which I understand cause times have gotten more rough but I don’t know what else to do.

I will just mention today's incident. (This is gonna be a long one though.)

So I'm constantly fighting with myself to either talkt about sth with my gf or keep it to myself.

I'm studying and am currently in my masters, my gf is on the list to get into therapy.

I have a good relationship with the last bit of my family (grandfather and grandmother).
Every one or two weeks I visit them to help them kn the household. Both of them don't have a lot of money due to the prices (especially gas for heating). My grandfather called me and offered me to get a new phone, since his contract is running out. I declined and rather asked him to get me some tobacco instead.
I talked to my gf about it and she said that I should rather take the phone, so she can get a new one, we sell her old one so we have some money to spare.
I denied that and she went off at me.

I simply didn't want to burden my grandparents with more costs, because no phone = less cost.

First conclict over.

Then afterwards shes sad because I was ""mean"" to her and she accused me of being mean when she's in a bad mood. No offense but she is diagnosed with depression. There is barely any time to rssomve issues since she mostly is in a bad mood and when she's in a good mood, I don't want to ruin it.
But at the same time there is no direct problem solving, because of her mood.
I'm diagnosed too, but not officially and she tends to forget that since ""You don't have anything"".
But there's also a lot of pressure on me additionally.
I'd like to go into therapy, but I can't.

I'm likely going to inherit and have to pay off other people from that. I'm at the end of my masters and almost finished with uni. And all financial resources are on me. I can't kick my feet back and focus on recovery so I'm just wondering if all this is fair and I'm simply being an asshole, or if I got at least some points right here.

AITA? F(69) I grew up with playing card games. Some of my best childhood memories are playing cards with my grandmother. My spouse M(67) grew up in a religion that says playing with face cards are literally evil. Occasionally he will play face card games at someone else’s house to be respectful. Recently I purchased several packs of face cards to play card games with the grandkids.  After looking for them in the game closet I realized he threw them away. This is not the first time he has done that. I have tried talking to him about it several times through the years. He just says he won’t have them in his house.  Many people in his religion do play with face cards. He states he learned different and his church rules agree with him. To be fair the citations of what he shows for “rules” are fairly old. ( More than 30 years old) These rules are not followed by many in the congregation anymore. Seriously how is go fish or spoons evil? Am I the asshole to him by buying the cards and placing them in the house? Is he the asshole to me in not seeing my values do not include face cards being evil and wanting to play card games with my grandkids? Are we both assholes because we cannot come to an agreement?

Every time we disagree on the smallest thing, she calls me toxic or a narcissist and blocks me. She then unblocks me when she needs something. 

I love my sister, but this is affecting my mental health. She says really hurtful things and never apologizes. She just acts like nothing happened. I was a little of a push over when we were younger but now, I've started to put boundaries with various people in my life. 

A few weeks ago, she blocked me. I reached out and asked for boundaries so that we may have a healthy relationship. And she told me ""Nope I want no contact with you""

The same night she unblocks me and asks for something.

My husband got me A to help me deal with depression from not being able to conceive and she has helped my mental health tremendously.

My (43f) brother (39m) had a falling out in the summer of 2020, leading him to proclaim me ""dead to him"" Sept 2020. The falling out was that I was no longer discreet when I told him to stop lying about serving in the military, and to stop wearing MY service for his stolen valor. 

After years of taking him aside and telling him to stop with the stolen valor, and telling my stories as if they were his, I may have been TA when the last straw came, and I called him on his BS in front of his estranged daughter (that he hadn't seen since an infant, now 19, and he was trying to impress her with the lying). 

Previous to this occasion I had been discreetly taking him aside to tell him about his BS, only to be brushed off. Shortly after this occasion, my brother had gone around to all friends and family asking for ""donations towards a house"" only to turn around and go on vacations to multiple theme parks, buy a new truck, and a few ATV's. I jokingly pointed out how much of a POS move that was to manipulate people out their money with another lie about a ""house"" only for them to fund his lifestyle. It was then that he proclaimed I was ""dead to him"" and we haven't spoken since. He never shows up to gatherings when invited by ANY other family member either, due to the fact that myself and my older brother will be in attendance. He doesn't speak to older brother either for different reasons.

My mother, however, expects me to continue to invite him to EVERY family gather, I've done so for all gatherings and holidays for all of 2021 and 2022 so far. I did invite him, with no response. I never expected one, I was just placating my mom. 

I told her that I would not extend any invitations for the holidays this year. My mother told me that I needed to move past this and reconcile with my brother and continue to extend the olive branch and ""one day he'll come around"". I told her that I had nothing that needed reconciling and that he was the one that needed to grow up and get over himself, and until he does, I won't be the one reaching out any longer.

So over the weekend, Me and my buddy(Both M), let’s call us Tom and Jerry, were to get food in the city. Both of us had been going through some shit with out other friend and were having a bad week, so we decided to grind out the day with overdue school work and then in the night we’d head to the city to grab dinner at my sanctuary food place. I decided to invite my other friend (F), let’s call her Sandy, who was home alone, as the rest of our friends all had plans, to eat with us. Our other friend(F), let’s call her pearl, was also out in the city with some of her and her bf’s other friends. She calls us and tells us to join her after dinner to hangout.       
Me and jerry just wanted a chill night, get some of our favorite food and head back to our dorms to just relax. So we initially said no, and then after her insisting for a while, we said we would decide and see after dinner. So we get to our food place, waiting in line in the cold outside for about 45 minutes in. Pearl calls Sandy, and she’s upset about something, Sandy doesn’t question her and says she’s going to leave and go check on Pearl. Then we ask her if it’s an emergency, and if we should come along, and Sandy says she’s not sure but she makes a very worried face but initially decides that she will go alone and call us if she needs. She calls an Uber, and about a minute after leaving in the Uber, she calls Jerry and tells him Pearl wants all of us to come, so me and Jerry assuming it’s an emergency, don’t think twice and just get in the Uber. We get down to Pearl and she is just wasted but nothing was wrong, she just wanted us there, I’m not sure why. This pissed me off, and eventually after about an hour or so, me and Jerry just head back to our dorms, while Sandy and Pearl stay to party. I was pissed off at this point, but gave her the benefit of the doubt that maybe something was wrong. The next day, I asked Pearl what happened, and asked her why she called us if there was no emergency and she said she was just upset about something, and wanted us to come. When I told her it bothered me that my plans were altered(yes I chose those words carefully) she basically insinuated that I didn’t have to come and how I was basically picking food over a friend. I told her, I wouldn’t have been bothered if there was a real emergency, and after that the convo just ended with her going to sleep and giving me the cold shoulder for the next two days to follow. I asked her if she was mad yesterday, and she said just disappointed. Am I the asshole here, because from my POV she ruined MY night, so I felt appropriate calling her out on it.

Years ago I found such a love for being a part of the atmosphere of game day. The pregame rituals, the chants and the cheers. It’s genuinely one of my favorite things in the world to go to and be a part of! I even graduated from the university.

Now, being part of that atmosphere for me was also standing up and cheering on the team. We’ve had quite a few down years, so the fan base has seemed to be a bit less engaged which imo is totally fine person to person. 

But on 3rd down with the game on the line, I expect everyone in the stadium to be standing, roaring, and willing the team to get a big stop! 

AITA for taking part in this tradition of standing up throughout the game? I mean commercial breaks I’ll sit down, but when the teams return to the field I think it’s well within my right as a paying member of the crowd to root on my team as I see fit.

There is one boy in this group that has ADHD that apparently makes him impulsive. The impulsive behavior has led to him saying wildly inappropriate things, and last year for a good while he targeted my son and was very mean to him in the group. At one point my son decided to stop engaging with the group all together and played by himself a lot.

After some time he returned to the group and all seemed fine. This year though, this boy has decided he has a new target of another boy in the group. That boy also decided to leave the group for a little bit, and when he left the group my son started to hang out with him. Probably because he understood what he was going through - after all last year he was in that exact spot.

As a result of the two boys now hanging out, all the neutral parties started to skew to these two boys that were hanging out with them instead and at one point the ""mean"" boy was left out. This continued for about a month...

The mean boy's mom started getting involved and trying to get everyone to call/hang out. It was then that I tried to let her know this was happening because of the way her son treats some kids. She used ADHD as the reason that he is impulsive and lacks social skills, and stated we all need to have grace towards him because he is going through severe anxiety and depression. When I named the things her son did to the boys, she basically states ""they are boys and all do it to each other.""

Well... I'm sorry but I am not going to subject my child to continued mean behavior. I told my son he does NOT have to be friends with someone who is mean or makes him uncomfortable. He must always be kind, but you don't have to be friends. I told him mommy and dad support his decision and we trust his judgement. As a result, my son continues not to join any group calls if he is on, and does not choose to invite him if we do anything outside of school. AM I THE ASSHOLE FOR LETTING MY CHILD DECIDE FOR HIMSELF WHO HE WANTS TO BE FRIENDS WITH? 

I just don't want my son to think his feelings don't matter and I'd rather keep the peace than respect how he feels around this kid.

She argues that i should've bought the laptop with my own money, and she's talked to two of her friends and they agree with her.

She backs her argument by saying that they're going to find the budget for me because they like me and that i just got a big raise a couple of months ago, and I'm exploiting this.

I've tried explaining to her that I've basically negotiated for a better bonus, that I am not deceiving anyone or lying to anyone to get what I want. I've even offered to pay out of pocket for the difference.

She seems to hold this sentiment very strongly, and has told me ""Am I marrying a thief ?"".

I hate cats. I think their litter boxes are gross and I can’t stand the smell of cat urine. Also, everyone involved in this situation are adults.

Now that I’ve gotten that out of the way, here’s my problem. 

My parents are hosting thanksgiving this year and they invited immediate and extended family, it’s going to be huge. My siblings and I own our own houses so we’re splitting up out of town family members so no one will have to overpay for hotel rooms. I’m hosting the single cousins so they can have a little fun outside of family time.

My cousins started to arrive yesterday. Shelby arrived and when I opened the door, I saw her standing there with a big smile, her luggage, and a pet carrier. I pointed to the carrier and asked what’s that. She happily told me that she just adopted a cat and didn’t want to leave it at home with her roommates. I stood at the door for too long without letting her in so things got awkward.

I admit I didn’t have a no pets rule but I didn’t think I had to. I thought that asking the host if they’re cool with pets before bringing them was one of those unwritten rules that people just automatically follow. You know, like you don’t have to tell every adult coming into your house not to pee in the kitchen sink. Besides, no one else brought their pets and a couple of them own dogs.

Finally she asked if she could come in and that brought me back to my senses. I told her I don’t allow pets in my house and that her cat can’t come in. She thought I was joking but when I didn’t move, we started to argue. The other cousins came to see what the commotion was about and in the end, a couple of cousins left with her while the rest remain.

My parents called to chew me out saying that I could have put up with Shelby and her cat for a couple of days while I argue that it’s rude to bring a pet without asking first. Plus I don’t want my house to smell like cat urine. They said I’m making thanksgiving awkward and now I feel a little bad. I don’t feel bad enough to let Shelby and her cat in thought.

I got this email yesterday:

From Cousin: *I heard you're ""wishing me well"" - I didn't think you believed 'thoughts and prayers' were helpful. You should have at least said something to me since I'm the one going through it.* 

I responded: *Cousin - I am truly sorry you're going through all of this but I didn't want to disrespect your continued wishes to have distance from us. If you want to reach out or you need something from me, please let me know. I love you and hope you get through this.*

Here's where I may be the asshole - 

Cousin: *I did reach out but you're still mad and I don't have time for that drama in my life.* 

My response: *K.*

I admit to being irritated that she reached out with the email she did and the way she did it, and while I can understand she's going through a lot and maybe wanting contact - I didn't know what to do with her email. I tried to remedy her frustrations and it pissed her off and I just threw up my hands and said - fucking fine then.

There's never any fights at our family get togethers, so i figured it was just a fun little game.

We’ve had our ups and downs and we’re still a close knit group and that matters a lot to me. 

Previously we’ve had numerous fights about me getting upset over the fact they don’t talk to me like they used to or do with each other. Although there’s no reason of them not talking to me but it was the pandemic when the college was closed and we didn’t meet often and hence the difference. 

Inspite of that, I’m always there for them whenever they needed and talk to them regularly. As a normal decency and friendship I just expect them to reply to texts when or be the first one to talk to me occasionally (I feel it’s always me who talks or texts first). This year they got an apartment together near my house and I helped them with shifting, driving around and stuff. After those few days, I felt they’re acting distant with me, so I confronted them bout as to why don’t they text me or talk to me even tho I am always there for them. 
And they felt like I’m counting favours I did for them and making our friendship a formality.

They say I always play the victim and lash out on them frequently.

But here’s my side of story, I am at an extremely lonely phase in my life and they’re the only friends I have whom I can physically meet. Sometimes they’re super close and I look at them as my sisters but sometimes they do not even bother to talk to me for weeks. They say it’s unintentional and they’re busy with somethings and they’re into texting friends and checking up on friends. 

I know they don’t mean it intentionally but when someone close to me leaves my texts on seen, it hurts me a lot and affects me for 3-4 days where I constantly keep thinking what did I do wrong, why hasn’t this person replied. 

And with this attached and detached friendship I was extremely exhausted and decided to ignore them in college today and the next thing I know is they’re blaming me of hurting them, playing victim and being a bad person.

We eventually dropped the tv because we didn’t use it. Then last year we moved and didn’t need the internet portion anymore either, so dropped that as well. Now it is just the bill for cell phones. 

Also several years ago my sister was going through a separation/divorce and hard money times. To save her money my husband and I decided to add her to our phone plan. The way it was set up we pay $120 (plus tax/fees) for the plan, and then $20 a line. Plus of course if any line has insurance or a phone payment that costs extra. It was a good deal way back in the day since it was unlimited and all. We only ever charge my sister the price of her line (about $25) and the price of her phone payment. Which at the time they had buy one get one free so me and her did that and split the cost of the bought phone, which has since been paid off. 

So for several years now my husband has paid $90.50 plus his insurance and phone payment when he had it. I paid $115.50 (I pay for a line for my grandma) and my half of the phone payment. And my sister paid $25 plus a half phone payment till it was paid off. We never complained or asked her to pay more.

Well now we need new phones (especially my grandma) and there’s better phone deals out there. There’s a new plan where you pay per line and each line chooses which level works for them ($50,$40,$35) plus a deal where you can get a new phone for $5. So while my sisters bill would go up $15 ish dollars, my husbands would drop $35 ish and mine would drop $25 and we’d save money overall.

My sister is in a better spot now, she’s remarried. They have a two income household (though he doesn’t make as much as he can and they put wants above need a lot). But none the less I don’t feel like it’s terrible to ask her to finally pay more towards her part so we can finally save some. However she kind of freaked out when I brought it up. So Aita?

They were constantly yelling at each other, so it was a little easier for me, but I missed my dad. The court decided that I would go to dads place every weekend. 

Right now I'm at his place almost every weekend because all my books are at my mom's place and there's no reason for me to carry them when me and dad just talk while I'm at his place and hang out. Ever since I turned 10, they've been saying bad things about each other. It was very uncomfortable at first, but I got used to it.

The problem is, every time mom asks me what we talked about, and I have to say ""about school"" because dad always tells me that, when he insults mom, to keep it between us and not tell her. Mom does the same. There were more than a hundred times when I wanted to tell them what we were actually talking about, but I have a feeling that then I would be in trouble. Because my mom can kick me out of the house (because I'm with her most of the time)and I'm only 15 with no job (I can work at 16 tho), and I'm afraid that my dad will hate me like he hates my half-brother V. (all I know about him is that he's 19 years older than me and that he works with computers. )

So, WIBTAif I told them what the other actually said? I'm they're kid for crying out loud. I don't wanna see them fight like back then, but I feel sooo guilty for staying silent for so long (5 years). 

Btw each time I even attempt to defend either one of them I get yelled at and they always say ""if you love  your mom/dad soo much you can stay with that (bad words/slures) of a failure and then I can only pray that you don't end up like that (more slures/bad words)!!!""

Before this mom was a cleaner, and she got really bad arthritis and was severely depressed because of the job. Drinking, smoking, the whole lot. I was happy to be able to get her out of that spot. It’s really once in a lifetime cause she has no education.

He sees I’m devastated over the possibility of my mom not having a job and falling back into a depression.

Now it's important to note, I currently do not work, I did in the past, but during my last internship found it hard to balance the hours, and as I have another one in the new year, I thought best to dedicate myself to my final semester. I do however maintain the house. 

As such, I operate very different hours from the boys. They are early risers, and usually out of the house before six. But my schedule has me doing study in the day, classes in the evenings and my general socialisation in the nights. 

Now we have had previous discussions about rules and boundaries with guests etc. And I try to stick best to them. I had been under the assumption that 10pm was the cut off, and when I got home with my boyfriend and best friend tonight at 9pm with a plan to sit for 15 or so minutes to finish our conversation. 

My brother however messages me telling me off, and when I message back to him and explain that I was under the assumption I was fine he gets mad at me and starts turning aggressive. 

I then move my group outside and we sit and talk in the driveway as he continues to message and harass me. I get iriateted and start to message back aggressively. He starts being really insulting towards my guests; who must I mention were only with me because they were helping me shop for my brother's birthday present. The conversation eventually leads verbal when he locks me outside for being disrespectful to him. We get into an argument over it, and he tells me off, and says some really offensive things to me. Before proceeding to tell Me how much he hates my life decisions (being queer), how stupid he thinks I am (I'm autistic), and how much I always step on his toes. I told him if he's not happy to pack his bags and move out before storming off into my bedroom. 

He's now blocked me on all social media and is refusing to talk to me.

I (42M), work at a **Clinic** where I have to run tests on about 10 handmaids a day, checking if they have successfully conceived a baby. The majority of my patients leave disappointed without a baby. As you know, the handmaids must conceive a baby or they will be sent to the colonies. 

I recently had a patient come in by the name of Offred, she seemed to be having a bad day (most of them do). I proceeded to run my routine checkups, urine tests, hormonal tests, cancer smears, and blood tests. She was not pregnant. I was already under the impression that she wasn’t going to be pregnant as most of those old commanders are infertile. 

I decided to propose the idea of me impregnating her, and I could tell it made her uncomfortable. She told me it was too dangerous and that she couldn’t. Was what I did wrong?

I texted her asking if anything was wrong because she normally texts me every 5 minutes, and she said that everything was okay and that it’s dumb and unnecessary to ask. I apologized and later that day she texted me a really long text saying that she thinks she’s too young and doesn’t feel ready yet to have a bf. I didn’t think much of it but then I remembered that she told me that she wanted to be in a relationship and wouldn’t break up for not feeling ready. I asked her about it and she started to call me a son of a b*tch because I asked her. She didn’t even answer the question and just kept insulting me all the time until I stopped texting her. The next day I asked once again and even said it’s okay when she doesn’t want to tell me the reason. She started insulting my whole family and that’s when I had enough. I didn’t say really bad things I just said „shut up and answer my question“ or „why tf are you insulting my family, I never said anything about yours“. She said I couldn’t get over her, which I did, and then she told me to stop creating fake instagram accounts to keep chatting with her. Which was stupid because she never gave me her name on instagram. She gave me this guys account and I told him to stop impersonating me (because he did) and he blocked me and her. I later told her that I am over her and never want to see her again or ever hear from her again. I blocked her everywhere and now she’s giving my phone number to her friends so that they can insult me and tell me I can’t get over her because I’m a simping bastard.

i (16F) was friends with cole (16M) for all of elementary, middle, and a part of highschool. it was an off and on friendship for almost it’s entirety. it was actually a trio friendship that included lexi (16F). cole would bounce his affections back and forth from me to lexi. 

at 13, we had group sleepovers at lexi’s house. one weekend he would entirety ignore me and give lexi all of his attention and push her away in order to make sure he also got all of hers, and then would do the same thing with me towards her. it was extremely toxic and destroyed parts of my self confidence.

we both had crushes on him, and he used that to his advantage. he acted like he was dating one of us at certain times. he would cuddle us, kiss our faces, hold our hands, but then other times wanted nothing to do with me or her, and switch to the other one. this was the extent of it until he started SAing me.

during sleepovers, he made me and lexi sleep on either side of him. this was fine up until i turned 14. he began taking his pants off in the middle of the night and grinding against my, what he thought was unconscious, body. i was awake everytime, at least i think i was. i cut cole off. about a year later so did lexi. as far as i am aware, he never did that to her, but he did do some really weird things.

sometimes i would go to his house alone. this is because he would NOT let lexi go with us. he would make me play dirty truth or dare with him. if i didnt play, he would make me go home. at the time my parents were having a messy divorce. so i played with him. he made me take my clothes off, made me kiss him, made me sit on his lap with no clothes, and even made me give him a handjob. i did it all, which is partially my fault, i could have said no. it was all just terrible.

fast forward to now. lexi met braydon, who was cole’s replacement for me (he tried to make a new trio with lexi and braydon). he is so good to lexi. once lexi and braydon FINALLY started dating for real, cole met april.

april moved here last year after all of the shit between him and i went down. she doesn’t know any of it, and i kept it as quiet as possible. he tells people he got to third base with me, i said i saw his dick and it was small (we never got to third base and i never saw his dick). cole is using april to rebound, and im seeing him do lots of things he did to lexi and i, to her.

he jabs her sides, squeezes her legs really hard, pushes her, leans into her, takes food from her, takes drinks from her, and expects her to give him her everything. she does it with no questions asked. she laughs when he hurt her. i see so much of myself in this situation, and it’s been going around school that her ex apparently took her virginity and then left her. she says its true. i know she is already very hurt. should i tell her everything? i feel like at this point i should stop worrying so much about what he does.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4818090,public,top,self,AITA if i warn my ex-bestfriend’s “girlfriend” about him?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2pqik/aita_if_i_warn_my_exbestfriends_girlfriend_about/,all_ads,6,,,,

At home, she would tell lies, she was disrespectful, she would go into her mother’s makeup and wardrobe, and at one point all of her friends had phones and she didn’t so she went on Amazon and tried to get herself one. We didn’t know if she knew our debit card was linked to the Amazon account she was logged into or not but regardless, we punished her for it. I punished my kids the same way. If they got in trouble, I hit them a few times with a belt and afterwards I would explain that I did it because I loved them. When she was 12, she didn’t get in trouble at school often [she still would, just not as regularly] and her grades were pretty average mostly C’s. This was a new school that she had started like a month or two away from summer so she was in 7th grade at this time. She would skip school a lot and was punished when we found out. She was bullied a lot [not why she skipped] and it continued for the next two years until we moved again. In 8th grade, she got in trouble for rating the male teacher’s appearances in a class with her friend and for using profanity. In that same grade, she became friends with a girl who had anxiety and then she had anxiety. At one point, her teacher took the paper she was writing on and my daughter was talking about how she hated me. She ended up being taken out of school and wasn’t allowed to come back until she had a therapist that said she wasn’t going to be a danger. She had to get a psych eval before she started therapy and it turned out she had moderate depression, generalized anxiety disorder, oppositional defiance disorder, and OCD. We also found out that her IQ was above average which made sense because she was really smart, she just didn’t apply herself.

We're in the UK. We have tea most nights at about 5:30pm, then generally - if we're not doing  anything more important - sit down in the living room to either A) play computer games or B) watch something on a streaming service.

In recent years, I've been falling asleep in front of the TV - both when I'm playing a game, or if she's playing a game, or if we're watching a TV show. The vast majority of the time, the TV show is something I really want to watch (she saves them so we can watch them together), but  I fall asleep regardless *most* nights, usually quite early on (8pm has been the earliest, but usually  it's around 9:30 - 10pm). This is especially true if we're watching a  show. Games keep me up a bit longer, but I often find myself running into walls / off cliffs / into danger in the game I'm playing as I'm dozing, which I usually find a bit funny.

The thing is, the wife gets quite upset by this. She gets frustrated, and has expressed that ""it's a waste of time"" watching TV with me, and that she's missing out on the shows I say I want to watch, because we get so little time to watch TV together before I'm asleep.

For context, before I met my wife I never watched TV; I'd watch DVDs (before streaming was a big thing!), but I always found forced programming somewhat of a waste of time. Also, I am a morning person, and she's more of a night owl (though she's changed her sleeping habits to be in line with mine, even though she has always struggled to sleep). In fact, I'd say I am a *very* morning person at the moment; I used to need 8+ hours of sleep, but  these days I'm lucky if I get 6 before waking up and not being able to  go back to sleep... so, if I'm in bed at 10pm, I'm up, bright-eyed and bushy tailed, at 4-5am. I don't have narcolepsy, or insomnia (other than  the occasional, expected bout when something is stressing me out) and generally sleep very well.

My phone slipped from my hand as soon as I read the message. I fell to the ground and started sobbing, trying not to throw up.

Sorry for grammar. 
For context, I(25) have been bffs with Kim(24) most of my life. I am always on K side bc I dnt want her to feel abandoned. She has high standard for everyone but herself. For ex. she becomes very hurt if she thinks somebody is rude to her, and expects them to get on hands and knees apologizing. But she is outright rude to her friends, and refuses to see her wrong in it.

A “new” friend, Amelia(22) entered our group around 4 yrs ago. Everyone loves her. She’s very kind and has never caused any trouble in the group.
For the last few months, I noticed K being unnecessarily rude to Amelia. everybody has noticed it ESPECIALLY A. For ex., K was hanging out with someone”Y” (who she previously claimed to hate) that had done horrible and cruel things to A. we (Kim included) had to BEG A to cut this person off. 
We all understood (girl code) that we don’t talk to or hang with ppl who have hurt others in the group. Well kim spent hours with this Y,apparently K felt she was doing the “right thing” because she then called A and told her all about it. A told K she was extremely uncomfortable with K spending personal time with Y, and felt slightly betrayed. A made it known that she would get over it, but needed some space so she could deal with her feelings alone. We didn’t see A for 2 months. 
Just one week later, we all hung out again. A  told 3 people in our group something personal. The people she told were those she felt closest to. Me, K and S. She told us all separately, and honestly I didn’t even know that the others knew about it. Until we we’re all hanging out in my living room, and another friend G brought it up in front of everyone. I asked where she heard that from… you guessed it, K told her. A was extremely hurt that K would share something so personal. And when we confronted her, she claimed she thought it wasn’t that big of a deal since all of us were friends. 
Last week was K’s bday, we went out of our way to do something nice, we all pitched in on gifts and went out for a good night . She seemed less than grateful. Later that night she was quite rude to each of us. And when I tried to bring it up the next day, she shut me down n went silent, saying she didn’t want to hear about what she did when she was drunk. More has happened but too much to write.
For the last week me and A have been spending a lot of time alone, A’s  feelings have been very hurt by the way K treating  her, and honestly I just don’t like to see ppl being mean to others.
We see no good solution.  Another friend in the Group thinks we are being too harsh on K by not inviting her to hangout and that K is beginning to notice Us being weird. We both live K so much. She is like a sister to me. But K is not somebody who can hear her wrongs. She will feel that we are hanging up on her. And it will be a fight.

My dad (49M) and his soon to be wife (49F) are getting married in a couple of weeks. I’m not very fond of her but as long as my dad is happy, I’m happy. I play nice when she is around and never start any arguments.
Their wedding will be in their house but I don’t know any details outside of that. My dad and I have always been close, but I recently moved for school so we don’t talk as much.

I (20F) was recently asked to be.. the ring bearer. The ring bearer? I mean I’ve heard of a flower granny and one of the grooms friends being “ring security” but I’m his DAUGHTER. I don’t have any siblings so it’s not like spots were already filled by them. Not to mention I feel like it’s almost insulting.. I would gladly walk down the aisle and throw flowers but when I asked if that’s what he meant he said no just the ring bearer. I said yes to the job because I’m a people pleaser and just want to make him happy.
