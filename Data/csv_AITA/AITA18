Wife had some friends in town this weekend. After everyone says goodbyes and exchanges hugs and handshakes, wife had to go out of town w/ daughter. She calls me along the way and mentions how there were things I said that made her feel like I was purposely dogging her. Her friends were talking about cars and which one a friend should get next. I happened to be quite interested in cars. I was explaining things to look out for that I would avoid and I started explaining what they were so they could understand. I’ll admit I’m a bit long winded and my mind can wander around stories so as I’m talking my wife interjects and asks me what I’m talking about in order to wrap me up. I then explain no that’s not what I’m talking about and she was confused. Another topic comes up and I did correct her but only because she was referring to my sisters divorce and how she got a new car out of it but she was making it seem like my sister was dumb because she had forgone alimony and just wanted a car. I did correct her. She was upset and claiming that I was doing this to make her feel small and to belittle her. I meant absolutely nothing by any of what I said. It’s possible that I can’t read social situations that well but I had no intention of putting her down rather I was trying to explain. 

Back to the call she starts getting mad and tells me all about how everything I do annoys her and how I do things the wrong way. And how I always have to work during weekends because I can’t manage time (she’s wrong about this btw). When we argue, she tends to use this phrase about how I try to “play the victim” whenever I explain myself. I told her she’s not to do that again. Since I drew said boundary, it’s been radio silence all day.

There's a park in my neighborhood we all visited even before I moved out, thus why they stopped by a nearby store I happened to also be at the same time. 

Background: I was raised vegan since 3 and secretly changed my mind around 24 for health reasons. I moved out a few months ago in large part to change my diet, because naturally, they forbid animal foods from being eaten in their house. I think they would have even disagreed with me eating meat/dairy period, whether I ate it at home or not---that's how strongly they feel about it.

I've been keeping it a secret for a while now, but it was always my intention to tell them. I even made a  *Why I'm No Longer Vegan* document detailing all my reasons why I switched to give them when I'd tell them, just to explain my new viewpoint on things. 

Back to today, I was in the store exchanging a bad pack of ground bison for a new one, and I came out and we saw each other in the parking lot. I talked to them for a bit and declined to go back in the store with them, because I didn't want them to see what I was returning.

The store was also super slow this evening, with one cashier and barely anyone else in the store, so it was very likely when we'd all go to the checkout line together, the cashier would of course recognize me, meet my family, and tell them what I just returned as small talk, since it ended up taking a super long time with their new computer system and whatnot.

Even though I didn't go back inside with them, that's what ended up happening anyway. When I got back home, I got a phone call from my dad telling me he asked the cashier if he just saw their daughter, she said yes and asked if we were family (we all look the same), and small talk ensued and the cashier told them the return story and what I was returning. 

My dad asked, ""Why didn't you tell us you were eating meat?"" I said I always intended to tell them myself, not to find out accidentally, and a long line of accusation started about me being a liar, sneak and a murderer.

She hasn’t missed a payment and I trust her to pay me back. However, through this gut wrenching break up we always argue via text when I specifically mention to call me to talk in person  instead or leave voice notes which she neglects to do. 

When I agreed on lending her the money I didn’t account on the scenario that we would break up in smite.

I suggested she find a credit union to take out a loan to pay me back in full and build some credit , as she has never had a credit card nor use the first one I insisted she applied for.

I've been in my location (leasing position) for 6 months now, but with the company for going on 2 years. My coworkers birthday is mid December. I had planned on celebrating Christmas with my family from out of state the weekend of 12/17, as we can't celebrate on the actual holiday due to families having to work on Christmas Day/weekend. 

On 11/10, my co worker received a job offer at a new company and her last day was going to be 12/9. So, on 11/17, I submitted PTO time from 12/16-12/19, knowing I was going to be working the 2 Saturdays prior, (3rd &amp; 10th) as we are the only 2 office staff who work weekends. If I was working the 3rd and the 10th, I sure as hell wasn't working the 17th as well. 

Here's where it gets tricky. When my coworker tried to turn in her notice a few days ago, my current company counter offered and she accepted a higher position in our office and is staying. My PTO time had been approved before she ever gave notice. So when we were going over the December calendar, she asked me ""you're working the 17th so I can have my birthday weekend off right?"" 
And I told her ""No. I'm taking that time off to celebrate Christmas with my family.""

She got SUPER mad and upset and asked why I did that, knowing it was her birthday and asked me to change my PTO time to accommodate for her. I told her ""Absolutely not. You weren't even going to be working here at that time and I needed to have at least one weekend off to spend the holidays with my family."" Not to mention, she has the entire week of Christmas off (21st-28th) to spend time with hers. 

She did not like this answer and is bringing it up to management next week. Am I overthinking it that she may try to use her new position (as someone I'm now supposed to ""report to"") against me?

Because I was feeling a little under the weather, I ordered egg drop soup for the table. When our food came, one of the people at the table said “Wait, so this is that weird bird’s nest soup right?” to which I immediately said “No. It’s egg drop soup”. My mother then jumped in and said “Haha yeah that bird’s nest soup is interesting to say the least” in a condescending tone. She then asked the waitress “do you also have shark fin soup here or no?”. To add on to this, when the waitress later brought out the rice, another person at the table said “Oh yeah. This is how these Korean people serve rice. It’s like my k-dramas” when we were clearly at a Chinese restaurant.

As we continued to eat, my family’s behavior got worse. They were blasting music on their phones for the whole restaurant to hear, yelling to other customers “OMG. I had way too many Modelos last night WOOO”, rudely asked the waitress “So, what tell me what free item are you giving the birthday girl. You need to give something”, and made comments out loud for the staff to hear about wanting to cook in the kitchen and teach them a few tricks. One person even gasped, yelled dramatically, and made a scene as if she was going to die simply for dropping her chopsticks.

I could clearly see that the waitress was getting uncomfortable as a new waitress had come to help us instead, and I was livid with my family at this point. I decided to bring it up to my family and said that they were acting like entitled kids”. My mother berated me saying “I’m being too much and too dramatic today”. I responded that they were being racist by asking stupid questions and making terrible comments. I followed up and said, “imagine if we were working in a Filipino restaurant (as we are Filipino) and someone asked us ‘You have dog or balut on the menu right?’ or someone assuming all Black-owned restaurants only served fried chicken and watermelon.

Now for the explanation, We are in a friend group that contains 7 other people. There’s this guy in the group D (22m) he’s a nice guy and is kind of attractive I guess. The whole thing happened yesterday when we were all at his sisters house J (20f). So we were all talking and I made a joke (wasn’t that loud) and she heard and repeated it louder tho and everyone laughed not a problem. We started talking about other things and our past and the only things she would talk about was just embarrassing things of me, Like in 7th grade when I tripped during a soccer game and other things that would make me embarrassed or just things I would trust her with. It wasn’t even funny things either and she would constantly laugh for like 5 minutes over some random thing or just laugh so loud. Also for the rest of the night she would just call me unfunny or just find any way to insult me and look good in front of D. So I was getting annoyed of her constantly saying things about me but my last straw was when she brought up when I didn’t get accepted to CU and called me stupid. I was embarrassed and upset so I told her to shut the fuck up because she couldn’t even get into a college and to stop acting like a pick me trying to look good in front of D because it was pathetic. She got mad and said it was just a joke, So I said “A joke? my ass. You keep putting me down to seem funny. It’s stupid. Sorry I don’t get your humor.” She gave me a dirty look and grabbed her things. J and 2 other people in our group said I shouldn’t have said that. But honestly who wouldn’t? She was putting me down to look good. She has since been posting things about how people you know are fake and how they can change through the blink of an eye, Which I find hilarious. But I’m also wondering if maybe choosing the way I spoke to her was a bit messed up.

When the hostess turned around she said ""YAY *little boy* you won!"" Naturally my daughter began to get very upset. Shes not a sore loser and was mad that the kid cheated.

All the other parents began saying ""Oh Allie its ok we cant always win."" or ""Maybe youll win at a different game.""

I was calming down my daughter and when I heard the other parents i said, "" You guys I do not want my daughter dubbed as a sore loser. He sat down in the chair and would not move. He cheated.""

They all stared at me shocked I would call out a 5 yr old for cheating.

My daughter had to use the restroom and we sat down on the couch together afterwards. The little boy came in and said something like ""we cant always win!""

I said ""you didnt move from the chair.""

I said ""You need to say sorry to Allie.""

We have two dogs, two lizards, a bunny, and a cat. I take care of my cat, but the rest of the animals are ""family pets"". 

All of my family struggles with different types of mental illness, but specifically my mom has issues with hoarding and PTSD from when she was a kid. As a result, she wasn't the best mom growing up and either completely neglected us or would do crazy things like buy us pets, toys, clothes, etc. It was a constant cycle of all or nothing. The house that my family lives in is unsuitable for most living things as a result: not a lot of room to walk around, smells of dog pee, a lot of trash and pests everywhere.

When I was 13, my mom got me a lab puppy, Charcoal. She promised we would train it to be a service dog, but she ended up giving up after a few months. I tried to train him alone, I took him on walks everyday, everything was going mostly good. Unfortunately, I ended up going to live in a hospital for a while and after I came back he was pretty much impossible. No one had continued his training and he hadn't been socialized with other dogs or gotten enough activity (both parents work full-time demanding jobs). I stopped being able to take him on walks because he would be aggressive (towards other people, dogs, etc.) and then I would have panic attacks. He continued to become more and more hyperactive and uncontrollable (stealing my food while I was eating, getting mud on my few precious clean items, barking very very very loud), and so I decided to put a gate on my bedroom door when I was 15/16 to prevent him from entering my room. I don't spend time around Charcoal because I don't know how to handle him. I feel a lot of guilt because I can't take care of him and no one is really taking care of him. He is not a bad dog by any stretch, just hyperactive, untrained, and needing more than what my family can give.

I've tried to ask my parents to look for a new owner for Charcoal because we can't take care of him, but they are really resistant to it. I feel like its wrong to have him cooped up in a cage and unloved. My parents can barely take care of themselves, much less the zoo that we have in the house. But, I also know that it's wrong to adopt a pet and then send it ""away"". If I had known at 13 that we couldn't take care of him, I never would have adopted him.

I (15F) live mostly with my mom (40F) and my sister (12F), but go to my dad’s every other weekend and on certain holidays.

After their divorce, he’s gotten better, but obv he didn’t get custody back much. 

My mom has a bf (60M) who lives very very far away. Their relationship is sh1tty and it’s obvious to everyone. Constant loud arguments via FT, which last up to 6 hrs. My mom locks herself away and yells, and ignores us every time. 
Last night, they were particularly heated and she threw something in her room. It woke up my sis. I was p1ssed and told her she was scaring us. She starts losing it, and saying that if our dad (always the excuse) would just take us more often she wouldn’t do this around us. Cursing at me ensued. Eventually I closed the door and left. I cVt myself for the first time in a panic attack and I hate myself for it.
She’s been treating me like a ghost since. I just want to get away for a bit. I’m afraid if I ask though, she’ll cry and scream and it’ll be my fault. I hate her bf so much. I wish they would just break up for real. 6 f-ing years of this is making me crazy.

Anyways, I am dog sitting for my mom atm. This is something I do semi-frequently because my mom likes to go out of town pretty often to visit her friend up north or visit the side of her family she likes. 

I agreed to dog sit for her, and have been since Friday (it’s Sunday). I would say I’m a pretty good dog sitter. I play with her dog whom I love very much and would absolutely steal if my mom became less attached. I take her on walks, give her probably more treats than she deserves, and clean up after her since my mom never potty trained her. That last detail is important (to me at least).

I recently got home from college and haven’t been working much but that picked up a bit over this weekend. I was gone yesterday from 7:30am to about 6pm. Today I work ten hours and won’t be home until 7pm or later because my job is a decent distance from my moms home. I didn’t think this was vital to tell my mom but she was not pleased to learn her dog was left along for such a long time.

I can get that 12 hours can be very long but I do not consider this an issue with her dog. Why? Well, because her dog has free roam of the house, has direct supply to food and water that won’t run out, and, most importantly, goes potty inside the house anyways so why tf does it matter???? 

My mom is saying I am the ahole because her dog is being left alone for so long. If the dog was in a crate for that long, I would understand but the dog has everything she could want and does not have separation anxiety like some of the other dogs I watch. Plus I

In August I (18F) moved away from my home country to study abroad on a gap year. Although it was hard at times I managed to make friends and have a decent friend group now. The guy who I consider my closest friend is S (19M). Since we live with about 100 students on campus there's a lot of drama and as such S and I bonded over gossiping about said drama.

Now there's another guy at our school O (18M). S expressed his interest towards him and not knowing if O was bisexual too I supported his crush but warned him. Through another friend I later found out that O was bi too... and so I excitedly told S because I was excited for him.

A little backstory on O and I. On a drunk night out he confessed to me that he liked me and being drunk I said that I did too and we kissed. The next morning I realised our mistake and decided to ignore O for about a week to make clear to him that I clearly regretted it. Ever since I discovered I really really do not like O. (S knows about all this in detail btw)

Here's where the problems started: I proposed to a few of my friends to come with me to my home country for 3 days to celebrate my birthday. O just happened not to be there so he didn't buy any plane tickets, while the others did. Between that day and the day of the trip (about a month) things started developing between O and S. But while S was pretty into O, O never gave the same energy back and was even seen holding another girl's hand.

S asked me if O could go on the trip too and I was very hesitant about this. I told S that I didn't want O to come because I didn't like him and I had a bad feeling. This was partly also because I feared O still liked me, but I didn't tell S this. Nonetheless because I wanted S to be happy I told him that, if he really wanted O to come, he could invite him. The night S invited O to come they had a talk and decided to just stay best friends and S had told me he was ok with that decision.

Fast forward to a few days later: on the night of my birthday (on that trip) I got very very drunk. Like blackout drunk. Like had 314 of a bottle of vodka drunk and beers drunk. And at some point somehow O and I started kissing again: I want to make it very clear that I don't know who initiated it and so it could've been me. The next thing I remember I'm in a room with O and we're making out. Although I don't remember a lot from what happened in that room, I do remember saying ""this is ok but no sex, don't wanna have sex"" Next thing I remember is having his penis inside me and me immediately excusing myself and leaving the room.

Outside I was met with a very angry S and we had a heated conversation that I almost don't remember anything of in detail. Afterwards I woke another friend up who helped while I had multiple panic attacks over what happened in the room. The next morning S still seemed pissed off at me.

Later on when i get the message back i now knew it was my 'best friend' at the time. G (16f) and I where in a little arguement at the time. I leave it at that. A few weeks later my friend Kayla (15f) was going back to school after getting C0VID  19. so i decide to text her 'Hey Kayla hope you have fun back at school today' unknowingly i sent the message to Ellie. about 10minutes later i get a text back 'If you think this is a way to start a conversation it wont work' As i reply to the message with 'Oh sorry wrong person' she gos on about how i dont deserve any of my friends. After seeing those messages i say 'cant we just be friends again?' she goes 'with you? never' i then go on calling her a c u n t -not a good idea- 

So i continue with my day and get home to find my mum has screenshots of the chat.We compare and find she deleted all the bad bits she said of hers to make it look like i am the asshole. We then send back the real convo to her mum.

I was too much into my head  and only cared about myself this whole time (4 years) and hurt my  girlfriend (24F and way beyond mature and compassionate for her age) real bad by being so insensitive. I knew she loved me from  day one and I still led her on without committing myself to her or  letting her know that i didn't want it. Because, I was too selfish to  let go of her though I did not accept her love. All she ever asked me  was for a simple yes or no. And i couldn't do that and came up with  different answers each time. But yet, she stood by me and never once  quarreled with me. I once overheard her tell to her friend on the phone  that "" letting go is the easiest thing to do these days, but staying and  fighting for a relationship is what makes it worth fighting for and  that's the fight i choose"". And maybe that is why she stayed with me for  these many years inspite of however insensitive i was to her.

A  month back, she finally left me for good and has not been replying back  to me ever since or even answered my calls. It was of course because of  what I did ( I was being too lethargic by not replying back to her or  be it me leaving to my home country without letting her know until i was  on a plane..i know..im a total asshole) Looking back at all this time i  had with her, makes me feel how shitty I have behaved with her or  treated her. I was too self centered while all she ever did was be  patient with me and loved and supported me. She has given me lots of  happiness (and im a stupid to realize all these only after she left).  She means so much to me now that i reflect back and i remember of how  much of a compassionate human being she was to everyone around her. She  does not have a single bad bone in her body and i yet failed to really  see her.

I do not know how to  rectify any of these since I have been so insensitive to her and towards  her feelings. I was happy as long as i got what i needed from her. I  wish she had at least fought with me or quarreled with me. But she did  neither. Just stopped talking to me all together. I now understand that  relationships do not just break because a couple is fighting over  small/big things. That a relationship fails when someone is too tired to  fight for it. I badly wanna make things right with her and have her  besides me. I wanna go back and talk to her and explain things. But I am  too scared to go fearing her rejection.

From  a guy who behaved too assholishly, GUYS, please take a moment to sit  and reflect on your relationships and please talk to your SO whether  they are happy. Don't be an asshole like me.

He's autistic. To give an idea of the severity, hes mentally around 15. He can go out by himself, has a job, can use public transport, goes to community college, can cook for himself, and do any basic function that a 15 year old could. I definitely have Glass Child Syndrome based on our relationship, and he sees me as an extention of my parents. He wants the perks of a parent (being able to drive him places, buy him stuff, help him when he needs it, care/do things for him) but will not give me the respect of one. I graduated university recently and he's been open that he hates having me around. He tells me point blank that he hates me, is mad at thatI'm living back at home, and hates how I now refuse to do things like I used to for him. I have rejected the half-ass parent role I was fullfilling. It was becoming stressful and I opened up to my parents about it. They said that now I'm making my own money and supporting myself, I do not have to be expected to fill in for them when needed.  Even with their support, he's gotten worse in the last few months. he started attempting to hit me and throws massive fits if I am talking to my parents and they don't stop in order to give their undivided attention to him. 

On to the present part. He's obsessed with getting stuff. During the holidays and his birthday, he will get aggressive and complain to anyone who does not give him money or an item during those times. He's never gotten anyone anything for those occasions. My parents will just pick out and buy something, then slap his name on the gift tag. As we've gotten older, hes showed interest in buying me things for these occasions. But in reality, he buys me something he would like and ends up stealing in the days after giving it to me. my parents see it and say its sweet that he's even considering me, even though they know I. Ever since I had the money to do so, I've always gotten him something for these occasions, and its always something that fits his list or his special interest. But for some reason, he decides that day when I give him the gift, hes no longer into the interest or that he hates it, and throws a fit, no matter if its actually something he wanted.. So I waste money trying to please someone who I will never be able to.

I talked to my therapist about this, and she advised me based on his hostility, my lack of parents interfering, and the prectiable outcome, I would be showing him its ok to act this way towards me because I will always get him something anyways. The problem is, my mom is hinting already on what I should buy him, and I haven't been honest about the fact that I will not be getting him anything. She keeps saying that I'm going to 'love' what he's getting me this year (she always says that even though she knows its just something he's going to end up stealing from me).

Most of these get-togethers involve mutual friends and family.

I have never particularly liked her husband. He enjoys being a contrarian, pushing people's buttons, and generally being mean-spirited. However, for the sake of my sister I put up with his shenanigans and try to feign a good relationship with him.

He has been rude to me in the past, insulted my partner multiple times, kicked me and my sister's friends out of his (and my sister's) house twice (while my sister sat in silence), and is CLEARLY not someone who makes a compatible friend with me.

He constantly makes comments about a specific insensitive topic even though I have verbally expressed that I am not okay with them and that they make me uncomfortable. He doesn't know that I have personally dealt with that insensitive topic in the past, and that what he says is personally triggering. But I don't think I should have to relive my trauma and explain that to him for him to stop saying insensitive things.

Anyhow, what drives me crazy is that whenever I see my sister, including every single time we visit our family and friends, he insists on tagging along. In order to see her without him being present, I have to conspire with friends and family to make plans on days where he is unavailable (which is sadly not that often).

My sister is completely ignorant, but she has lost multiple friends and familial relationships because people couldn't bare to be around this man. She thinks they either drifted apart or were bad people to her and her husband. I know from having spoken to these people that they couldn't stand being around this guy, and that he was the sole reason they decided to end the friendship.

She told my sister, devastated and crying, and supposedly all my sister had to say was that ""that was just his sense of humour"". Because of this, our friend moved cities and has been 'working or unavailable' whenever my sister's husband ended up in her vicinity.

However, contrary to what you may think, my sister is probably the nicest person I know. I cannot for a second understand how she could dismiss her friend's feelings like that. It is entirely out of character for her, and I was devastated to hear that that was her reaction to the situation.

I have had enough. The mere thought of this man disgusts me, and I want absolutely nothing to do with him.

But I love my sister, and I don't want to ruin her life.

Please note that she is happily married to him, and her life would be ruined if I told her my true feelings; if EVERYONE told her their true feelings.

She's always screaming at me about one thing or another. No matter what I do, it's never good enough and I get screamed at. My mom likes to claim that I do nothing and that I'm a lazy bum, when in reality, I work a full time job, do my fair share of chores around the house, and have been paying rent since I was 16. My mom however, lost her job when I was 16 and hasn't worked since. I've also never seen her do any chores but she might be doing some when im at work. When I'm at home she's either sitting and watching TV, or yelling at me for stuff I didn't do.

Yesterday she went out with her friends. The house was kind of a mess, and I had no plans so I started cleaning and doing some chores. By the time my mom got home I only had the kitchen left to do. She saw the dishes in the sink and shouted ""all I want to do is come home to a clean house!!!! Is that too much to ask?!!"" While slamming her purse on the table, knocking almost everything on it over. 

She screamed at me for not doing anything, like normal. It pissed me off because I work a full time job, pay rent and do my share around the house, but my mom doesn't work and, from what I see, doesn't do anything around the house. I knew I couldn't do anything. No matter how much rent I pay, or how many chores I do, she's still going to scream at me. I sighed and went to my room. I guess that pissed her off even more because she screamed ""I WANT YOU OUT BY THE END OF THE MONTH!!!!!"" I just shut and locked my door. 

My dads still in the picture, but his wife and stepkids take up 99% of his time. I'm not really close with the rest of my family. The only person I felt I could ask was my cousin(25f). So I asked her if I could stay with her for a while until I could get on my own place and she thankfully agreed. 

I packed my stuff and went to sleep. This morning I made my bed and cleaned my room for the last time before leaving. I got to my cousins house, thanked her again, and settled in. We talked for a bit before I got a call from my stepdad. He asked if I'd be coming home. I told him I wouldn't because of my mom. He said he understood then hung up.

A little while later, my phone blew up from messenges from my mom and some of her friends. Apparently, me leaving caused an argument between my mom and stepdad. Since my stepdad and I were the once paying rent, me leaving meant that my mom had to get a job or they'd lose the house. I guess my mom didn't like that idea because she's staying at her friends house and my stepdad is house hunting 

Her friends are calling me a giant asshole because my moving out destroyed her relationship with my stepdad and is causing her to be almost homeless. My cousin thinks I'm right to move out. But I still feel myself wondering if I am an asshole or not.

A few days ago, he was in a meeting so he didn’t come out of his office at 12 for lunch. I asked my son if he was hungry but he said he wasn’t and he wanted to wait for his dad. My husband’s meeting finished at 2 and I went to see if he wanted lunch but he told me he was busy. I asked him if he could take a 20 minute break because our son was waiting for him so they could have lunch together.

He did come but he was angry at me for not feeding him at 12 like I normally do. He only got more upset because our son told him he was hungry when he saw him. Even though I explained our son chose to wait for him, he’s still upset and it felt like he was telling me off for letting a 3 year-old make that decision.

It was fine and fun. This year we wanted to do it again, but I wanted to invite more people, my girlfriend doesn't have a lot of friends here since she moved here for college during the pandemic and had a falling out with her closest friend not so long ago. I told her if she wanted to invite anyone and said she didn't have anyone she'd want to invite. For some context I have a female friend who I'm really close with, she's like a sister to me I don't feel anything romantic or sexual for her. But since she's attractive and likes to como to the city I live in a lot my girlfriend hates her and gets anxiety attacks whenever my friend visits. My other friend who I had invited, invited my female friend from before to Thanksgiving. Which I didn't want to do since I didn't want my girlfriend to be uncomfortable. But since it was already done, I asked my girlfriend if thats okay
She then proceeded to scream at me and say I was inviting to many people and that were not gonna be able to cook for that many people and that I wasn't leaving any place for her friends (which she said she didn't wanna invite in the first place) we have been discussing for weeks because after our initial discussion I decided that I'd like to cancel the whole thing since I feel bad about telling my friend she's not invited any more. No she's blaming me and saying I'm a quitter and that it's my fault that Thanksgiving is cancelled, since I preferred to cancel everything rather that specifically tell someone she's not invited cause my girlfriend is really anxious about her existence. 

PS: no I don't have any feelings for my female friend, I really do think you can have friends from any gender. My girlfriend just gets crazy about this specific friend because of a ""gut feeling""

And it has been resolved by my mother recently. But I’m just curious.

I (nb 19) have been missing certain clothing items super recently. My room is in a bit of a disorganized jumble, since it is being painted and shifted around. But I kept all my ‘good’ (professional, formal, especially cute, etc.) clothes on the shelf in my walk-in closet.
Now, I had been living in my living room for 3 months, to the chagrin of my mother. I recently moved back into my room and started organizing it. I started a new job that requires more office casual wear, and all of my nice clothes seem to be missing. To preface this, I have no problem with my sister “Cat” (f 15) ‘borrowing’ my clothes, as in I don’t make a big deal out of this. But when I asked her about the clothes she claimed she knew nothing about it and to check our other sister’s “Vee” (f 11) closet. I had my doubts, but I checked anyway (with her permission). Nothing. Then my mom suggested that perhaps I washed them unknowingly and lost them in the laundry. Fair fair. Then, I saw Cat getting on the bus wearing one of my missing blouse. I just sort of lost it, I’ll admit. I went into her room and searched through her closet and found not one, but 4 of my nicer clothes. 2 blouses and 2 cardigans

I WAS planning on just putting them in my room and not mentioning the subject. But, Vee was home sick and caught me searching. She told Cat and Cat blew up at me. And for good reason, I wouldn’t be too happy if she had invaded my room like that. And she told mom, again I don’t blame her. I defended myself by saying that she blatantly lied to me when she told me she had no idea where my clothes went.

I apologized to her for searching through her closet, and mom made her apologize to me for lying. She’s still convinced that she did nothing wrong and that I’m an AH for what I did. It’s over with at this point, so I don’t care. And I still haven’t found the rest of my clothes so I just went out and bought new ones.

I just wanted to say that before I explained what happened.

I (15m) was in a party with a few friends, including a guy I'll call Jack(15m). The other people in the party were away at the time so it was just us talking, when he brought up his dog, who is dead (I don't remember the context). 

This made me reminiscent of my dog (also dead) and I make that 'hmmmp' sound when you are deep in thought. My friend said ""are you laughing"" to which I, a bit shocked say ""no I'm just thinking about my dog, since you were talking about yours."" I try to explain to Jack that I didn't laugh, but he was convinced that I did, shouting at me saying things like ""I hope one of your family members dies"" and (after reminding him I was thinking about my dead dog ""good you deserve it""

This Is when one of our friend comes back, in time to hear me call him a prick and leave the party. After I left I wrote down what he said in case he tried to lie about the situation before (another friend had an issue with him being dishonest). The day after, I found out he had blocked me on everything and ignores me in person. I've tried explaining my side of the story, but he won't talk to me, and my friends are taking his side.

As far as I'm concerned I'm definitely TA (at the very least from his perspective), but I don't care about that. I just want to know how to get a friend back. I'm autistic and struggle with making and keeping friends, I just want to find a way to pit this behind us.

Not even a month after the wedding, me and my Nephew (both 18 at the time) saw Wife and nephews friend (20 M) on the porch of my mother's house smoking and soon after they started kissing. Keep in mind friend lives at mothers place and bother moved back in with Wife right after the wedding. When I was dropping off nephew and we saw what they did it was really hard to hold back our rage. A few days later Nephew and Niece were talking about it and Niece decided to tell brother. Brother didn't believe anything she said so nephew decided to tell him about what we both saw and how touchy/weird she's been with Nephew. Brother didn't believe him either and they got into fight that ended up with Nephew being kicked out at midnight. I heard about the fight the very next morning and went to where Nephew stayed for the night to check in on him. After hearing the reason for him being kicked out I couldn't hold it in anymore. all through out our lives I've always been the blunt one who said things how it is, no sugar coating, just straight facts. I texted Brother everything, when it happened, where it happened, and all the creepy touchy things she tried with Nephew. Brother once again didn't believe it BUT this time he actually confronted Wife about it, Wife had a breakdown, denied everything, then texted everyone in MY family that she could and told them that I was crazy, manipulative, and even accused me of trying to ""keep Brother for myself"". Everyone that knew her before the wedding didn't really believe her but also don't care cuz in the end it's his choice to stay with her, but the family that believed her started messaging and texting me about how awful I am and how I need to stop trying to get attention... 
I never did this for attention, I never wanted to tell him like that but I did, I just wanted him to know so he wouldn't have to go through the same pain he did when his first 2 girlfriends(wife is his 3rd) cheated and I was the only one who cared enough to comfort him during those times. 
I get that I come off strong and it should be ""none of my business"" but if I got married and the person I married cheats on me not even a month after the wedding I would want to know.

Ever since I’ve tried it, it's literally been my favorite Pie. I can bake it really well too (I like baking). I mean Ree Drummon never fails and the entire experience makes me feel good about myself. 

Now, I haven’t baked the pie in 3 years because of my family. It’s not like their allergic at all, or we can’t afford the ingredients, or having two or three pies isn’t in the cards for my family ever. They just don’t like me baking the pie??? My mom doesn’t *love* pecan pie and neither does my sister (it’s not like they hate it, its just not their favorite), so we’ve been buying apple and pumpkin instead (no one really even loves the apple? So like what? They also end up being mid). My dad was MIA with this whole thing and usually does whatever my mom wants. So for the past three years, I’ve been told no when it comes to my Pie. 

Fast forward to like, 2 weeks ago and I overheard my sister and my mom talking about thanksgiving and me. Verbatim my sister says “Is OP going to bake his stupid Pecan Pie again” HELP? I HAVE NOT BAKED IT IN THREE YEARS. I like confronted my sister about this and she was like “No no no I meant like you always bake it” its been literal years…. 

Now today my dad comes back from thanksgiving shopping. He brings back Pecan Pie materials and says he’s going to make Pecan Pie. I’m just- why? Of course I get upset and of course my mom chooses now to just say “it’s whatever” to pecan pie and my dad’s dead set on baking it his own way.

Yes the easy compromise would be “just make it together”, but the way my dad is making it isn’t a hard way to do it (frozen crust) so its just throwing things in a mixing bowl and filling the crust - poof done. I use homemade crust and its a process, it literally helps me dewind especially from school by going through the process and letting it chill, and then being able to just have a nice pie in the end with the best crust ever - it's insanely rewarding especially when I do it on my own. Even if my dad was open to making the crust, he’s been dead set on doing it on his own and there’s really no way to change that man’s mind. 

I don’t know I feel like I’m overreacting about it and making a big deal out of PIE, but I genuinely feel like I’ve been steamrolled for years at this point in favor of whatever my family wants to do. Like I guess I should be grateful because I at least get to bake something with my friend for friendsgiving (apple pie made by scratch, a long process that's better when work is shared \[ we can’t do pecan because of nut allergies\]), but seriously it's like I’m purposefully being blocked from doing what I like to do (on top of it all, I’ve maybe baked thrice in the last two years because I’ve been so busy)

My coworkers birthday is mid December. I had planned on celebrating Christmas with my family from out of state the weekend of 12/17, as we can't celebrate on the actual holiday due to families having to work on Christmas Day/weekend. 

On 11/10, my co worker received a job offer at a new company and her last day was going to be 12/9. So, on 11/17, I submitted PTO time from 12/16-12/19, knowing I was going to be working the 2 Saturdays prior, (3rd &amp; 10th) as we are the only 2 office staff who work weekends. If I was working the 3rd and the 10th, I sure as hell wasn't working the 17th as well. 

Here's where it gets tricky. When my coworker tried to turn in her notice a few days ago, my current company counter offered and she accepted a higher position in our office and is staying. My PTO time had been approved before she ever gave notice. So when we were going over the December calendar, she asked me ""you're working the 17th so I can have my birthday weekend off right?"" 
And I told her ""No. I'm taking that time off to celebrate Christmas with my family.""

She got SUPER mad and upset and asked why I did that, knowing it was her birthday and asked me to change my PTO time to accommodate for her. I told her ""Absolutely not. You weren't even going to be working here at that time and I needed to have at least one weekend off to spend the holidays with my family."" Not to mention, she has the entire week of Christmas off (21st-28th) to spend time with hers. 

She did not like this answer and is bringing it up to management next week. Am I overthinking it that she may try to use her new position (as someone I'm now supposed to ""report to"") against me?

You don't have my permission to use this anywhere else.

So I am part of a group of friends. I'm in my early thirties and a woman. We've all known each other for varying amounts of time. Some people are closer than others. We get all together every month but obviously some people see each other more often. We normally go for drinks or dinner. 

One friend, Kelly (29F) I am not really close to. I normally see her as part of the big group. Kelly just had a baby about 7 months ago and seems to be struggling as her husband works long hours. She hasn't come out with all of us but I've still seen her once in a while. 

I've started to pull back a bit from my friendship with Kelly and a few others have as well. Any time we've gone over there (I live close to her and another friend), she sort of treats us like unpaid labor but says this is just part of being friends. When I'm there she'll ask one of us to hold the baby or do dishes or run a load of laundry. I have enough of all this to do on my own (minus the baby) so I kind of get a little pissed off going over to someone's house and doing chores every single time. I don't mind helping out but it's a little crazy. 

She asked to borrow something of mine yesterday and I went over to drop it off. While I was there she asked if I wouldn't mind mopping the kitchen for her. I told her I was in a hurry and she got a bit huffy. She told me that raising a child was hard and she needed ""her village"" to step up and help her. I kind of had enough and told her that I didn't want to be part of her village. This really set her off and I walked out the door and haven't spoken to her.

I started working from home when Covid started and now do so permanently. After moving in, Kelly, my girlfriend, decided she wanted a dog. I only had cats growing up because I’m allergic to dogs, and she always had dogs growing up.

I pushed off the purchase of the dog for as long as I could. Mainly citing my allergy and the time commitment it would take. Since she doesn’t WFH I would need to be the one walking, feeding, and cleaning up after it. Although I work from home I’m a project manager and am generally busy all day (and often nights).

After months of begging and promising she would make sure the hair wouldn’t be an issue I caved and agreed. 

We prepared our apartment, we bought an air purifier for each room and even got a Roomba which is able to get surface level hair, we also got a nice vacuum for deeper pet hair cleaning. These helped but it wasn’t enough so I started daily allergy relief medication.  These all seemed to help and Kelly was great at washing the sheets and cleaning the couch to get the hair up. 

After a few weeks she began to get lazy with the maintenance and my allergies kicked in like they did the first few nights. I’d lay in bed and hate my life because I could barely breathe in my own apartment. Upon mentioning this, Kelly, who is generally very caring and great, would be concerned and we’d spend the next night deep cleaning. But the laziness was cyclical. She would say she was going to have a routine and could keep at it for a week or two but then get lazy again.

This went on for several months. I started to get more and more annoyed by her disregard for our plan and how she only kept her promise when I reminded her. I mentioned we would have to give the dog back if she kept failing to keep the apartment clean enough for my allergies to not be debilitating and this worked for maybe two weeks but then it was the same thing again... Last week I was laying in bed and couldn’t fall asleep because she didn’t wash the sheets that weekend and it was hard to breath and I got frustrated so I walked outside for some fresh air. I came back inside and slept on the couch because that seemed better for me than the bed. The next day, I took the dog back without telling Kelly. 

Kelly was very upset by this. I will mention here that I took care of the dog during the day and she did at night, although it was “hers”, it was technically mine on paper since I bought it, and I was with him all day everyday, I love him liked I loved my cats growing up, I cried while bringing him back to the (no kill) shelter we got him from but I couldn’t take it anymore.

I (16M) and my mother (45F) have been odds at each other over this particular issue for as long as I can remember. So, my mother enjoys posting pictures of me and my sister (9F) on various social media platforms, including Instagram and Facebook. I have been vehemently against my mother doing this (without my consent), as I find it to be a serious breach of my privacy and do not want my likeness to be available online unless I (or someone I give consent to) puts it there.

I understand that my mother is legally sound, but I am in disbelief at how justified my mother feels in putting these pictures of me online. She believes that as my mother, she is legally and morally in the right in doing whatever she wishes in regards to me, including (but not limited to) taking pictures of me in any situation without my consent, posting such images on the internet, and (less relevant, but still important imo) touching me in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable (such as tickling). Whenever I prevent her from doing any of these things (by removing myself from the situation), she tries to guilt trip me and gets angry if I don't comply. If I get mad at her, she gets even angrier, and says that it's her right to do so as a parent.

Recently, the same kind of issue occurred once more. After 2-3 months of preparation, I scored a perfect score on the November 3rd SAT (1600) on my first attempt at taking it. I was immensely proud, and so was she, but then she posted an image of me on a social media site (I think Facebook, although I didn't see the logo) with the caption ""My 16-year old son \[name\] scored a perfect 1600 on the SAT on his first try."" The issue I had with her posting it wasn't the caption, but rather the image, which I only allowed her to take after she promised she wouldn't post it on any social media platform.

I personally don't care about getting validation for my own achievements from people that I have never known, so when she showed me her post (and everyone's comments under the post), I wasn't happy with her, as she expected I would be. Rather, I was quite mad at what I perceived to be a violation of my trust in her, as she not only decided to do what I told her made me feel uncomfortable, but also after she promised not to do so. I explained this to her and told her that she broke my trust yet again and that I was severely disappointed (although in harsher terms, as I began yelling, and really angrily at that; I didn't insult her though). She proceeded to get mad at me, shouting at me and going on the same spiel about how it's her right as a parent, stating that I have no online persona, that I will never be notable as a person, and that I'm not famous so I'm the AH for making a big deal out of nothing.

I pulled this lady over at the gate of my base for failure to display a front license plate, (In the state of California you’re required to have both front and back if you have California plates) and usually I just pull them over and just tell them that they have to display two license plates at all times in the state of california if you have california plates and let them go on their merry way. However, this lady (who isn’t in the military) the second I got to her window, not allowing me to tell her what vehicle violations she is committing, started yelling at me saying “My husband is a CWO-5 and I don’t deserve to be pulled over and treated like a criminal.” I told the lady that you have to calm down so I can explain what is wrong with her vehicle. After I explained it to her, she started rambling “I been here for 3 years and never once been pulled over for this BS, this is stupid.” I just simply tell her that we are trying to cut down on the vehicle violations on base so therefore I have to pull you over and explain what is wrong so that you can fix it. Than she goes on to belittle me because I am a Junior Enlisted. So I asked for her Military ID, Insurance, License and Form of registration. Everything comes back good besides her insurance which was expired by 2 months. So I got out my ticket book to write her a written warning for her insurance so she can get it fixed, but than I hear her saying “I have better things to do so can you hurry the fuck up?” Than I processed to look at her vehicle without talking to her looking for multiple violations on her vehicle. I cited her for: Failure to Display Front License plate, License plate cover, expired insurance, illegal front windshield tint, obstructed view, and Failure to stop at a stop sign (We have a stop sign at the gate and she didn’t stop at it for us to scan her ID but it is just a petty once to add on.)

Two years ago, she was the most perfect daughter with amazing grades and spent her time being productive. 

A year ago, she met a crew of people in town who have taken quite the toll on her mentally. She completely changed, became more aggressive, started changing her style, swears now and has gotten in trouble with the police at times for misdemeanours. 

Mid way through this year, I transferred her to a boarding school 25 miles away as I tried to take her to therapy which she kept on missing, i grounded her (she only sneaked out) and i also took her to rehab as i thought this may be a drug problem . I am sure the crew she hangs out with now do all kinds of uncanny things, they are all older as well (18-22). 

My daughter informed me that she hated me for sending her to boarding school jan 22’ to June 22’. She has told me that she wants to stay here so she could hang out with them and that what I am doing just makes her want to behaviour bad even more.

Me and her father have tried to take her out, took her to holidays, tried a psychiatrist and let her do as she please. None of these worked. 

The time I came to my decision of sending her back to this boarding school was when I was woken up by the police in the middle of the night, back at the end of October.

Clarifying that she had attempted to run away from the police after her friends were caught with drugs. They searched her and she didn’t have anything on her. She was detained for the night and let go by morning time. Some of her friends who had the possession of drugs were questioned and convicted with misdemeanours that their parents bailed out.

Me and my husband lectured her and told her that we are sending her to boarding school again. She cried profusely and caused a tantrum. Claiming that we were “ruining her life”.

We took her to the boarding school over a week ago.

Feeling bad for him, fiance gave him her CC information to pay the bill ($350).

We are not married but live together and have been discussing finances for awhile. While we are handling finances separately the plan is to eventually combine finances once married. Finances are often a heated topic as fiance is more cavalier with money/spending than myself. Discussions often lead to her saying 'well it's my money, so I can do what I want with it.'

Previously we had discussed certain financial boundaries. She has tendency to loan money to family members. My niece recently asked for $250 for rent. I loaned it to her after clearing it with fiance and indicated I'd appreciate it on her end as well.

She didn't discuss the loan to her brother with me beforehand as she was obviously pressed for time. However, she didn't tell me about it after the fact until she received an unknown charge from an airline in the amount of $650. She then brought both to my attention.

My immediate thought was to dispute the charge and contact her brother. She refuses to dispute the charge and reached out to him directly - he swears up and down it was a mistake (apparently he saved her CC info to her Apple wallet and accidentally used it while paying for a plane ticket). He also said he would pay her back once he deposited some money at the bank.

Prior to his passing, her Dad gave fiance's brother $10k for 'safe keeping' for fiance's future wedding. Once we were engaged, brother previously told fiance he'd get the money to her, then said he spent it all and didn't have it, then went back to saying he'd get it to her eventually. He also went through a financial hardship as his previous business partner sued him for fraud (fiance's brother was acquitted).

This all happened Friday. As of Sunday afternoon her brother is now radio silent.

For the most part, I kept my mouth shut about the $10k until fiance was griping to me about it while dealing with another problem regarding her brother. I told him we could always look into litigation if she wanted, but that would be her choice and I would not push the matter further. She shot that down and I never mentioned it again.

Now that he has stolen more money from her, I have voiced more concern as this may recur since she basically shrugs her shoulders and hopes he pays her back - ""money comes and goes."" She says she is going to cut him off after this, but he appears to have a certain sway over her as he has helped her out in the past.

This is a tough one for me. I do not want to overstep my bounds in this matter as fiance is telling me 'not your circus, not your monkeys.' However, once we are married it will turn from 'hers' and 'mine' to 'ours' - how do I tow the line between what's acceptable and what's egregious?

My boyfriend and I both have Christmas work parties. My work is doing it next month and  his work one is today. He's allowed a plus one and I would've loved to go with him but he told me he was taking his 6 year old kid with him and he wasn't allowed to take more people. He said the kids would be getting presents but every employee would get presents for their kids to take home so she wouldn't be missing out on gifts if she didn't go. I think he should've taken me instead especially because his daughter spends weekends with her mom so he had to ask her mom to take her for extra time. He said some of his other coworkers were taking their kids with them but I told him most would probably take their partners and he agreed. 

This is the first time ever that I'd be going at my work because Covid kinda made them not happen the past two years. So I'm not really sure how it's usually like. From what I understand he'd be going to a restaurant. 

Also for my work we're not allowed plus ones otherwise I'd have asked him to go with me.

Last week, we went over there for brunch mid-morning. The outdoor table was set with plates, etc. I had my layers on again, but I was cold.

This year, my house is hosting and as of now, there’s beef in the family.

 My ex aunt (35f) has done MANY things to make our family have divisions since she married my uncle (40m) about 5 years ago. She’s lied to her own son about who his father was for all 17 years of his life and painted her ex husband as a wild abuser while still inviting him to tons of family events and hugging on him and even doing things like flirting with him while married to my uncle. She’s cheated on my uncle MULTIPLE times over their marriage and even told my mom to fuck off when we were interested in a house in the neighborhood they were scoping out—which we didn’t know that it was them looking for the house. Through the years, she’s just said a lot of unnecessary and very rude things to different members and even elders in the family. About 3 months ago, she filed for divorce and wanted full custody over her and my uncles daughter (my cousin) with no visitation. My uncle is a very good and proud dad and my parents and I thought she was crazy for wanting conditions like that after SHE cheated and then proceeded to blame him. Unfortunately, my uncle is (I kind of don’t know another way to put this) a bit of a pushover and now she wants to get back together, and he agreed. At this point, my mom has expressed that she doesn’t want my ex aunt in the house whatsoever, but now comes in the Christmas eve party that we don’t want her there due to how much she’s damaged our family. there are other moms in the family who agree with my mom, but are too scared to voice their opinions. we want my uncle there since he’s a family OG and such, but his wife(?) will be there too.

Tl;dr: Partner comes to my house, leaves laptop bag on floor and clothes on my bed after I had spent a long time cleaning. Says I'm TA for getting upset and making a deal out of it. 

Don't want this to be too long so I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. 

Today my family is celebrating thanksgiving early while some family are still in town. I spent the last couple of days cleaning my room as it had gotten a bit cluttered and whatnot. My partner had spent the night and we played some games together (he used my laptop). Before the dinner he went back to his house to get cleaned up and left my laptop out so I put it back in my laptop bag because I don't like things being left out.

When he gets back a couple of hours later he was irked about the fact that I had put it away even though he was coming back. I explained that I don't like things out, and the bag is just on a hook behind my door - not exactly hard to get to or anything. So he took out the laptop and left the bag on the floor, which I picked up and put back. I had also noticed he put a bunch of clothes on my bed despite him having his own drawer in my dresser for his things. I was really ticked off about this and that began an argument. He said it's not a mess because I already had a mess on the bed. I argued that blankets on a bed are not a mess (even if they are not laid out flat) because blankets belong on a bed. My sister happened to come in and also agreed with me that the clothes he put made it a mess, and that blankets on a bed are not inherently a mess. I also kept arguing that it's generally just not a nice thing to do after I spent so much time cleaning.

After a while of us being ticked off at each other, he said that his drawer was full so he couldn't put his stuff away. I didn't understand why he couldn't have just said, ""Hey my drawer is full, where can I put these?"" Instead of just tossing his stuff. I would have gladly shown him a spot where he could put it. So I kept bringing up the point of how much time I spent cleaning and don't appreciate what he's doing. He says i'm TA for how I'm treating him.

I was raised by my grandparents because she was a teen mom in the 60s. I knew my whole life (I have no idea how I kept that secret as a child, except to say I was terrified my sister/mother would totally abandon me because I adored her and it was drilled into me to NEVER TELL A SOUL) my 4 sibs did not know I was their sister until they were adults.

Before COVID I went through a divorce and walked away from everything to escape abuse. I rented my own place and was at peace. My mother begged me to move in with her and my ""stepfather"" (sibs' father), both of whom were in ill health.

I moved in, took over the cooking and cleaning, shopping, etc. About two months in my stepfather became immobile and unable to get out of bed. I pretty much waited on him hand and foot. I didn't mind; he had always been good to me. This included diaper changes and personal care daily. He passed away about a year after I moved in. I have always worked at home but this did affect my income. I had to pull a lot of all nighters, as well as watching him at night because he would get very agitated. We moved him into a hospital bed in the living room and I slept on the couch next to him.

After his passing my mother understandably went through a depressive stage that lasted over a year and I literally did everything for her. She would refuse to eat. I spent a lot of time coaxing her to eat, making sure she was hydrated, taking her medicine, getting her in the shower, changing her bed when she was incontinent, etc.  About six months ago she popped out of her depression and started doing more for herself.

Now the AITA part. My 4 sibs have always complained I'm not paying rent, even though she begged me to live here. Now that she's feeling better, they have ramped that up. I hear the ""you're living there for free"" complaint often. I still buy all the groceries and household necessities, take her out to eat a couple times a week, to appointments, clean, laundry, etc.  She is prone to falls and has fallen three times since I've been here.  I pretty much take care of everything for her. 

This came up again recently.  I said if I have to pay rent I'll just get my own place.  My mother got upset and said she doesn't want to live alone and doesn't want to end up in a retirement home. The spouses of my sibs have said she's not moving in with them. She said she didn't want me to move out; one of my siblings said that I should start paying rent then. She stays quiet during the conversations about rent and doesn't defend me, just says ""Oh, ignore them,"" after they leave.

My mother is pretty well off financially. I would be contributing more if she needed it or was struggling financially. I am not well off but comfortable; I don't ""need"" to live here. My sibs had a will drawn up and I am not included. I was also not included in my grandparents' will who raised me. So this isn't about hoping to get an inheritance.

I (15F) left my ex boyfriend (15M) in March 2021, it was a really emotionally draining experience as this was my first relationship I've ever had. My ex's friends don't like me cuz of the way I look and ever since I broke up with my ex they have been treating me like absolute shit (including my ex). My ex called me names such as 'bitch' and all of the sudden he called me a 'pig woman'. Now, I take full responsibility that it was also my fault that our relationship died, I didn't like his friends because they were rlly shitty towards me and hence said really bad things abt them, that's the YTA on my part and I fully acknowledge that. 

So to the actual story, back then I had a really tough time moving on. Moreover, my ex and his friends are like popular in my class but are one of the biggest assholes to ever exist (example: A teacher came into our class during our recess to tell us to keep our voices down because the graduating batch in my school was taking their national exams but once the teacher left one of them said ""Don't care"")

I've been complaining abt how unfairly I've been treated in class. The popular boys will treat everyone like decent human beings while I'm getting treated like trash, but most of my friends back then all said ""Oh they just don't mean it"".  I didn't actually tell my parents abt this because I didn't want them to get roped into this mess so I had to take out my emotions via social media

I talked abt how unfairly I was being treated in school in my story and how surprised I was that people would befriend such assholes in my story on Instagram. I was actually really pissed abt this. Then someone came in and just twisted my words and then 'exposed' me to the entire class so I ended up losing all of my friends.

I'm not that great at apologizing with words but the best I could do was show to my classmates that I'm actually sorry by trying my best to make small conversations with them and try to reconcile with them.

Then fast forward to a couple of months, one of the mature boys in class sent me a screenshot of him sticking up for me and he acknowledged that I did put effort into trying to reconcile with everyone and that the assholes in my class should learn to open up and push their egos aside. And then technically that's when everything sorta died out.

Now 2022, I'm currently on good terms with everyone from last year and I've also made some new friends this year so I guess all's well ends well, I know this is a really messy AITA story because everything is sorta all over the place

Also I might delete this account because I'm not sure if anyone else in my class uses Reddit other than my friend who also uses this app but I know quite a number of people who uses tiktok and I'm always seeing those text-to-speech tiktoks and those AITA podcasts on tiktok and I'm genuinely scared that if this gets on tiktok I might get blacklisted again",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4810097,public,top,self,AITA for getting mad abt unfair treatment,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0h90z/aita_for_getting_mad_abt_unfair_treatment/,all_ads,6,,,

My wife and I (both mid 50s) usually host family dinner for Thanksgiving. We have some friends coming over this year also. We planned a menu, and I went out and got everything we needed. I took the turkey out of the freezer yesterday morning.

A few hours later, she was admitted to the hospital. She’s probably not going to be home by Thursday, so I might have to do all the prep and all the cooking by myself. I’ve done it once or twice, but it’s much easier with help, of course.

Our younger daughter asked me last night if I was still planning to have everyone over. I said of course. Now she and her husband (both late 20s) are treating me as if I committed some sort of crime against humanity.

My wife invited two of her friends who don’t really have anywhere else to go to celebrate, and we don’t want them to be alone. It’s going to be a little awkward without my wife there, but it’s going to be more awkward if I cancel plans with only a couple days’ notice.

I also don’t want the food to go to waste. It’s not really a big picture issue, but it is something that I need to consider. I love to eat, but none of this is exactly casual weeknight dining.

My wife is having a fit because I’m considering making dinner instead of spending the day with her at the hospital. Visiting hours are only noon to six and they only allow one visitor per day (not one at a time). So whoever shows up first prevents anyone else from visiting.

Our older daughter and her husband (both early 30s) have offered to help, but they don’t live with us and they don’t want to end up doing everything. My wife’s son (mid 30s) will show up to eat, but he could burn water. His idea of a fancy meal is adding raisins to his Cheerios.

We have a pretty long driveway and I want a snowblower to help clear the snow this winter. We get an average 200 inches of snow each winter. Her and her boyfriend do not want to split the cost in it. 

I initially suggested a 3 way split but they said no. Together they make more than me, but I make more than each of them individually, so I compromised and said we could go halves on it if money is an issue. They still said no. They don’t want to spend money on a snowblower, they’ll shovel. 

Well, I want a snow blower but I would be upset getting stuck not only paying for the whole cost of it but then them benefitting from it if I were to be the one to always take care of the driveway. Would I be an asshole if I bought a snow blower and only snowblow half the driveway while they shovel? I only do 1/3rd of it now, so doing half would still be more than I do now, just less physical labor. 

For more context: my sisters side of the duplex is the quiet side… there’s no neighbors on her side while the neighbors on mine awful. She lived here for 6 months more than me, actually lived in my side then moved over because of the neighbors when my side was originally the one she wanted. Her side is also bigger. They have closer parking than me. They have taken over 90% of the basement with all their storage. When I moved in they refused to let me use their washer/dryer while I waited for mine to be delivered. They also took over the patio/backyard and shed with their stuff.

I have offered to mow many times because she lets it get very long and then it’s hard for me to pick up dog poop and my dog eats the grass. I want to help but she refuses to let me. There is a lock on the shed that I don’t have a key to. This makes me feel like even if I let her use the snowblower for her half of the driveway, she would refuse saying it’s not her job/her snowblower and I would get stuck doing it all anyways. 

So all this considered, I wouldn’t really feel bad but would like some opinions anyways, because I’m sure my parents will hear about this and take her side.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4810095,public,top,self,WIBTA if I bought a snow blower and didn’t let my sister use it?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0h8lk/wibta_if_i_bought_a_snow_blower_and_didnt_let_my/,all_ads,6,,,

We have been together for three months and are in love.

When goofing around, she decided seemingly out of the blue to tell me that she has teased her previous partners by blowing air into their foreskins (yup, you read that right), and that she'll have to tease me in a different way as I'm circumsized. I became very uncomfortable when she told me this. I'll be straight: I don't want the imagery of my girlfriend blowing air into other dudes' foreskins in my head, and feel like this is a normal and expected thing for a man to not want. I worry that those images may pop into my head and spoil our moments of genuine intimacy.

I expressed all of this to her in a constructive way, and she replied that she saw my point of view (and she apologized). However, for some reason I'm fucking confused about the whole situation and feel like I’m somehow being problematic here. I feel that in any new relationship, it's expected at baseline that one protect each other from potential psychological discomfort by not sharing overly explicit sexual details about previous partners. I'm angry with her and feel that she's an asshole for violating this principle.

Am I being overly sensitive for reacting negatively to this? Should I be concerned about my own behavior here, or was it completely justified and normal? AITA for being grossed out and expressing this?

I am in the retail business and work in a store that is basically an outdoors store. We have knives, axes, guns, and camping stuff. We even have some local artists handmade knives. Well they get pretty expensive, and that's fine, we still let them hold the knives. However we have some handmade axes. At the lowest cost its 800, reasonable no one has a problem with it. Well we have a protocol that only serious buyers can hold them, because they are heavy, expensive, and of handled wrong they can get hurt, or damage stuff. A week ago I had three people come in. All were nice, except one of them. Let's call him person b, and the others a, and c. Well b got really interested in our axes and was talking to a and c.
 B comes over and asks what's the price of one of the axes. I tell him,' it's 800.' 
And he goes' ok.' Then he goes back to talking with the people he was with. He comes back and says, 'can I hold it.' I told him 'no, not unless you are serious of buying it. We don't let customers hold it due to liability issues.'
 Next thing I knew he turned around in a fit and stormed out of the store. A and c gathered up their stuff and brought it to the check out. 
A apologizes and I tell him it's fine I've delt with worse. 
Well while I was checking out b comes back all mad and asks for my name. I tell him and he tells me' I'm leaving a bad review!' I just ignored him, because you can't stop that from happening everyone has a chance to leave a review and what they think is the best review for them. 
Anyways I get a and c checked out and they leave. Not too long after that b comes back in and told me.
 
     ' my friends convinced me not to write a bad review. But I think that you were horrible to me and telling me that I couldn't afford it.'
 I replied. 'I did not mean it that way, I just have to follow protocol. I was just saying if you were serious you could, but u didn't tell me u were.' 
B says' I shouldn't have to. What u did is bad customer service, you have bad customer service.' He goes on and on about bad customer service.

 I tell him I don't judge and didn't think  he couldn't pay for it. And that I'm sorry he felt that way' he didn't like that and so he stormed out of the store again. 
I didn't have time to tell him that I am autistic and don't get the hints that others get. I have to have someone tell me they are going to buy it, or if they are serious about it. I can't just tell when someone needs something or if they want something.

Finally, that time of the year were I can make my delicious homemade Italian tortellini sausage cream soup... yes, it's my comfort  food. 
My MIL is staying with us, and she tends to clean the house while here, which I deeply  appreciate it.  But she has a tendency to ruin the things  I own.  I'm not overreacting or being over dramatic . Washing clothes  while we're at work  my clothes have bleach  marks.  Everyone else's is perfectly  fine.  Things of mine come up missing  and show up  in her room where she is staying example I had just received a brand new perfume I had been asking for  for a couple of years at that point . It went missing, and  she had no idea what I was talking  about. Then, when she left and we went to change out her sheets, I found my perfume bottles broken being used as a little flower vase. 



Of course, I spoke to my wife about this.  She blows me off by stating oh you know how my mom is  or ""she's old, we won't have her for that long let it go.  I don't want to be the one who disrespects my wife's  my mom, but damn her pettiness  gets old, especially  since my wife blows my issues off.


But this woman does this to all the other siblings' spouses in regards to moving things around. 

Ok, so to my beautiful delicious soup. 

I took my time and prepared  it. I was the only one to have a bowl cause by this time it was ready it was late in the day and everyone had eaten already. 

I see no one's going to eat any, so I put the entire pot in the fridge  cause in my mind that's my brunch, and I'm just going reheat it straight from the pot. 

It should be noted I let my wife know that I put the soup in the fridge before laying  down for bed.

I wake up I'm excited  for the fridge and no pot!
Look around and my pot is in the sink empty..... look around  maybe someone  put it in a to-go container. Don't see it anywhere. 

So I called my wife, and she said I threw it out.... I'm like, why? Why would you throw it out???
She says we'll you left it out all night...
No, I didn't  it was safe in the fridge, and I let you know this when I came to bed....

I'm so upset 😡  I'm know what happened .... my MIL happened, and my wife is taking the blame,  so I won't tell her mom anything .

So I've put my wife in the no talk no touch zone!

Over the past few months, my girlfriend (22f) has had a recurring stressor in her finances. She is a masters student, and I (22m) work full time to support us both. She has a paid internship ($10/hr) that will give her a few hundred bucks every few weeks. This helps lighten the financial load on us both, and we use it for food and just random expenses when needed. However, about a year ago, my girlfriend was living with 3 roommates instead all of whom were close friends dating back to high school. When they were out taking graduation photos, my girlfriend placed her friend's (22f) phone down on a statue briefly. The phone then fell and cracked the screen/back of the phone. My girlfriend was extremely upset and said she would reimburse her friend for the damages. 

Fast forward a year later, her friend has recently been asking her for $550 to repair the phone. My girlfriend has been extremely anxious as she can't really afford that without completely emptying her bank account. My girlfriend doesn't want my input about the situation as she's very defensive of her friend, but I think this request is completely unreasonable. Yes, she said she would pay, but that offer was valid a year ago. If it was so important, she should have gotten that price estimate when it had freshly occurred. Also, I can't personally speak to pricing, but isn't it $550 for a cracked screen/back quite high? I just don't see her friend being justified in this ask, I feel it's malicious and just her wanting money from my girlfriend without taking her possible finances into concern.

Among her many critiques was the fact that she found me too negative, which was particularly hard to hear while grieving, especially given I'd been trying really hard to keep my grief contained. It made me feel like I couldn't tell anyone how sad I was, like I had to keep it all to myself to avoid being a burden, and made the grief exponentially harder to get through. We've been in a stalemate ever since, where she refuses to apologize because she says the things she said were honest, and I want to see some recognition from her that, however honest the sentiment, the timing and context were inappropriate. I keep trying to find ways to smooth it over in my head and make it okay, because I know it's the only way our friendship will survive, and because the rest of our friends seem to think that the onus is on me to forgive her and not her to make amends. She is, famously, not someone who believes in apologizing. I don't think I would be upset if she'd said the things she did on a random Tuesday, instead of a few weeks after this loss, or if she had just at any point said ""hey, I'm sorry, even if this is true I should've been more thoughtful about what you're dealing with right now"" without immediately following with more attacks. I've tried to explain this to her, that I just need some sign that she has even a small amount of empathy for what I was going through at the time, and she seems happy to lose our friendship rather than take any accountability. Am I the asshole for needing that kind of resolution from her? And am I the asshole for letting go of our friendship if it's something that she can't, for whatever reason, give?

When we were trying to get pregnant we talked about potential baby names and I reminded him that if we had a girl I’ve always wanted to name her after my grandmother, Adra, who’s been hugely influential on my life. After explaining my reasoning for the name, my husband agreed. We started to think about potential middle names and landed on the name “Elaine”; we both liked it and he was excited because he thought one of his grandmothers middle name was “Elaine”. Ironically, my mother’s middle name is “Elaine” and I’ve always liked it. It felt like it was perfect and we both agreed that the name flowed really well.
If the baby was a boy we agreed to name him after my members of my husbands family -Riensford Leslie
My husbands mother is quite controlling and likes to flex that control- she had to invite her best friends to our small backyard wedding. My husband, although he sees an issue with her behaviour will never stand up to her. 
Last week, MIL dropped off baby name books despite knowing we have had names picked out for months. This weekend my husband went to visit her. As soon as he got home he mentioned that we should reconsider the girls name because he just realized that it has no significance for his family and he doesn’t see why my grandmother needs a tribute.
I’m adamant that the name isn’t changing; it shouldn’t matter that the girls name we picked out has no significance to his family when the boys name has all kinds of significance.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4810062,public,top,self,AITA FOR TELLING MY HUSBAND OFF FOR WANTING TO CHANGE BABY NAMES AFTER WVE BEEN IN AGREEMENT FOR MONTHS UNTIL HE WENT TO VISIT MY MIL?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0gsfe/aita_for_telling_my_husband_off_for_wanting_to/,all_ads,6,,,

My dog usually poops after i've been to the shop, so I'm carrying a bag with my drink and whatever essentials i grabbed. 
On any other day I would put my bag on the floor while i pick up after my dog, but today it was raining and i had eggs in there. So i placed it on the nearest wheelie bin, waited for my dog to finish her post-poop dance, picked up the poop, and put it in the bin after taking my bag. 
Before i could start walking away, a woman that i assume lived in the house which bin i borrowed was leaning out of the open window above me and said ""do you pay for that?""
i said ""what?"" and then she said again ""do you pay for the council to pick up these bins? if not why are you using it?""

i was a bit stunned, and i don't do well with confrontation so i just tripped over my words trying to tell her i only have two hands, it's hard for me to pick up the dog mess and hold the bag at the same time. 

She then accused me of littering and leaving dog mess everywhere (the streets in my area are kinda bad for neglected dog mess, but i always pick up my dog's). and said it's disrespectful to use other people's property without permission. oh and she ""has 3 kids so bin space is precious.""

i didn't wanna stand in the rain listening to this crap anymore so i cut her off and said if she couldn't handle me using her bin for a second i'd happily leave it on the street in front of her door next time. and then walked home. pretty sure i heard her slam the window behind me.

I personally had/have no use for it yet, so she is the one who drives it to work and takes me places/to work, etc. when I need a ride. We currently don't live together yet, but we planned to share the car once we got an apartment together. 

My parents are pissed that I did this because I didn't tell them (I live with them). They're also pissed that I don't have the car since the title is in my name and they don't trust my partner with it (they didn't know I had been seeing her). They wanted me to take the vehicle from her and offered to reimburse her for her half of the down payment. I didn't want this. 

All week my mom kept pestering me with questions about my partner and the car. Today she absolutely lost it and demanded to see the contract I signed from the dealership. I told her no, but that I would answer any questions they had about the car. She accused me of hiding something from her and kept asking to see it. I kept rejecting her. 

The reason I don't want my parents to see it is because of how they treat me. They *demand* to know everything, they pressure me into doing what they want me to do because I live in their house. Because I did this they said I lost their trust. 

I feel like my mom is emotionally manipulating me because she keeps telling me repeatedly how stressed this situation has made her. I feel sympathy for her, but that's really her problem. How am I supposed to make any moves in life if I have to constantly be considering her stress levels? 

My mom even threatened to call the police and say my partner stole the car just to get it back. She said it's the last thing she'd want to do, but then she keeps repeatingly mentioning that whenever we talk about the car. So I don't trust her. 

I feel like what I'm doing is the right thing for me, but maybe I'm being too reluctant towards their advances? I know they care about me and are looking out for me. It's just hard to be open with people who have an extreme reaction to anything they have no control over. They say I made a mistake by buying the car, but I don't think so.

It was a messy relationship and an even messier break up. He had always been rude to me, he had always disregarded my feelings, and more. I broke up with him over call because my parents wouldn’t allow me to go out past 7Pm and I was very nice about it. I said that he was a good guy, but he just wasn’t the one for me. I even apologized for breaking up with him since I wasn’t kn the right mental space and therefore couldn’t continue the relationship any longer. He immediately started screaming, and called me an asshole. I told him I was done with him and that was that. Until school started again this year . I broke up with him in august and so when I started school everyone that I had originally been friends with hated me and I wasn’t sure why. I was very upset and I didn’t want to be on my own so I asked one of my old friends why they had stopped talking to me. They said it was because of the stuff I did to my ex and I was very confused. I figured out through one person I was still friends with that my ex had been lying about me being rude, and mean to them when they themselves had literally been racist to me before. What makes the matter even worse is that the fact they started deadnaming me even though we were both trans. Later that day I got a text from one of my old friends saying, “Not to be involved or anything but what you did to miles was messed up” I was confused and they had told me that they believed my ex instead of me which broke me since nobody believed me except for one person. They then started to defend their racist actions and went onto say that I didn’t know what racism was, I got mad (reasonably) and told them that they were never there for me.
