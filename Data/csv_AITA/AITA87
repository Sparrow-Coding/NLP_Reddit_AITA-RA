I came out to my parents and sister about 2 years ago shortly after the pandemic started. They were great and really supportive especially since my sister had already come out as well. The problem came recently when my dad outed not just me but my sister to our aunt who had some choice words to say about how we identify. My dad and aunt were talking about politics and the news about a recent shooting, my dad expressed worry about my sister and me because we are LGBTQ+. This went into my dad and mom telling her that we both identify as queer, then my aunt asking if that meant we changed our pronouns and everything else about us being queer. I choose not to tell my dad's and mom's side about me being queer because most of their families are old and can act like they are boomers and Karens about subjects of sexual identity and gender identity. I am out to my friends and people I love, who want to know.

My parents said it was not a big deal that they told her and we shouldn't be upset about it, but I am. I expressed so and my mom said no one will care and that we just need to move on from it. It was not by my choice that my family knew and that is the part that upsets me the most. My aunt is the gossip of the family and I know for a fact she tells everyone on my dad's side of the family our business. I do not get to have a choice anymore of who knows now and that is why I am upset about it.

I agreed and will be paying for my own expenses in full. I’m still in university and am not earning, so I’ve been saving up for this big trip. 

His dad is going on the same work trip (they work in the same company) and has requested that we join them in travelling around to “save costs”. However, after much calculation done, I realised that travelling solo is much cheaper as his parents prefer staying in hotels than airbnbs and would prefer to eat in restaurants most of the time over cooking our own meals. Their colleagues will also be tagging along for the trip, so it will be a big group of 8 or 9 people. 

I initially suggested that we follow them for the first half of the trip and split after a bit to do our own itinerary, but my boyfriend has been reluctant to even bring it up to them. He told me to say it to his parents myself because I’m the one who wants to travel separately and he’s okay with travelling with them. I disagreed on it and refused to be the one that brings it up to his parents because I am in no position to debate with them about us travelling solo, and that it’s my boyfriend’s parents so I felt like he’s in a better position to do so. 

I told him that I can’t afford to spend about $3000 on a trip just to compromise to what other people want to do, so I told him that to make things easier I could just not go. He mentioned that this is a special trip for us and he wants to spend it with me. He then proceeded to be annoyed at me for not being willing to compromise. I just can’t afford to compromise on this trip. I’d save about $1000 travelling alone with my boyfriend.

Jack would often snatch my phone out of my hands at lunch and I would spend the whole lunch period trying to get it back, and usually by the time I would get it back it would be time for class, leaving me no time to eat.

We hit it off and she has many qualities I seek. We talked after I got back home but she grew distant so I took it as disinterest though she said ""nothing has changed"". 

Near the end of my trip, i had been chatting with Stacy, who wasn't ready to date so we intended to be hiking partners/friends. But when we met up a few times we REALLY connected and we decided to be intimate (exclusive yet non-committal/casual). All was well and good. She told me not to get attached and I explained to her it was just psychical and that my emotional needs were being met by another woman, so it wouldn't happen. Neither woman were a girlfriend and I was sexually exclusive with Stacy. 

I planned on visiting Lisa in February. Stacy and I agreed that these 6 months would be awesome.  However, plans were made in early November to go see Lisa.  But if I went back l, I would lose Stacy.  I decided to cancel my trip and chose Stacy. I really think she's my person.

I told Stacy that bailing on Lisa would hurt her very much. Fortunately, Lisa is under the impression there was a system error that caused my ticket to get canceled and not my personal choice. This saved her from some pain. She expects me to come in February still and I will not be going. I wanted to tell her this but I felt it more kind to wait until December. I thought it would be just cruel to tell her I found someone else after she was so excited I was coming. I didn't want to drive her into depression because of my choices. 

I have kept up chatting every few days, trying to stay neutral  but also making her feel good saying things like good morning and hey beautiful and catching up like friends would. I told Stacy my plan and i haven't lied to her or misled her in any way about this situation (or about anything for that matter). Stacy has unfettered access to my phone because I have nothing to hide. Last night she saw my ig messages with Lisa and says it's very inappropriate (she's not even my gf yet but we are now dating). I don't call Lisa baby or say love or anything of the sort. I do send kiss emotional when I say beautiful tho. But we've always been like that.

Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language.

Me (30F) and my husband (34M) have been together for 13 years, married for 3. My relationship with his family has always been good up until we moved in together - they started being snarky and creating drama for no reason all the time. Some of his family missed our wedding, no explanation whatsoever, and my husband says he doesn't care and it's not a big deal. So I tried to put it behind me and let it go.
Last year, we had a baby, and the reaction from his family was ice cold. No gifts, no excitement, zero. They have almost no interaction with our daughter, the only time they spend together is when my husband goes over with the baby as a kind of reminder that they have a grandchild (it is their first grandchild as well). They don't call, and even when my husband calls, they never ask about the baby.
I decided I don't want any interaction with them since they don't seem to care about my child, but can't impose my feelings about them on my daughter, so I agree that my husband visits without me about once a month.

Fast forward to Christmas. We decided to host Christmas dinner this year as it is easier then having to deal with a sleepy baby elsewhere but home. We have done the same last year, but my in-laws refused to come over, so we compromised and had lunch with them the next day.  By doing that, my mom ended up feeling hurt, because she spent Christmas day by herself - my father passed away a few months before my daughter was born, and I'm an only child. 
My mom helps me everyday, picks my daughter up from daycare when I run late from work, brings me food, and is genuinely the best help I could ever ask for (my husband works nights, btw).
So this year we let the in-laws know we are hosting, and they said they're not coming, but are expecting us on Christmas day for lunch. I don't wanna leave my mom, my biggest support system, down and alone, and I don't want to have to spend Christmas day with people who don't like me or my daughter. If I tell my husband I'm not coming, he's gonna be upset, which I understand, it's a major holiday, but I feel like his family should remember we exist all year long.

It's a kind of convoluted story, so I'll try to break down the players somewhat succinctly.

Neighbor A lives in my building. They have cats, and had been feeding what they thought was a stray a month or so prior. They put a cat box out for her too, and she pretty much lived on their porch. Eventually, apartment management saw the cat outside, took a photo, and sent an apartment-wide email asking who she belonged to. Neighbor A tried to just take her inside and introduce her to their cats, but they didn't get along.

The cat approached Neighbor B, who picked her up to bring her in for the night as it was getting colder out. But Neighbor B has a dog, who doesn't get along with cats. So they couldn't keep her long term, and Neighbor A couldn't keep her either. Knowing that I had cats, they asked me if I'd be willing to at least temporarily house her. I agreed, and we decided we'd do the exchange the next day after work, so I had time to get extra supplies to keep her in the guest bedroom for a few days before introducing her to my cats.

Well, the owner contacted management about the email. They claimed she'd gotten out and they'd been looking for her, and that she was their mother's cat who lives in a different city. Neighbor B gave the cat back to the owner, and we figured she would be returned to their mother and never seen from again.

But about a week later, a few days ago now, the cat shows back up on Neighbor A's porch begging for food and crying to be let inside. We're all a little puzzled, but I've temporarily put her up in my guest bedroom with all the supplies she'd need. I don't actually know who she belongs to. According to my neighbor, she's not microchipped. It seems that her owner lied about the cat not living here, and unless they're extraordinarily bad at herding her, they put her out on purpose. I doubt that it's an accident too, because our buildings have regular apartment doors and then main doors as well. So her getting out multiple times on total accident is a little hard to believe. It's winter here, it's cold out. Rainy and below freezing, often times. And the cars don't drive slowly in our parking lots, so any outdoor animals are liable to get hit.

I know the right thing to do would be to ask Neighbor B for the owner's contact info, or contact management about finding her again. But I'm just worried something will happen to her when she's inevitably put outside again. I'm kind of thinking that, unless we get another email from management about the cat being lost and the owner looking for her, maybe I just... keep her.

The restaurant I work in is owned by a man and a woman. No HR, no higher up boss than these two. The man is ok, if not great, but the woman is openly bipolar and doesn’t take her medicine. 

Because of this she’s started taking trash and “recycling” it, but what that really means is taking all the beer bottles and styrofoam, filling up old pickle buckets with them, and storing them behind the bar within customer view. She also has tons of inventory in another room accessible by customers and it’s completely impossible to shop for the products in there because of it. She also has at least 3 changes of clothes and I threw away a ton of food with three bites taken out of it last week. I can’t confirm she pulled them from the bus bin but it was days old by the time I got to it. 

There’s 13 buckets of empty bottles, there’s at least 50 empty wine bottles on the counter, there’s styrofoam boxes she has torn apart and stacked, and they sit for so long that they get water marks on them. 

She has now mandated that we keep the tap covers on all of the taps near the sink where she washes off all her trash. BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY FLIES AND THEH KEEP GETTING IN PEOPLES BEER. she takes an electric fly swagger to these flies in front of customers. 

Today I found A FEATHER in the cup washing sink and I went nuclear and rewatched every cup in the restaurant because of it. 

A coworker BROKE HER FOOT tripping on a mat that was stuck on a bucket of empty beer bottles. 

I said thank you to her, for cleaning glasses. This is a server responsibility. She only yelled at me for idk what. This is a repeat occurrence. I just stopped thanking her. 

We have a cool little brewery that is now inaccessible due to her trash piling up. 

There’s 1/5 a jug of EXPIRED MILK in the wine cooler. I’ve thrown it away three times and it keeps coming back. 

When I threw away moldy pizza crusts wrapped w Saran Wrap in a bowl, she took them out of the trash and wrote “*name*, don’t throw away” on the box she put them in. 

She threatened to fire someone for taking pictures of her mess. “I’ll see you in court when you sue me! It’s your problem if you want to leave!” 

Someone called the health dept before, and they moved all the buckets into the brewery because it’s “outside their jurisdiction” 

This bullshit is also completely out of the kitchen. No trash piles up back there and they’re really good about out of date stuff and trash back there.

The reason I’m not automatically on the phone w the health department, is because the management that ISNT her, is great and we very well could get shut down over this shit.

My new roommates are nice but we're not really friends, we're just roommates. 
They probably think I'm antisocial but that's not true. Truth is, I've been through a lot these past two years and it has completely changed me. 

A little back story. 

I lost my parents to covid in 2020 and life has been pretty different since they passed away. 
I slowly crept into depression shortly after their death and depression has been a part of me ever since. Depression has made me isolate myself from most of my friends and family. 

We were a small, happy family. We weren't rich but we were comfortable and we cared for each other. 
Then covid happened in 2020 and somehow it took the two people in the world that mattered the most to me. 

I'd have to find my path alone, and to be honest, It's been pretty tough. 

I've been working in retail for the past two years and I hate it because the pay is really low and I mostly live paycheck to paycheck. But I have to do it to pay the bills until I find a better paying job. 

Yesterday one of my roommates texted me to remind that we'd be paying for the electric bill on Sunday and I responded with: 'Ok no problem'.
 
Truth is, I'm a little short on the electric bill. I wanted to tell her that over text but I just thought it'd be best to explain the situation to her in person since it'd be easier and less embarrassing. 

Unfortunately when I got home after my shift (at 9pm), she was already asleep so I just thought I'd talk to her about it this morning. 

This morning I tried to explain to her that I'm a little short on the electric bill and I'd pay the balance when I get paid next week but she was mad at me and was kinda yelling at me that I should've just said that over text instead of waiting till the next day. 
Then she said she'd flip the breakers to my room off if I didn't have the complete amount for my share of the bill by tomorrow. 

I didn't know what else to say so I just apologized and went into my room. 

I've been a bit depressed and pondering over the whole situation. 

Should I have explained everything to her over text rather than wait?

I just graduated high school and am currently working full time trying to save. I’m still with my parents, but only for the next year. Year 12 was stressful. I was in a shitty relationship for 8 months which sparked depression, got in a car accident, had my brother begin to bleed out infront of me and rush him to the hospital, my dog die and of course exams all within less than a year.

It’s been hectic, which affected my mental health. It’s normal, when you’re depressed you don’t care how clean your room is. For me it got to where I couldn’t brush my teeth.

I’m better now, just a lil numb here and there.

My mum’s crazy when it comes to cleaning. I appreciate her so much and am so grateful for her. Without her I’d still be the same as before. She’d remind me to take my meds, eat, shower and support me through school. 

It was always hot and cold. We’d always had a rough relationship, but it’s better now.

One thing that’s remained the same is her constant need to clean. 

I’ve told her about all this and she understands, but she randomly come in, complain my rooms messy and then clean it. It’s frustrating because I feel useless.

I’ve told her I understand this is her house, but this is my room and I’ll deal with the consequences of a messy room.

It is physically and mentally impossible to get myself to clean my room. It’s like procrastination on steroids. I wish I could show a photo of what it looks like now. Theres a box of things on my carpet in the corner, and my desk has some books spread out on it.

Mum came in earlier, trying to put things away, but I physically cringe when I don’t do it myself and put it where I think it belongs. I think the procrastinating is because it takes so long to decide where something goes.

The convo goes:

Me: “stop mum I’ll put it away myself”

Mum: it never gets done. i always do it

Me: that’s your choice to touch my stuff. i know its your house but this is my room. it’s my fault if its messy. stop touching my things, ive told you so many times. i appreciate what you do but i feel useless when youre constantly doing things for me. ill build up the motivation and do it myself.

Mum: you never will. im the only one who does anything.

Me: its as simple as dont touch whats in my room. i know its messy but its my room and my responsibility 

she then got mad and left, slamming my door.

i feel like such an ass. i know the obvious answer is clean my room, but it goes deeper than this. she invades everything, my privacy, my relationships. She doesnt knock and walks right in even when I’m naked. It’s just i feel constantly violated. My room is my safe space and the one thing I have control over. Having that removed drives me nuts.

This affair is in the past. Now the guy became my student (S) not knowing who I am.

In a nutshell. My ex (X) and I dated on and of for years. We didn't have a healthy relationship. We both thought we were soul mates. We were toxic. We both hurt each other. I still think about her almost every day, unfortunately.

The last time I courted her was in 2020. She was single on social media, and I texted her. I asked her out, she resisted. I tried very hard. She got confused. I confessed love. She confessed that she had a BF. X said that she had to meet me to be know how she feels. Her BF gave her permission to meet me in order to clear her feelings. She wanted to stay with her BF but she wanted to meet me to see more clearly. X asked me if I was ok with this. I said I was. The meeting didn't work out well. X wanted to stay with her BF, but he was understandably upset. X told me that she wanted BF but she was still confused so she asked me to wait for her. They broke up.. I tought I had a chance.  
X didn't want to meet because she was exhausted. It turned that they met again, had sex, and discussed that X can keep in touch with me. X told me via text message that her BF agreed, as she told him that she was not attracted to me physically. At first I was aimable and accepted her decision, but reading her words about keeping in touch because we got the permission from BF after they had sex made me see red.   
I chose no contact. We had one last petty fight with X, then she blocked me. I was devestated.

They were together for 1.5 months. Then I don't know what happened. X had another boyfriend for 2 years after that. Now she is single. I moved on.

The problem is the following: Im a private language teacher. I girl contacted me on messenger that she wants to study with me in person. She woudl come with her BF. 2 students 1 teacher. They paid for lessons in advance. When they walked in to the entrance hall, I realised that S is my X's BF. The guy who was her BF 2 years ago not anymore. S = X's exBF. I checked messenger. X unblocked me but stayed silent. S liked her freshest profile pic. S didn't recognise me. It was very awkward for me put I kept my mouth shut.

We were going to head over there early. I was pretty excited for it. I love her family. Even though sometimes there isn't much to talk about because I am a very different person. For example, i am not religious, I smoke weed all day and I love psychedelics. 

However, I obviously don't tell them these things and I am very polite, clean and respectful around them. Anyway, today as we were about to leave, I had finished getting dressed and decided to ask my gf, ""so... What's the plan for today?"" 

And that's when my girlfriend finally decided to be more up front about something... The plan was to sit and watch an anime that her little brother is obsessed with. Apparently a new season came out of that show and my gf had promised her little brother they would binge watch it together. I was completely unaware of this until my gf told me last minute. 

I freaked out and said ""you won't even watch a single lord of the rings movie with me but you expect me to sit for 4 hours to watch an anime I don't even care about?! No thanks, I'm staying home.""

 I would also like to add that lately I've been struggling with alcoholism and I am at the end of a withdrawal. As in I had my last drink recently. I try to keep myself busy with coffee, video games and weed. But I started panicking how I could possibly sit in absolute boredom at her families house. I knew I would just start getting cravings and want to just leave. 

So I stayed home and she understood but is a little bit upset. Lately, a lot of these miscommunications have been happening and I always end up being upset at her and she ends up either crying or feeling like a victim. Meanwhile, I think I'm the victim being put through all of this when my life is already so so hard as it is....

I’m a customer host in charge of checking receipts at our store. I’m out in the garden area gate which is outside. It’s like, 40 degrees F outside. So not majorly cold but still pretty cold, especially in the shade. I hear this dog crying and a couple customers are looking for it too. I find the dog in a mostly covered crate and figure to just leave it until the customer comes back as it’s probably okay. 20 minutes pass and another customer notices the dog and says she sees some guy in the parking lot clearly out of his head looking for it, not even realizing he’s assumedly in his crate attached to his bike.  I look at the dog a little as we’re all a little concerned for him at this point. His crate, while big enough to definitely hold him, is not super big for him to be in for an extended period of time as he can probably barely spin around in it in appearance and can’t fully stand without crouching his head a little. He’s a pit bull who’s pretty big but clearly not fully grown. The customers are also worried and are wanting animal control called since the dog’s owner is clearly not in the right frame of mind to care for him and we don’t know how long this dog is gonna be left here. It’s been nearly 30 minutes now (that I know of) that this dog has been in this mostly covered crate outside and I’m getting worried now to. I love dogs and all animals and don’t want this dog to be hurt, I’d never forgive myself if he were and I could prevent it. So I start to call animal control, but as I’m on the phone with the operator this guy comes out the garden gate and says not to call animal control on his dog and he knows his rights and the law and to mind my business. He’s followed  by one of my coworkers from the garden department Emily who walks with me back into the garden department and asks what’s going on. I explain that the dog has been out there for like going on an hour and I was worried about him since it’s kind of cold and he’s in a small mostly covered crate, and the customers and I thought he belonged to the afformentioned mentally unsound man looking around the parking lot for someone. She got pissed at me and told me his crate was not too small, he was their dog and he’d only been outside for 10 minutes using her dad’s receipt as a time stamp. (This only shows when he checked out not how long he was in the store or dropped the dog off). I apologized, stating I just misunderstood the situation.

When it was time for me and my siblings to share our lists with our mother I explained that I wanted on brand, new, AirPods. My older and younger brothers told me that I was being ungrateful and that I should just use the ones I already have even though they’re almost 5 years old now. I thought it would be okay to ask for the AirPods since my older brother got an iPad and and my little brother got a PS4 for their birthdays, but my little brother snapped on me saying that I was stressing my mom out even more and that I should just stop being an ungrateful A-hole and suck it up. I don’t think I’m being ungrateful but part of me still feels like I shouldn’t have asked even though AirPods are only around 100+ dollars.

We'll call him Crusty. Crusty spoke to me once when my husband and I were first dating, and decided he couldn't stand me. Fine, whatever. I had already learned a long time before then, that you could be the sweetest peach on the tree but some people just don't like peaches. I also figured that, in time, he might come around or we could at the very least coexist relatively peacefully, you know, like adults. 

     However, he has said things to my husband about me in the past that were hurtful(insults about my weight, about my looks in general as well as my intelligence. He even joked that he could set my husband up with someone way hotter than me). My husband did tell him off about it; he stuck up for me but he also didn't want to lose his friend which I was understanding of. I just resolved that Crusty burned a bridge with me, not my husband. 

     Flash forward a couple of years, husband and I just had our first child 2 months back. Crusty also had a child about 6 months ago. He now seems to want to try to be friends with me, likely because his wife will want to set up play dates when our babies are older. The problem is, I'm hesitant to forgive him. Part of me fears he will do it again, and also that his child will have similar behaviors, and I do not want my daughter to grow up and think that it's okay to be a bully.

     My husband thinks I'm being immature and that I should just let bygones be bygones. I can see why he thinks that. It happened years ago and it was seemingly dealt with, despite the fact that Crusty never apologized (he likely doesn't even remember what he did according to my husband). It's just that the insults really stuck with me and I've always struggled with self image issues (including a mild eating disorder) and that doesn't help.

I have 5 and 7 year old boys from a previous marriage, and my husband have a 1 year old and one more on the way.

I’ve been frustrated with SS’s behaviors for a long time - mostly extreme rudeness toward everyone basically all the time. The main issue, though, is that I’m not able to discipline him - he argues with me and flat out refuses to do anything I say. Because of this, I’m not an authority and I can’t control him. So I’ve tried to leave discipline to my husband and just remove myself if SS is using language I don’t tolerate but my husband does.

He recently shot up in height and is now more than twice the size of the smaller kids and 5 inches taller than me. At the same time, his play with other kids (which always involved aggravating them and usually ended in another child crying) has become rougher and more physical.

This holiday week, we had a house full of little cousins, all who are also WAY smaller than him. Kids were constantly coming to us crying or reporting that he had held them down and sat on them, grabbed them and locked them in a room, dunked them underwater in the hot tub over and over, and more, plus calling them losers or telling them they suck. When I tried to intervene on the name-calling and send my stepson to another room or end the game (the name-calling is so pervasive he’s on a one-strike policy with me) he would stand his ground and look me right in the eye and refuse. So I sent complaining kids to my husband so he could discipline his son, since I can’t, but my husband insisted they were just “play fighting” and “roughhousing” and being boys and I was ruining the boy fun. I saw serious bullying and physical safety issues, and eventually my husband agreed to separate my stepson from the younger kids.

My kids are scared and don’t want to be around him, so I promised them and told my husband I’m not letting him play with them at all.

Stepson is usually in his room playing video games so it won’t be that hard to enforce as the custody schedules don’t overlap that much anyway. I told my husband I’m also not willing to supervise my stepson because I cannot control him and he doesn’t behave safely, and I don’t see my husband intervening where he should either so basically I’m not willing to be around him at all until something changes. When he respects me, I will gladly hang out and play games and watch movies with him again, but not until then. When he has the absolute fear of God in him about tormenting smaller children he can be around my kids again, but not until then.

My husband is super sad because he wants my stepson to feel at home and accepted here and he feels I am bullying a child by shaming him. I do feel bad as SS wants to connect with me and be part of things, and my husband is super involved and sweet with my own boys.

My little who's 9 really wants this hair style she keeps seeing online. But the problem is most the people with the hair style have much straighter hair than her. (He was 3a-3c hair depending on the day) I looked it up and saw that if we gave her the hair cut, it would look nothing like what she wanted and a waste of time, and possibly might even look bad on her. I looked up what the hair style looks like on 3a and 3c hair and it looks totally awesome but it still doesn't look like what she wanted, it actually looks way different which makes sense due to the fact the hair is much curlier than who the hair style was made for. The only other hair styles she likes is box braids and super straightened hair which usually damage's her hair after a while and she gets uncomfy wearing box braids after a while. She also hates her natural hair as well as most black people's natural hair in general as well as most types of curly hair and I don't know how to help her out because she has curly hair and can't accept it. I kept refusing to let her cut her hair because it just won't work, she kept begging and almost crying. I didn't have it in my heart to explain to her that she will most likely never be able to hair that hair style so I just kept saying no with no explanation and now she hates me.

There was about a month between him asking me how I felt about that and him marrying her). Of course when he married her he instantly moved her in.

The main downside on that though- she has 4 kids. And we lived in a 2 bedroom house. So ALL of her kids moved into my room. When they were moving in, I was told I had to downsize everything I owned. I was fine with it at first, took some stuff out of my closet to make room for their clothes. Then my dad told me it wasn't enough. It wasn't enough until I took out about 90% of what I owned at that point (which a lot I had bought with money that my mom left me specifically). Then he proceeded to give EVERYTHING to my new step sisters. And kicked me out. I was able to move in with my at the time boyfriend/now husband but even 6 years later, I honestly haven't gotten past the betrayal of all that. My only living parent kicked me out to make space for his new family he replaced me with, since at the time I was looking at going to college and possibly moving away. I actually ended up dropping out because I couldn't handle the stress I was going through with them all at the time, I was getting creepy texts about how if I ever went ""home"" my cats would be hung over my bed or I wouldn't wake up. I sent my dad screenshots but everything I said was just blown off because ""it couldn't have been them that's not their phone number""

There are two main items though that I know my stepsisters still have, that I'd like to get back. I just don't know if I'd be the asshole for asking. I didn't really want to get rid of them at the time but was told it was that or something else I cared about, and chose the other thing. Both gifts from my mom, a Nintendo DS I had as a kid and an old sewing machine that's been passed down. Neither thing is used by any of my stepsisters, actually one of them just keeps both in her closet just to have them (she and I have major issues with each other, that's a long story but basically she hates me for the fact I grew up with a better life since she's the oldest and was basically free childcare since she was like 8, I understand and I've always been sympathetic to her but I can't help that we were raised differently, I mean I'm a couple years younger than her even)

And it's not like I've done nothing for them, when they first moved in I had 20k but by the time I was kicked out (Abt 2 months later) I was dead broke (and believe me I wouldn't have done it had my dad not said he'd pay me back for any expenses for them, but hey guess what he didn't lol surprise there, screw 17 year old me for being that dumb), so I literally gave them a complete and total headstart to the future I'll never get back for myself off of the inheritance I got from my mom, would it be wrong to ask for the things I got from my mom back?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4827512,public,top,self,WIBTA for asking for my stuff back,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5g3ow/wibta_for_asking_for_my_stuff_back/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I am the asshole, IDC. I am so annoyed. So I've been off work since Wednesday for Thanksgiving. My parents live like 5 minutes away. I went over their house Thursday. I went over their house Friday and today is Saturday and my mom is like, ""I'm picking you up and we'll go do this and that and this.""

We are currently still long distance, in different countries (Scotland and Japan). 

Due to strict Japanese entry requirements, I was unable to see him during the 2 years we were apart. He came to visit me in Scotland 8 months ago. 

Since Japan opened up, I was planning to come visit him in December. I asked him about it, and he seemed very stressed, and said he would not be able to take time off work, because his coworkers and boss would judge him. Not even one day. 

I did not mind that, considering my family/friend lives there, and said he wouldn’t need to take time off, since I wouldn’t be alone, and we could hang out in the evenings/on weekends. He agreed. 

I was unable to come due to unrelated reasons, and decided to visit later next year. 

A few days ago, he told me he took 2 days off in December to go on a trip with his friend, who lives nearby. I didn’t say anything, but I feel very hurt that he was more than happy to take time off for his friend who he sees frequently, but not for me.  

I asked my Japanese friend for advice, thinking it could be cultural difference. She told me that my boyfriend must be very stressed from work, and I would be a total asshole if I brought up I was unhappy, and that would totally ruin his trip. She said it was extremely minor, and I must be just looking for an excuse to pick a fight. 

Would I be an asshole if I ruined his trip by bringing up this topic?

I took an Uber to the location my car was only to find out that it didn't just break down, but the paint on the bumper was scratched, the back of the car was dented, the left break light was cracked and the trunk wouldn't close anymore, and of course the reason she called! it wouldn't start. I was beyond angry since I had only just gotten this car around last Friday. She told me it wasn't a big deal and that she accidentally backed into a car while leaving the store even though I knew she was lying. Backing into a car shouldn't cause it to stop working. I went crazy and started yelling at her, reminding her about how long it took for me to get that car and how much the repairs would drain my money especially since Christmas is coming. She told me that I was being a bad husband and that it was just a car, and that I should just deal with it. I ended up getting another Uber back home and left her behind which was a bad idea because it didn't stop her from mentioning it at Thanksgiving dinner. Yesterday she had gotten the bill for her own cars repairs (she got a tire change) and asked me to pay for it. It was about eight hundred dollars and I still have to pay for my car. I told her I wouldn't pay for it and she can find some other way to get it paid.

I was 20(f) and I had started talking to my ex 22(m) again after a year of being distant. 
We were ‘long distance’ although he said we weren’t in a relationship. We flirted, and confided in each other and I felt like things were more positive this time around. I was definitely more emotionally available to him and invested than he was to me. I was house sitting for a couple days in summer of 2020, I invited him over for a night and it felt great spending time together in the moment. We had sex but I wish we didn’t, the penetration was dry and felt like carpet burn inside me. Being emotionally intimate and other avenues of pleasure were more fun. Jeez. Anyways, my period was late by a day. So i told my mom for support, I did not want to be pregnant and I was so freaked out. Then, I sent him a text saying I thought I might be pregnant but I did not elaborate on my emotions. His response was “I’m moving in two weeks, I thought I was stressed out but this takes the cake.” 
He did not ask me how I felt about this once. Then I explained at some point I told my mom. And there was some miscommunication that led him
to believe I was lying and being manipulative. This fucking broke me. I had no ill-intent or any idea about baby trapping. I didn’t even want a kid, and still never want a kid. He continued to berate me even after the pregnancy test was negative. (that shit costed 30 dollars) Then he decided to call my mom? This part made me feel
humiliated. Because the vibe was he was trying to prove me wrong and get my own mother on his side.  My mom and my ex created a hurricane of drama over the phone for ten minutes. He was so
disrespectful to her while trying to “debunk my lying”.  My mom was having none of it, and it was just a mess. The most hurtful part of this whole thing for me was watching two people who I wanted to trust and be there for me during my stress, were so selfish about who was being right in that moment. I’m not sure what would’ve went down if I had actually been pregnant. I will never resolve this between me and my ex and I’ve been working on accepting the situation as it stands. However I still sit with the pain of him treating me like that. Even after this whole spat, he was still being mean like,”I have to keep track of when you’re lying.” and made me apologize for something i didn’t do (lie about whatever he thought i was lying about) replying in all caps “THANK YOU.” like it was obvious I was deceiving him in some way I just didn’t get it.  Even after bringing my mom into it I’m not sure what I said but he replied with “you’re 20.” as if i was being immature in some way. 
I felt this event was meant to happen. He showed his true colors here. 
I got my period the very next day.

When we got to our car, which I parallel parked on the side of a road, just behind a wide curve, found it with a side mirror hanging on for dear life and one of our blinking lights torn off. There also were some parts missing, so we couldn't have clued them back on and called it a day. Luckily there was a soaked piece of paper under the windshield whipper with a phone number and a name on it. We cancelled the painting course, because it's illegal to move the car in that state, took a bunch of pictures from the damage and parking situation and went inside.

We tried to call the number two times, each time unsuccessful. It was already late and we didn't really know what to do next, so we googled about what to do and later went to bed. 

The next day we called again and this time someone picked up. We said who we were and expected the other person to apologize and to give us his insurance. That turned out to not happen, he instead said to drive the car to a repair shop and said he'd split the bill 50/50.

A car mirror replacement and the scratches on our car would probably be in the thousands to fix. This guy accused us of parking our car there illegally. Which we didn't.

Afterwards I called my Mom, because you know ""mothers know best"" and she advised us to go to the police. So we got to our car again, asked some neighbors if they saw anything, took more pictures and called the police.

At first we were really scared that what the caller said was right and that we were in deep trouble. We got an ok to drive to the police station and reported the incident. They assured us that we did the right thing, affirmed that we we parking correctly and took our statements, which took several hours in total. 

We left afterwards and now have to pay the expenses out of our own pocket until they can find the person responsible for the damags, because we only had the last name and a phone number of the suspect.

Honestly we feel absolutely terrible, something like that never happened to us and the guy was quite intimidating. He called half an hour ago, apparently very angry. I don't know if my girlfriend picked up or not as I wasn't in the room when he called. 

We suspect that the guy drove in a company vehicle as the eye witnesses described a yellow truck with ""Fruits and vegetables something"" on it. We're worried that he might not have any insurance or that he'll maybe even get fired for the incident. We feel like such assholes and couldn't even revoke our charges if he cooperated, because it's illegal to drive away from a crash.

He would complain that I did not spend enough time with him, but was always negative and uncomfortable to be around. He encouraged me to get a girlfriend to encourage healing family relationships. I got a boyfriend (19) (for unrelated reasons) and now he has even more problems with me. I still don't like being around him, and now he places blame for it on my partner. The first interaction they had we explained to him my partner's pronouns and he ended up interrogating my boyfriend. He said his point was to 'help us understand each other,' but the conversation felt very attacking and made us feel like he just wanted us to accept that he wasn't going to accept us unless we conformed to his thinking. 

Regardless, my partner has been going to counseling for years before we met, and has tried to help me help heal my relationship with my father. One of the first direct attacks against my partner was when I got really sick and my partner needed to take me to the ER. I stayed at my partner's house as he and his family took care of me. I called my dad to ask if I could pay rent late since I could not drive at the time. At first he said he needed me to come home immediately. I told him I didn't feel safe over there and he said those were my partner's words, not mine. He said he would come get me, then asked why I thought he was being controlling. When I refused, he asked me if I had ever considered the idea that my partner was poisoning me. 

There have been more conflicts and confrontations, but most recently, my partner and I made an effort to show up for Thanksgiving dinner there. I had told him I worked till around 3, so he told everyone they'd start at 3 ? So, by the time we showed up he seemed already mad we were late. The only time he spoke to me was after I tried to greet him and he said ""Hurry up, I'm hungry."" My cousin gravitated toward my partner to introduce themselves and inform my partner that people had been discussing how confused they were about my partner's pronouns. My partner was uncomfortable, but tried to engage with the family and be kind anyway. My dad talked to me about it the next day and said he was really upset I brought my partner after he had asked me not to, but I don't recall him saying that. I only recall him telling me I needed to eat Turkey with them, since I've stopped eating meat and they had a surplus. He was upset I didn't eat their meat either. He tried making me feel bad, saying he doesn't think him or my partner will ""ever feel eye to eye,"" but it feels horrible to say that when my partner has good intentions and I don't think has done anything wrong.

He had a lot of mental health issues, and every issue he had he always came to me for resolution. Without fail, I would always be there for him more than anyone else, including his family when he was going through a rough time.

Recently, however, I started having doubts about the friendship. We are both part of a friend group that is quite small, and although I like everyone there I always felt a bit marginalised. I had a party a few weeks ago, and invited his girlfriend which he had been on a break with for about 2 months (i was also friends with her). He was at this point going through pretty bad mental health issues. I only did this because he said he wouldn’t be able to come due to having to take medication prescribed by his psychologist. As a result, I got torn apart by my friend group and called a bad friend, due to him going through a hard time (severe depression) and me inviting her was betraying him. I called him up after receiving a bunch of grief to be told that he didn’t care if I invited her (though he insulted me behind my back). So the party went ahead and I decided to reconsider my friendships, deciding to cut off 2 of the 4 guys (including the guy who’s girlfriend I invited). He showed up to the party despite his so-called ‘medication’.

I have started hanging out with some new people and recently invited some friends over to watch the football. I invited the 2 friends I like from the original group as well as some other people, and am trying to make it clear that I do not want to hang out with the other two without outright saying it (especially the one previously mentioned). He started asking about me inviting some people round and it’s obvious that he wants to come, and even got one of the guys I was mates with to ask why he wasn’t invited. AITA for cutting him off like that?

To summarise:
Reasons why I might be the asshole in my opinion- Cut him off at arguably his lowest point and have somewhat excluded him from social gatherings
Reasons why I might not be the asshole - Got burnt out from him emotionally dumping on me for a year and a half with nothing improving, as well as falling out with the friend group. Almost all people i know also agree he’s a very weird guy.

I am a lot happier now and the guy im trying to cut off is doing better as well now that he has broken up with his girlfriend.

For context, I have undiagnosed ADHD but I’m on a waiting list to get the diagnosis. She knows about my ADHD and is also neurodivergent, and we both have anxiety and depression.

I’ve always been the one to go and visit her, she’s not yet been to visit me. She told me she was going abroad for 2 weeks to see a friend who she met in the summer. This upset me bc she’s never made the effort to come and see me in her own country. I’ve planned for her to come to me a few times bu it always ended up with me going to her, which i didn’t mind even though I don’t drive but she does. And i will openly admit, and have done to her, that i got jealous. I took it out on her when she was excited and that was wrong, so i apologised and we moved on.

The next few weeks were rough for me, i have a lot of health and personal issues going on at the minute and November is not a good month for me due to past traumas. She was also coming up to the one year anniversary of a big trauma, which is awful and i’ve been there for her through it all. I never asked if she was okay bc i thought it obviously was not so what a stupid question.

I always wanted to have friends has im a INFJ-T personality trait.. I'm really introvert and lazy so having a friend already once i landed would have been a great start so i applyed to the uni buddy program.

I got paired with a F(23) that at the start looked alright. Around the end of the first month (september) is Uni festival period and brought her to meet the other foreigners i had the pleasure to meet as also it was her request to meet them. I went with the flow but at a point my introverersion and social insecurities starts to show up as im left alone while in group and im not even getting cared about. I use the excuse to use the bathroom and leave to my dorm room just to crawl inside my bed (it was 8-9pm and we started at 7pm.)

It took me 1 week of internalization to come up with the courage to open up to my buddy (Her) about my insecurites and social behaviours. She dismisses everything i say to her.. and we parted ways after being told to work out, buy new clothes and improve my daily routine. She even said that me wanting to be friends with her was impossible as i will make friends in class. I basically talked to a wall.

So gave her the chanche to redeem herself while i did what she said. Even there she dismisses my efforts. 

She kept giving me the cold shoulder untill last week when i was fed up on her behaviour of always take and never give. I climbed mountains for her like going out half drunk from my bed just to keep her company till 3am on a night i had to wake up at 7 for a class. Even then ungratefull behavior after also getting free food sample i dont like cause spicy.

So i decided to text her ask what went wrong between us, i was willingly trying to get constructive criticism but also wanting her to maybe look at her actions so we could both maybe reconcile and work out from there...

Well she went with"" i dont know why you are imagining things and accusing me of something i didn't do at all. You are straight up lying and im angry at you for accusing me of such bulshit, especcially  saying im narcissistic"". After this i had my final confirmation and sadly i got very mean with words like: 

""you have such high standards but you dont fill them yourself""

""You act friendly with everyone, but deep in your mind you dont care about anyone but yourself, maybe not even that if we count your behaviour while partying""

""Stop standing  in a throne that doesn't exist and start with your heart more""

I actually like it a lot. I enjoy spending time with family, relaxing away from work, exchanging presents, etc etc. But like many people I find some aspects of the holiday exhausting or at least annoying. The obsessive decorating, the music and some of the other rituals can get to be a bit much. The tendency for xmas stuff to start slipping earlier and earlier into November (and somehow even October now?) has only made it worse. It's not so bad when it's actually Christmas time, but you have to be in the mood for it, you know?


Years ago I started telling people it was bad luck to start celebrating Christmas before December. I started just saying it as a joke, but slowly realized that it kind of worked. There's so many different beliefs and traditions around the holidays that I guess it just sounded like something that could be ""true."" (True in this case meaning I didn't just make it up) I'm not obsessive or anything, but it has bought me a few carol free weeks, or delayed the inevitable Saturday afternoon on the roof hanging lights. Again to be clear I'm not badgering early celebrators or anything, just a comment her or there when the Mariah Carry gets to be unbearable or when I want to avoid watching a Christmas movie 2 weeks before December.


Anyway a few days ago, I said this to a family member and they mentioned that they had never heard anyone else say it. I explained that it's not really a traditional Christmas thing, it's just something I say. They got pretty upset that I had been lying to them. In my defense all superstitions are just something some guy made up. So I shouldn't be worse than anyone who says anything is good/bad luck.

I am an only child and my parents are still married. They are both in their 70s.

I have never had empathy or sympathy for my dad since his diagnosis. Why you might ask?

Because in my view my dad is an awful human. He forged my name on student loan documents to refinance them out of the fed for a lower interest rate, he also racked up 100,000 in credit card debt without my mom knowing pre-AOL. He forged my moms signature on a check to take 10,000 out of her (sole ownership) checking account to help pay down his credit card debt (which he ran back up again). He blames me for his 100,000 in credit card debt, saying it's my fault they have so much debt. He swore up, down, left and right that I would never have to pay for college expenses ""because he saved"", only to have the truth come out - he saved NOTHING and saddled me with the full cost after I initially thought I wouldn't be paying at all. He used to work for the DoD and got a DUI, only to have his supervisor get the charges dropped for ""national security reasons"". He has a drinking problem. He makes fun of me for being gay (and has since I came out in 2014) and now, in his demented state, he routinely makes racist comments. He routinely uses the N word and uses rude phrases to describe latinos in America.

Needless to say, my level of love for my dad is really low. However, my mom is in denial (they've been married 50+ years and she is now realizing she will spend her last days alone) and routinely calls me an awful person for not having sympathy for my dad now that he has dementia.

I don't go around abusing him or anything. I just don't feel sympathy for him at all.

While talking to my SIL, she suggested that we donate money to charity instead of giving each other gifts. While this is a great idea, it really rubbed me the wrong way.

He would rather give the money to his relatives and I completely agree with him.

We used to have a friend group with Theo and Mark (both m20s) but now Janet doesn’t speak with Mark and only associates with Theo in group settings. She had issues with Theo for months and cut off him off when he made a joke at her expense around a situation last year.

Mark is tactless and Janet is sensitive. It’s clear he doesn’t find her attractive and would let it slip so Janet extrapolated from this that he finds her “ugly.” 

Last weekend, everything blew up. Janet took an Irish history class which Theo asks her questions about it. We are all Nigerian Americans. Mark asked her why she cared more about white people than black people and Janet said he was insinuating she was self-hating. I think Mark was wrong for what he said but that Janet was wrong for putting words in his mouth. Since then, our quartet is dead.

My weekly DnD club has Theo and Janet as members. Janet is nice to Theo so he doesn’t know she dislikes him. I don’t expect her and him to blowup but I worry more drama would break out with other people.

So two nights ago I asked Janet if she was going to have any drama with other people. She was taken aback and had been avoiding me. 

I agree that she’s not entirely at fault for what happened but she isn’t blameless either. Janet did mention she had issues with things one person in our campaign says, specifically about her appearance and a conspiracy theory so I believe I was right to ask. I feel like she takes things too seriously and is overly sensitive.

AITA for questioning my friend in whether she would be involved in drama for our friend group because of the fallout if another?

Anyways, we spent the night hanging out with Chad, Brad, &amp; a few other guy friends of theirs. There was a live band (very loud) &amp; it was super crowded where we were standing, so there wasn’t a ton of conversation going on between all of us. It was fun &amp; the guys kept offering to get us drinks whenever ours were running low. We never asked them to get more, they just offered &amp; we said yes. They were super nice about it, not pushy or creepy. They ended up getting me about 4 or 5 drinks (wine) over the course of 2-3 hours. There was no flirting on my end, no physical contact, but I was being friendly &amp; dancing &amp; having fun. At one point he put his arm across my shoulders &amp; I immediately took it off. At some point later in the night, I mentioned that I have a boyfriend. I was drunk at this point &amp; wanted to make sure it was clear that I was not an available option. Brad, who was the primary one talking to me, was disappointed but fine with it. Chad, his friend, was a little more upset &amp; told me that I should’ve told them at the beginning before they bought us all those drinks. I reminded him that they never asked &amp; if they had, I happily would’ve told them. I said that if their primary purpose in buying a drink for a woman is to get laid, they should probably check that they’re single first. Their friend group (jokingly?) was like “oh she’s in a relationship, let’s go” &amp; acted like they were all gonna ditch us at this point. We ended up hanging out for a little longer, but a couple of the guys seemed really annoyed that I had a boyfriend &amp; hadn’t mentioned it right away.

I personally feel like it was their job to ask, especially as they weren’t being outwardly flirty when they initially approached us.

They just asked us to try our best and helped us/got tutors if we were struggling. It’s not as if Mia was forced to do the following.)

Last year, Mia would use Inspect Element to fake her online grades. She would tell our parents she was getting all A’s when she was actually failing most classes. Mia skipped most of her classes because she wanted to have fun off-campus. Mia only showed up for test days and would send an email using one of our parents’ email accounts to excuse her absence. Mia set notifications on her phone, so whenever the school sent an email about her failing/missing too much school, she would delete it/reply through their email accounts saying they handled it and a meeting wasn’t necessary. I explained to Mia why doing this was a bad idea because she can’t trick our parents forever and there’s no need to lie to them anyway. I said that I would not snitch on her but I would also not defend her if she kept doing this and got in trouble because she knows the consequences. A few weeks before the end of the year, Mia’s phone died at school and our parents logged onto their emails and agreed to a parent teacher meeting before she could delete the request email. They found out during the meeting about all the things Mia had been doing and that she would have to repeat her junior year because she missed too many days of school.

Our parents were super pissed off with Mia because she had been lying to them for almost a year. Especially after Mia would convince them to let her attend a Sunday concert or raise her allowance because “I have all A’s!” Our parents took away Mia’s allowance. They also sold Mia’s smartphone and gave her a very basic flip phone that she can only use for emergencies. They took away Mia’s car and give her rides to and from school because they don’t trust her anymore. Mia was complaining to me that her friends are all going to graduate together while she’ll spend her senior year alone. And our parents are such assholes for “not letting her do anything” when that’s already happening. Mia kept going when I asked her nicely to stop, so I told her “Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Mia. You got yourself into this situation by being lazy and dishonest. You knew the consequences and now they’ve arrived.” I also told her that she can join clubs next year and make friends that way. She won’t be without friends unless she chooses not to reach out and find some. Mia told my grandparents about what I told her, and they are saying that I was out of line. They said that everyone makes mistakes, especially as teenagers, and that Mia is already facing enough consequences. So I could have just said nothing instead of “rubbing salt in the wound” with my reply.

My parents have divorced my entire life, and my dad was the typical deadbeat that claimed to love their kid but then turned a blind eye whenever my mom needed help with tuition, supplies, clothes, etc. All he ever did was break promises and gaslight me, so I cut contact with him as much as I could.

Around HS one of my uncles (my dad is one of 3 brothers) passed away, he was also a deadbeat which I guess made my dad regretful because when I visited him for the holidays he told me he wanted me to have his apartment if anything happened to him, and I was happy to accept. 

Flash forward to 2021, my other uncle contacts me suddenly saying my dad is sick. He wanted me to see him again in case things got ugly, but I was extremely hesitant and conflicted. Deep down I still loved my dad, but I knew seeing him would only hurt me, and I realize now that I was also in denial. I kept trying to build up the courage to see him, especially when my uncle notified me the cancer was terminal. But still, I just couldn't. I still don't know whether or not I regret that.

My mom gave me the news of his passing around June, something she found out through a mutual friend because neither my uncle nor his mother notified us or let us go to the funeral. When I finally saw my dad's side of the family again my uncle said he would help with anything my dad left behind. I asked about the apartment, to which he said it was rightfully mine, but my dad wanted to put it up for rent and split the money 50/50 between me and his mom, however I only received 33% and the apt. was put in my grandma’s name, though she passed a few months ago.

Yesterday I asked my uncle if we could start the process of legally putting the apt. in my name so I could have the full rent money, to which he freaked out on me, started insulting me, and to never ask him that again because apparently my dad gave him instructions of what to do with that apartment and since I never bothered to visit him in his final moments, it's my fault I'm not involved in the legal process and he's not going to tell me anything. I'm deeply confused since before he had always said that he would do everything in his power to help me.

My mom and I have suspected foul play basically since the very beginning, but this was a complete 180º to how he acted towards me before and everything he said to me has made me lose pretty much all the progress I've made in therapy since my dad passed. Everyone around me tells me it is not my fault but I'm truly beginning to doubt it.

Reddit, am I the AH for expecting to receive my dad’s apartment even after I never visited him on his deathbed?

At the age of 6, I was diagnosed with epilepsy. No genetic predisposition that my family was aware of, it was literally out of nowhere. Growing up was a literal burden, on both my parents and myself. I've had 3 concussions from falls and more scrapes and bruises than I can count.
Last year, my 21f (now ex) boyfriend 20m and I got really serious. He brought up the topic of a family in the future. I told him I had no plan on having children.
Apparently, this wasn't the answer he was hoping for. He started prying me for answers why. I told him that epilepsy has a pretty high rate for being genetic (40%). I told him I never wanted to have a child who would suffer like I have.
Even with my explanation, he wasn't happy. He ended up telling his mother + sister, who already both disliked me, that I don't plan on having children. They both started berating me and telling me that if I wanted to be part of the family in the future I needed to do what I had to.
I told them it was honestly none of their business what I do with my body. They honestly didn't care and told me I didn't belong with him.
Arguments about our future are what generally caused our breakup, not to mention his horrid relatives who he blabs our personal business to. But I never forgot about this argument. It bothers me to this day.

My (F36) sister Janet (F32) has 3 kids: Maddie (F14), Noah (M10), and Nikki (F8). Janet had Maddie with her boyfriend, Mark. They hadn't been together long, but when Janet found out she was pregnant, they eloped.

For the first several years, their marriage was fine. However, it started getting rocky when Nikki was born because Janet became a SAHM, making Mark work more. It grew progressively more tense between them, to a point where they contemplated divorce.

Because of Nikki's age, Janet and Mark didn't want to divorce, and decided on counseling. They've been in it for a few years now, and their marriage has gotten better. Their counselor suggested a date every two weeks, so Janet will contact me asking she can drop her kids off at my place. They're well-behaved, so I have no problem watching them; typically, it will be after my work day is over.

This is where it's messy. Janet asked me if I could watch her kids for a whole week. Her 15th wedding anniversary with Mark is coming up, and they were planning a Florida trip. I only live 20 minutes away, so I was a convenient choice.

I'm a graphic designer and currently working on a large project for a client's baby shower, but I figured that it would still be okay to watch Janet's kids because they'll be in school most of the day, so I agreed.

Later on, Janet then asked if she could have their dog over, too. I said ""no"" because I'm highly allergic, have no space for a dog in addition to her 3 kids, and my husband and I both work full time, so we just can't occupy a dog. Janet seemed understanding, and told me she would look into kennels for her dog that week.

The day of their trip, they came over, and Janet handed me a leash with their dog, and gave my husband a bag of dog food. I pulled Janet aside, mentioning that I had explicitly said my husband and I were in no position to take care of a dog, and she shrugged it off, telling me that Noah was getting separation anxiety from their dog, so they ended up not looking into kennels. She then told me that her trip was important and she saw no reason why I couldn't ""put up with my allergies and put time aside for a dog when it's only one week"".

I reminded her that I was already taking on her children without getting paid, and now she was forcing the one thing upon me that I said I could not do. Janet rolled her eyes and then turned to leave, because they were going to miss their flight and had nowhere else to take the dog. I shoved the leash back in her hand and told her she could forget about her trip, then, because if she couldn't hold up her end of the bargain, I wouldn't either, so there was no need for her children to stay since she had to stay behind for the dog anyway. 

Long story short, she missed her flight, called me a huge asshole, and said I'm causing damage to her marriage because ""family would have helped out"". Her friends contacted me, also calling me an asshole.

I tried to encourage her to go but she didn’t want to unless I went too. His sister asked me if I would come too because she thought it would be more important to my ex for our daughter to be there than for me not to be.

I agreed to go after she said my ex would assume I kept our daughter from the dinner which would only cause more issues between us which we definitely don’t need. His sister explained why I was there when we arrived and while he didn’t say anything to me directly, she told me he was okay with it.

His family were all happy to see me but my ex’s girlfriend and her family weren’t. His girlfriend confronted me after dinner and asked me why I was there. Even though I explained why, she said I had ruined my ex’s birthday and that I had made it all about me and my pregnancy which made him uncomfortable and put him in an awkward position. She kept telling me I shouldn’t have come and she implied I had come on purpose to ruin his birthday.

She's relatively new to reddit and recently came to know that you can check anyone's activity - their posts, comments, and upvoted posts by knowing their username.


Naturally, I denied. Now, I don't really have anything really weird on my profile, just some cringe comments here and there. 


But it's not really about that. My reddit profile is something that I want to keep private. If she knows all my activity, I'll lose some amount of autonomy.
I'll always be wary of all my activities knowing that she will know about it.


I thought of a way out. I prepositioned her that I can trade my username for a video of her that she's really embarrassed about (immature af, ik). The idea seemed rock solid and she did send me the video. But it didn't really work out in the end and I didn't watch the video as it would be unfair to her.


After that she tried to make a deal that she would blow me without a condom (again, immature af, ik). I agreed. But right as I was about to give my username away, I figured, I'm not really bound to make any deal and I should be able to just say no, as I value my privacy more than a one-off pleasure.
 
I also feel a bit perplexed as I think that hiding stuff from her is wrong.

Also, I would like to clarify that we are pretty child-like and silly with each other and often make these stupid deals. We were laughing through this entire conversation. 
But this one actually got me thinking, what should the ideal situation look like and hence this post (with her consent).


Am I making too big a deal out of it? Or is it the girlfriend who's in the wrong here?

My parents are divorced since 5 years ago and i (m18) live with my father (m42) while my brother (m21) lives with my Mother (f38) Im still in School learning for the German Graduation(ABI) while getting pocket money from my father. My parents have their own oppinion where they think of themselves as the one who is in the right. 

I go once in a while to my mothers place to visit her and my brother. That was also the Case this Weekend because until the next exams there is more time then usual.
So to get back to the actual story, my brother drove me and him to a supermarket to buy groceries for home.
When he was taking a look at his Car wether everything is fine i saw a Man collecting those bottles to get enough money. So i took out a 10€ almost as much as 10$ and went quick to him(i was embarassed to look like a good person or hypocrite to my brother) to ask him wether he collects returnable bottles to keep sure i dont create a misunderstanding because of his looks.
We are not financially well off but we have enough to live comfortably and i earned some money myself so i thought instead i could help him with giving it to him so he doesnt has to have keep looking for bottles in the cold.
My brother saw me and told me how it was too much and that it was wrong. 
He kept making fun of me even after i explained myself with the reason that i could afford it because i earned a bit of money and he needed it more than i do.
We argued and he drove me to their home and drove somewhere
My mother came back shortly after it 
and from one topic to another she also heard it and told me how it was too much.
I told her from the few euros she gives away a month because she is outside often i just did give those euros together as 10€ away once the first time with this amount and i earned it myself. I dont want to be only thinking of myself everytime with money but also give as much as i dont need away instead of buying random stuff.

This is my first time posting i read the rules sorry for any mistake and english is not my first language as you can see.

I'm a mom of three kids and my oldest (nonbinary 18) recently came home for the first time since they went away to college. I was so excited to see them, but they wouldn't even let me hug them. They told me that it was a ""boundary"" they wanted to set because they don't like to be touched. I was floored. This is my kid, and not being able to hold them goes against my own boundaries. I tried explaining that it isn't fair to not let me hold them but they kept insisting that they don't owe me anything.

They went back to school yesterday after we had another fight about their nonsense rules. I couldn't even pat them on the shoulder as they got in their car. I was pretty annoyed with their attitude so I gave them the rest of the day to cool off. This morning I texted them, telling them that they hurt me. All they responded with was ""imagine how I feel as an adult who can't set boundaries"". Again with the boundaries? I was fed up so I told them that we're changing phone providers soon. they'll get kicked off the new plan since they obviously don't care about their own mother. They haven't talked to me since but my husband is saying that I'm going too far. He keeps saying that I'm being selfish even though my kid is basically leaching off of me.

I live in a dorm because it’s easier for me to get to my classes and I don’t have a great home life. 

As the weather changes, I am very susceptible to getting sick and as a result I had a sinus infection a couple weeks ago. The day I found out I had a sinus infection, my roommate started treating me like I was a reptile and would back away from me anytime I was near and anytime I reach near a doorknob she insists on touching it for me. This hurt my feelings and as a result I decided to gather some clothes and stay at a friends house till I felt better. My roommate however stated that though I left I still managed to get her sick. I don’t think I did get her sick since she goes out often, our room is freezing cold, and the weather is cold out but I still apologized to her if she felt like I did.

This has caused a drift between us and as a result she has been throwing shady comments my way. I always cover my mouth when I cough and she feels a need to always remind me to even when she watches me do so. 

During this thanksgiving break, I caught a cold from my little brother and notified my roommate that I was sick once again. She became angry and told me that I should leave our dorm because she didn’t want to get sick. I told her no and stated i paid to live in the dorm and I have no where else to go. She insists that I go back to my friends place or return to my parents but I said no. 

If she wants me to wear a face mask in my dorm and distance myself from her I can do that but leaving my dorm is out of the question for me.

My 26, female, sister moved in with me 29, female, and my husband 32, male, days ago after her divorce was finalized then lost her job and was no longer being able to pay rent for her apartment.


We're mostly in agreement about everything except, I've been kind of having an issue with what she wears especially at nighttime when she unwind and tend to relax a bit as she says. I think that what she wears is inappropriate. She usually wear silky nightwear (nightgowns mostly). She says that's just ""her style"" and is what she's been wearing for years. Not just that, but she'd come out of her room dressing like that to grab water or use the bathroom. While yes, it was just me who saw her dressed like that I honestly could not risk having an argument with my husband over it. I suggested she buys some pjs but she said that she doesn't ""feel comfortable"" in them.


Last night, I saw her in the kitchen grabbing something from the fridge and was dressed in a purple, strapped, knee length nightgown. I tried to speak to her about it but it didn't go well. We started arguing and I ended up telling her to stop leaving her room when she's wearing stuff like that and she argued that there was nothing wrong with what she was wearing, that it wasn't like she was walking around naked or anything of the sort. I told her it's my home and she's a guest and should just respect my request but she responded saying that just because she lives in my house does not mean that I have the right to control what she wears then stormed off to her room.
