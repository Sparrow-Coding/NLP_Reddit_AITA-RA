A few of her cousins, an uncle and her brother and SIL have been complaining about her and I leaving family events early, or being a bit checked out during those events. For context, she and I both started new jobs this year (same field) and bring a lot of work home with us, her more than I. Because of this she has been a bit preoccupied during these events and has had to leave a little early. I must say I also play a part in this, as I'm very introverted and long events drain me, and her family have LONG events and make it a competition around who can stay the longest, which Fiance thinks is normal and I think is a bit toxic.

Her mother (MIL) has relayed this to us, and her specifically, especially the complaints from her brother who is annoyed that we don't go to visit them more, and she ""isn't acting like a sister"". They however do not invite us over and don't exactly make Fiance feel very welcome. MIL has suggested that we just need to pop around every weekend or so to appease them, but we are both in the busiest part of our year and completely swamped over the weekends (especially with her family holding an event seemingly every fortnight.)

She wants to avoid drama and to sacrifice more of our free time to her family, where I have suggested that we let them learn to deal with it, this is going to be our lives going forward. Although apparently, I am an AH for suggesting that and she would do the same for my family (who wouldn't ask us to do that.) I like her family and don't want to upset them, but I feel like this is setting us up to be taken advantage of time-wise (especially with her brother and SIL expecting their first within the year.) Apparantly this is a big problem and fingers are being pointed at me.

I am a High School senior who is a band member. As such, i have to look after the band and make sure it is a safe place for all the band members. 
Now there's a certain freshman Ill call karen. They are very stubborn when it comes to their opinion and always being in the right, whether that be good or bad.
 Now both of us are very invested in music, and use it as an escape from people.

Now, for the day it all goes wrong. 
Thanksgiving day, around 6:30pm, Karen decides to go after someone in the band group chat. Now, this kid, who ill call Logan, was spamming the chat, but not without good reason. For his sake, ill just say his home life isn't the best. Now, Karen starts to go after them for talking in the chat, and to be fair, everyone had enough, as this wasn't the first time. Then she says the magic words, ""you should just disappear forever."" 
Now this, this ignited a fire. So now, everyone in this chat is insulting her, with me leading the mob. I end up in a 2 hour argument with this person that ends with them threatening me with physical assault and blocking me.

Its been a couple days, they have appeared in school alright, but have yet to try and start something with me, but they have stopped coming to band class, but i feel no remorse as they've had t coming for a while.

So here are the basics. My little sister is a brat that demands to be the center of attention.  She is significantly younger than myself and my older brothers. Eleven years to be specific.  She is younger than a couple of my nephews. 

Her and her boyfriend wanted to announce their engagement and pregnancy at my wedding.  I said no.  They said it was the last time the family would be together.  I said no.  

They tried everything to convince me.  They got our parents involved. I said no. 

At the wedding they were specifically banned from the microphone. They tried to get to it a few times.  We tried to make it look like a silly game.  

I finally got sick of it and went to the microphone. I announced their pregnancy and engagement.  Then I congratulated them and led a round of applause. For them, not for me.  

She ran outside crying and my mom went with her.  

So now my sister is calling me a bitch for stealing her moment and my mom thinks that I over reacted to my sister wanting to share her news with the family.  A lot of my family is saying that if I was going to announce it anyway then I should have let her do it. 

Not that it matter but my husband and I paid for our own wedding with no contributions from my parents.

We were all in our first year in college. Our dorm was a “suite style” meaning there were two bedrooms, and two girls to a room. My roommate, Oakley, and my two suite mates Anna and Ashley. None of us knew each other before we got to school. Unfortunately Anna and Ashley could not live well together, one needed absolute quiet to go to sleep, one needed sleep sounds and they could not come to any kind of agreement. One time I got the RA to break up a screaming match at 12pm between Ashley who needed to sleep for her 8 am, and Anna who would not get off the phone in their room even tho it was 2 hrs after our rooms curfew. The RAs said one should move to a different dorm but neither were willing to leave, but Anna would sleep in our common space for weeks at a time. We straight up asked her why it wouldn’t be easier for her to just move, but she said she didn’t want to.
One day Ashley said her friend group had drama and they were cutting her off because of what Anna had told them. She told me that Anna had been talking badly about Oakley and I on the phone in front of us in Hindi which Oakley and I didn’t understand and Ashley did. To refer to us, she would say translated “Fatso and the other one”. She would also speak negatively about bodies(we were both larger than Anna) After this weeks went by of us trying to ignore anymore drama and Anna got worse.. She would not pull her weight when cleaning the dorm, she didn’t talk to any of us, she ignored us when we tried to have a dorm discussion, and we were so tired of it.
Now the actual AITA inquiry: I came home one day to Ashley crying. I asked what was wrong and she told me that Anna had texted Ashely’s boyfriend, who was still in India, whom she had never met, that Ashley was with a guy her boyfriend didn’t like alone in their room with the door closed, implying that she was doing something wrong when we were all very aware Ashley and her male friend were JUST FRIENDS as they both were in separate romantic relationships. I was so tired of all of Anna’s BS and silently hoping for her to move out that I wrote on our communal bathroom mirror: “Anna, stay out of other peoples business and please move out. This isn’t ok, everything would be better if we parted ways.” I returned later that night and the message had been erased. I rewrote it and the next day i found out that Anna had requested a room change.

As we had kids I went from being husband to dad and 3rd, then 4th priority.  Kids came first then her needs and lastly anything I needed or wanted.  She managed the house, cooking, care of kids and I worked whatever necessary to earn enough for the family.

Then 10 years ago her kidneys failed and she needed dialysis.  Being a loving partner I took classes at night to provide home dialysis.  I still had to provide and worked during the day and then at night did her treatments until she could get a transplant.  This was a constant burden that kept me from anything else in life as I had to also keep up the housework as she was exhausted from treatments. 

She got a transplant 3 years ago and kids have moved out.  So my life should have gotten easier.  No more treatments, kids no longer needing her constant attention.  However, instead she feels I have been doing great with housework and should keep 50% of it (laundry, unloading dishwasher, sweeping floors, bathrooms and windows).  And she got cats and getting closer with her family.  So I still have no free time between working 60+ hours a week and housework and general maintenance on house and cars.

Then this week I had to travel for work and had not slept in 2 days and asked her to help me stay awake on drive home.  She ignored me so she could talk to her mom.  I about drove off road as she ignored my calls.  When I got home I ignored her and slept in my office and looking for a new bed, she being upset for me not being more understanding.

I got to the bar before he did and then also waited about 20 mins at the bar for him. It was well past 7 p.m. at that point, but he stayed until 10 with me, despite saying he needs to go by 7:30 p.m. I was in a terrible mood all night and told him having made me wait all this time was really rude, so while I don't want to be mad, I can't help it. He denied there was anything wrong with the way he acted, said he just got held up at work and couldn't message me until after 6, what's the big deal. I said it was disrespectful, he said ""I'm actually a very respectful person, that's not true"".

In short - I (24M) met this girl (24F) recently through mutual work friends and we immediately hit it off, and have been on a few dates. I think she's beautiful, and I've never met anyone like her. I genuinely think she could be the one.

We didn't know each other growing up, but we're from the same part of the city, and I went to school with her older brother - she did not attend that school. Although her brother (25M) was not a bully of sorts, every time we crossed paths - whether at a football game or at a local battle of the bands, I've always hated how he gets a free pass for being good looking, charming, popular, etc. 

I always felt like he got promoted too easily in sports against the needs of the team because teachers and coaches loved him when his football skills are mediocre at best, and I'm not even a huge football guy. I have friends who feel the same way - like friends who were theater kids at school and always resented him for getting all the leading roles while having little musical or acting talent etc. 

He never gloated about his successes, but he wasn't exactly saintly and never really did anything exceptional or charitable towards the less popular kids. I was never that into school stuff and was pretty average socially, but I thought it was weird when he won class president purely because people thought he was cool, even if he never interacted with them.

I have seen him quite frequently over the years as we are both very into the music scene in the city and he seems like he could be a real rising star, with pretty packed concerts and an impressive social media following.

Generally, I just keep myself to myself and I just concentrate on my own music and art - except about six years ago at 18, when I tweeted a rant about how this guy was a mediocre asshole who didn't deserve his successes in music and sports etc. A few other people in the same social circles liked the tweet and nothing came of it.

Somehow, the girl I'm seeing saw the old tweets and is really upset. Although she was never popular like him and was kind of nerdy by her accounts, she and her brother are super close and he's like a hero to her. I don't feel that strongly about this guy now, and family is important to me too, so I understand why she's upset. However, it was a long time ago and it's not like he's my nemesis or anything. If I knew this amazing girl then I would never have said it.

I (20f) met, let’s call her Maple (21f) about a year and a half ago. I met her now ex (20m) let’s call him Ryan soon after, and we got along really well. He and I were good friends. 
When they broke up, she wanted him to stay friends with me. Personally, I was ready to hate him, girl code and such, but it was nice to still have him as a friend— I thought. Her one request: don’t fuck him. Easy, I had no attraction to this man.
Well she moved on from him, and while he’s made progress in his personal life, he’s been lonely. He wanted to hang out, and I agreed. Things got weird.
I don’t want to focus heavily on this, but for background info: I’ve got a weird history with men such that if one touches me in any way that I perceive as a sexual advance, I go on what I call autopilot. Basically, my body will go along with whatever the other person wants no matter what I may feel. It’s like a possum playing dead. If someone asks me if I want something, it’s rare that I can actually say “no”; more often I just stare at the person until they decide to stop or to carry on with me. The whole autopilot response is super inconvenient and leads to a lot of grey area situations where no one is wholly blameless or at fault when things occur that I didn’t want. It’s just messy.
Well when we hung out, he wanted to hold me. I was uncomfortable, but autopilot was engaged. I can’t blame everything I do on trauma though, and things progressed and I’m not proud of what all I did. We’d agreed to pretend it never happened, and that it would never happen again. 
After some long talks about my autopilot, what it was, where it came from, etc., and the position I would be in with Maple, it seemed we were on the same page, so a couple weeks later, I felt comfortable with hanging out with him again. Well, he did things to set off my autopilot again, but this time he took things further. This time, I fully shut down. I haven’t spoken a word except to 2 people since seeing him. Personally, I felt betrayed. I allowed everything that happened, but he knew about the autopilots and the shut downs. Hell, last time, he’d watched me shake and cry because of something that set me off— he knew that I was tricky. I know there’s a whole other side though; when autopilot is set off, my body acts as if it wants everything. If he only listened to my body, then he received many yes’s and acted accordingly. 
I don’t know— but he forgot his glasses here and wants to meet up with me to get them back though, and I’ve been avoiding him. I’ll have a friend return them, or I’ll mail them, but I do not want to see him anymore. Thinking about him feels gross, but he’s insisting we meet. Maybe he wants to understand wtf happened?

We have a really great dynamic, and we consider each other friends.

Emily had recently went through a rocky break up with her ex of 3+ years. Within the same week Emily started talking to an older guy, Adam, she had met on campus. Emily has made frequent mentions that she can imagine her and Adam getting married in the future. At the same time, she's still talking about her ex, and will make references to him randomly when she's sad.

We got into an argument not too long about about her new relationship with Adam, as she's been secretive about her past with her ex. I told her that this is unhealthy as she's still hung up over her ex, and Emily retorted that it wasn't any of my business. I ended up dropping the subject. Im also pretty vocal when she asks me for romance advice, as I don't approve of their relationship since Adam is older (29).

Recently though, she's been spending every night at Adams place. The current dilemma is that she occasionally asks me to put my ringer on while I sleep in case she needs an emergency ride home from his house. This is fine, but she will randomly send me texts in the middle of the night that wake me up to ""double check that my ringers on."" 

Alongside this, when she comes back to the dorm from his place to change, she does it early in the morning, and will wake me up in the process. If this was accidental, I wouldn't mind, but she purposely starts talking to me to wake me up to have a conversation about how her night with Adam was. Emily will also randomly say details about their ""night"" that make me uncomfortable.

I've also lightly mentioned to her that sleeping isn't the same without her in the room, and that I've been having difficulties finding rest due to that on top of her waking me up randomly. This is something we've discussed before, as we've both said that we tend to have troubles sleeping when the other isn't in the room. Emily laughs me off though, and calls me cute for wanting her to be in the room with me, so I also don't push the topic.

Here's why I might be an asshole. I know she's genuinely excited about her new boyfriend, and I know she just wants to let me know as soon as possible. Also, when she does wake me up, she does it on days when she knows I can sleep in, as my classes don't start until the late evening. She also apologizes when she goes into specifics with Adam and notices me getting uncomfortable. With the ringer situation, she said that she's dealt with situations before where her friends will say they turned their ringers on for if she had an emergency, but won't actually, and she wanted to make sure that I was being truthful.

She's was of the only ones offering every day service so when she asked if she could bring her two pet dogs I decided to let it slide. 

She's with us from 8am to 6pm everyday so the dogs don't really need to use the yard to poop, but if on the odd occasion they did I think she cleans it up because I don't find it on my lawn. One is a labrador and one is a German Shepherd so they both shed which is annoying but I tolerate it because she's a lifesaver.

Thing is, I got back yesterday and she was out with the kid at the shops picking up milk and bread like I asked. The dogs were in the house (which I wasn't thrilled about) but what alarmed me more was that after they ran to the door to bark at me, the labrador ran back to the living room and lifted it's leg and started peeing on the Christmas tree. We only bought it and put it up yesterday so I was really annoyed.

When the nanny came back I told her that her dog had been peeing inside, and she assured me that it was just because the tree is new and its never happened before. I told her that it's probably likely the dogs have peed and pooped inside before. She told me I was overreacting and offered to pay for cleaning. I feel like her telling me I'm overreacting is unfair because it's pretty likely if her dog peed once it's probably done it hundreds of times.

So I (30female) have never had a great relationship with my dad or his wife. For a little background he met my (step mom) when I was 12 she was nice at first but it didn’t take long for me to realize she was not a nice person. After years of her abuse I turned into an angry teenager and I absolutely hated her. Now that I am an adult we have put the past behind us (well at least I try) she brings past things up all the time. I have never held her horrible behavior towards me against her. (she was physically and mentally abusive) my dad has a very non existent relationship with me and my 3 children. I have tried for years to be close with him but he is not interested.

  For my 20 week scan I asked him a month in advance if he would watch my two kids (8y boy) (4y girl) my dad has only watched my kids a few times before and rarely sees them. (he sees her 4y grandson almost every weekend and watches him and takes him fishing)

He agreed to watch them for a few hours while me and my husband go to our dr appointment. I reminded him 3 times. He agreed all three times that he was still watching them. The day before my appointment I called my dad to just make sure he knew the time I was drop them off. And to my surprise he told me they would be camping and could not watch my kids. I was shocked and very upset. He didn’t apologize and just acted like he didn’t understand why I was upset that he forgot. His wife deleted me from Facebook. She has a habit of doing this for no reason so I ignored it. 

6 months later I invited them to my kids birthday party. My dad showed up but said his wife had to work.  

 Beginning of November my dad called me to tell me they were moving across the country at the end of the month and I asked him multiple times to pick a day to spend with my kids so they could say goodbye to them. My dads wife calls me out of the blue and asked if we could get together to “clear the air” and if she could see my kids.I responded that I don’t even know why she is mad in the first place and I dont have anything to clear up. She hangs up on me. I called my dad to see why she is mad and he tells me I didn’t invite her to my kids birthday party because I texted him about the party and not her.

I told my dad I did invite her and that this is absurd.  He requested I call her and set a time for her to see my kids and to take pictures of them. I said no. My dad never called to see my kids….

On Saturday, I sold a smartphone for the first time as a cash deal. I advertised it as like new condition and unlocked, which were both extremely accurrate. I sold it to someone for $80.

They informed me they were getting an error message saying to contact Verizon to unlock the phone. I contacted Verizon first thing in the morning and after a few hours being volleyed back and forth between departments and escalating my issue all the way up the technical support chain they assured me the specific device was unlocked. I then contacted the buyer's mobile provider to confirm the device was unlocked to them.

They said the buyer needs to call T-mobile to activate the phone, a step they had not tried. I suggested this to the buyer and they went to a T-mobile store and activated the phone that way. They then presented me with a new error message, which I researched to be a network settings or SIM card error and presented the buyer with my findings as well as a few helpful links that propose solutions to change their settings.

The buyer came back to me saying that they went to T-mobile and Verizon and both said the device was locked. The issue is I know this cannot be completely true, as I have documented conversations saying the phone is unlocked. 

At this point (now three days after purchase) they asked for a trade back. I said that because I went through the legwork on the phone to ensure the phone was not unlocked and therefore not misrepresented in the sale from my end (if it inadvertently misrepresented I'd take it back immediately, of course) and asked if they could try additional troubleshooting with T-mobile since it does seem like a settings issue on their end rather than my end.

I didn't hear back for over a day and then the buyer informed me they tried my solutions all day (I sent a 3 minute video of things to try) to no avail.

I have no desire to screw this person over over $80. My concern having been on the bad end of some Facebook scams is that something feels fishy here based on them insisting the phone was locked when it clearly was not and saying they tried my 3-minute solution all day. I believe that having not misrepresented the item for sale and that the deal was cash I have no obligation to go through with a refund because they are experiencing difficulties on their end, but I also feel bad about that.

I am the ""tie-breaking"" parent per the papers in the event we don't agree on an issue.
About a year ago I found out my oldest (ten) had a cell phone. It was only used when at his mom's house, and he had it almost a year when I found out about it. 
About five to six months later his mom calls me and insist that I have a talk with him. Apparently he was texting a friend and they mentioned a girl in the conversation. His mom was flipping out about how he needed to be talked to. 
My response was two-fold.
One: I told her in my opinion he was too young to have unrestricted access to a cellphone to call or text whoever. 
Two: I would gladly help parent the situation, but I think if I'm going to be asked to help parent something I knew nothing about, it seems reasonable to me that I should have equal parental access to the device.
She agreed but said the device had no parental controls or oversight, and she said she had looked and no such phone existed. After a five minute google search I found several companies that offered phones for kids that gave parents different levels of control and oversight. I sent them to her and asked if she'd be on board with getting one of these (we share cost on all joint things like this). She said yes and she'd let me know which one she chose.
A month goes by and no word so I asked her about her selection. She says that her and her fiancé had discussed it and they didn't think us having shared access was a good idea and my son was just going to keep the phone he has.
His birthday was last week and his stepmother and I bought him one of the cellphones I mentioned earlier with the parental controls. He loved it, and we had a good talk about responsible use and what was and wasn't allowed. I also showed him all the numbers I had ore-programmed into the phone including his mom's number. 
They went back to her this Friday and within a couple of hours I got a scathing text about how irresponsible it was to put a cellphone in the hands of an eleven year old, how I was opening him up to porn and predators and all kinds of dangers that he wasn't ready for yet. She also demanded I send her the number and that she needed to have the same level of access to the parent portal for the phone as I have. 
My response was to send her a screenshot of her text to me where she said her and her fiancé had discussed it and didn't think us having shared access was a good idea. I also explained that it was one of the phones with parental restrictions.
She went into a tantrum and gave me an ultimatum. She said if she didn't get access by Wednesday of this coming week, she would tell our son how I was keeping her from communicating with him and that I wasn't sharing access like a good parent because I am a control freak. 
I basically told her to go for it, but as much as it makes me mad that she is being a massive hypocrite here...I'm not sure if I was an asshole or not.",True,True,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4839762,public,top,spoiler,AITA for not sharing access to my son's cellphone with his mother?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8jtxk/aita_for_not_sharing_access_to_my_sons_cellphone/,all_ads,6,

While I do not need to talk with him or coordinate at all to do my job, I do see him multiple times every single day. 

When John was hired he approached everyone and personally told them he has autism and that he might need extra help to understand things. He likes to talk to everyone even outside his department but he apologizes after every conversation when it's never needed. He is very cautious not to offend anyone. 

John is the sweetest guy and I really enjoyed talking to him at first. He loves his job and talks about how it's the best in the world. He struggles with depression which he is very open about but always seems so happy and always tries to make everyone smile. His laugh is infections. Honestly he is so sweet he brings in gifts for people, asks them about their weekends and is a bright light at work. He never passes me without saying hello and trying to talk to me. 

The problem is a few weeks ago my coworker (F 30) greeted him in the morning by lightly touching his arm to get his attention and asked about his day. He was instantly very stiff, didn't acknowledge her and ran straight to HR claiming she had hit him. She got pulled in and statements were taken from everyone present. She kept her job only because she had a witness. 

My manager announced that from now on if we speak with or interact with John we all need to have a witness and if we don't we need to report the interaction to a supervisor. John grew cold towards my whole team. He wouldn't say hi or greet us anymore and only talked to us through his department coworkers. I could hear his laugh but when one of us came around the corner he'd stop and turn away pretending we weren't there. This change made me sad but I got used to it. 

Suddenly one day he returns to work claiming he is all better the problem has passed and we no longer need witnesses to speak with him. Literally everyone went back to normal. 

But I feel uncomfortable speaking to him especially if we're alone. I keep reporting my solo interactions to management but they say it's not needed anymore. I asked what changed and they said that John said he was good now, so we're good. I feel bad, I don't want to shun him but I always don't want to risk my dream job with great pay if he has another episode and deems me the perpetrator.

 All my coworkers think I'm small minded to cut him off over one incident. I'm still polite and if other people are around I will engage some but not as enthusiastic as before and certainly never in private anymore. I simply tell him it's a bad time or I can't talk when he tries to speak with me alone.

Here is the issue, they always post about how they love our dad and how they see him all the time he’s a great pillar for them to stand on yada yada. I just feel bitter like I could never have the same thing with him because of how he treated my mother. I see him a total of 4 times a year and it really hurts knowing my brothers and sisters get to see him damn near everyday. 
I know he deserves happiness but don’t I like how come they get to see him and have him all the time. How come they can post about how much they appreciate him. When I barely have had this experience. When they say that they love him all I can think of is all the times he was supposed to come get me so I can stay for for my weekend and he just didn’t show up to the point where I don’t even go over there anymore.

Last year Halloween I(19m) met a girl (19f) through a friend and we became close friends. After a few weeks I asked her if she wanted to date. She said no, so I dropped it. For some reason the conversation came up again a few days later and she said yes. It was going pretty well, a little more arguing than I would have liked. Most arguments were about me not doing something or whatnot. Some where true but others didn’t call for arguments. 

When we left for summer break and went online, things didn’t go well. We had a fight where I stood my ground for the first time. It ended with her saying “you just lost your girlfriend. How are you going to win her back?” And me saying “no. You don’t play these games with me. If you want to break up then break up.” And so we did. We didn’t talk until later that summer where some texts were exchanged about next year and moving on. She called me once over the summer to tell me that she hooked up with a guy. Didn’t really know what to do with that. 

We made the stupid choice to live very close for the next year so I wanted to mend our friendship or the year would be tough. When we went back to school we started hanging out more and more, but I told her it was strictly platonic. But looking back it wasn’t, it wasn’t like we were dating but somewhere in the middle. Like f-buddies without the f. I should have stopped it sooner. One day she asked me to date her again. I said I don’t know and I wanted some time to think and ask my therapist what he thinks. He helps me get my thoughts out. He said I should be confident I won’t make the same mistakes. I ended up saying yes. But for the next 2 days I had an uneasy and confusing feeling. So I told her what I was feeling. She said take sometime to think and get back to me. It took me 4 hours to realize I made a mistake. So not wanting to lead her on or waste her time.

Our arrangement is I pay for the mortgage and she pays for all the other bills and groceries. I have a full time job where I have to go into the office. Her business doesn't require her to be physically there so she's at home all day. Hence I expect her to do most of the chores (cleaning, cooking) since she's the one that's at home. 

She was cooking in the kitchen one day and it made the whole house very smokey so I made a comment to her about it. Her solution was to start cooking on a portable stovetop in the garage. 

A few days ago she started cooking a bunch of stuff to leave in the fridge for me since she was going to be gone for a week. She forgot the stovetop and pan outside and asked me to bring it in to wash. When I went to grab it I noticed oil stains on the garage wall and on my car. I told her to stop cooking in the garage because it was getting oil everywhere and that she can cook in the backyard instead.

She got all upset claiming I care more about the garage and the car then her and that it was too cold to cook outside and that she didn't want to cook on the floor. I told her to put on a jacket and bring a box outside.  She's now mad at me and accusing me of being unappreciative and not valuing her. No one asked her to cook a weeks worth of food for me I'm capable of fending for myself.

She hasn't spoken to me for 2 days saying I'm ungrateful. I really don't see the big deal. I bought a brand new house, my first house too, and I want to take care of it.

One of my neighbors is complaining that my cats are pooping in her plants and burning them with their waste. We live in a fourplex, we both rent to my brother (my brother owns the building). Her plants are in the front garden and yes, my cats go play there and do their thing. 

She stopped me while I was on a run yesterday and told me to stop my cats from pooping there and I said that I wish I could but I can’t control what the cats do. She told me “well you have to fix this, you have too many cats”.

I answered by telling her “ma’am just be happy and enjoy life”. She answered yelling at me that she was happy and I told her “be happy ma’am, just be happy!” while I walked away.

I told her the “be happy” thing because she is ALWAYS in a bad mood. A few days ago she was rude to my other neighbors grandkids and told her to tell her grandchildren not to play in the garden. I told the grandma that her grandkids could play there all they want that the rude neighbor doesn’t own the place and my brother does.

We all would hang out all the time and were super close. I was friends with each girl indivisually before I introduced all of them together. It was all fine and we were all getting along super well. Until one day, Ava contacts me telling me that she's having trouble eating and that she sees herself as fat. I try to cheer her up by telling her that she wasn't fat and that weight doesn't even matter as long as you're healthy. I don't know what happened but she tells Caitlin that I called her fat. 

Caitlin then decided to jump onto the bandwagon and say I called her a gorilla to Megan. Megan contacted me saying that she loves me but what i said to Ava and Caitlin was just wrong. I had no idea what she was talking about, so she explained everything Caitlin and Ava told her. I told her that I never actually said that and by that point I was furious that they would make up lies about me and just for the fun of it.

I decided to ignore it as a miscommunication, that is until we were all having a sleepover at Caitlin's house and while I was getting changed into my pjs they decided to record me changing and send it to random people in their contacts list. Megan found the video and showed it to me, and I was fuming, embarrassed and ashamed. I have always had rather big boobs for my age and people constantly remind me of that. I became absolutely livid when all the replies to the video were disgusting, saying I had a nice body and just really innapropriate things.

I snapped, I yelled at them both, telling them that they're awful people and that I did nothing to do deserve this. I called them both selfish and female dogs. I locked myself in the bathroom and called my Mum to pick me up. On the way home I cried in the car telling my Mum about what had happened. 

When I got home Megan had sent me many messages asking if I was ok, and Ava and Caitlin's parents had called my Mum saying that I did something that I didn't (Ava and Caitling were lying about me again). I have been ignoring all the mean messages Ava and Caitlin have been sending me, but Megan and I are still friends.

I love my little cousins, but I hate taking care of kids and don't plan on having any. Being around kids is very overstimulating as I'm on the spectrum. However that being said, I do my absolute very best to make sure that they don't know that and love them and care for them when needed. But something recently happened that made me question if I'm being an asshole. 


The event in question was one day when my cousin dropped them off. Things were going well until I told 6f she couldn't have a poptart until after the episode of her show ended since she had just eaten and kids are like that. I will note she is also on the spectrum, but she got very upset with me and ran to get the poptart anyway. When she got back she then asked me to open it and I told her no she still had to wait and kept it until the end of the episode. She usually would put up more of a fight but she just quietly waited and took it which made me think I was too harsh. 

Another thing is, the kids have a gazillion questions and after a certain point, I just got so sick of it and stopped answering after the second ""why"" or random question! My tipping point was being asked why my dog is black, I just dont know. I also declined to play hide and seek which seemed to upset them but I don't know if its poor babysitter etiquette to not want to get roped into a game. 


I asked my mom what she thought later (she works from home and witnessed everything) and she just laughed and said its funny how I always feel bad in a joking way and would not clarify which made me more concerned I went overboard.

During pandemic I befriend a guy from our school (Ray M21). One day he had the idea to get really drunk just for laughs. We went to a port, got drunk, and told me to go sleep in a hotel so I agreed. We realize when couldn't afford an Hotel, so he told me to go to a ""Couples hotel"". I never went to one and didn't know what it was until he explained to me. I agreed because we were going to sleep, i was really really tired and drunk so I feel asleep instantly. I texted my boyfriend about it because I thought it was funny! But he was hurt. I have autism so sometimes I don't really get why something is bad. He stopped talking to me for a month. I was really sad, crying all day, and Ray came to my house and comforted me. He told me to break up with my boyfriend. I told him I wasn't gonna do it because I love Max. He stayed the night. The next day when we woke up I don't know why but we kissed. To be honest I don't remember much of that day. The next day my boyfriend told me he wanted to talk, he explained why he felt the way he did, I understood and was happy he accepted my apologies. Ray on the other hand was insisting in still be friends but he invited me over to his house and touched me, and I did the same. Now we were seeing each other often as he leaves a block away from my house. I cried every night and was hoping that my boyfriend found out and told him to leave me alone, even if it was my fault too, i just wanted to be protected. (I was S/Ad as a child, and after that I used to search attention of grown man on the internet) It was difficult to tell my boyfriend about it, everytime I had the opportunity to tell him I went non verbal. Ray told me we couldn't keep this in secret anymore and pressured me into telling my boyfriend about it too. I tried to avoid speaking, messaging, or seeing Ray again. I needed to think. a month passed and I stopped talking completely to Ray. No more anything. So he went to my boyfriend's work, and told him about it. Ray told Max a twisted story of the events. He called me and asked me if it was true, I said it was but I wanted to explain myself as it wasn't all true! I went to were they were and had a full meltdown. Couldn't talk. I couldn't see Ray in the face as I was about to puke. Max walked me to my home and I started hurting myself in the middle of the street. Max stopped me. The next day I went to a cafe with max and explained myself, of course he was really hurt by my actions and I understood. He said he couldn't keep going without me and forgave me as he understood my story. Even though he forgave me, all my group friend did not, because Ray told them the story.

I guess quick synopsis. I've been working the past 6 yrs at a job I hated to make sure fam was provided for, especially through the pandemic. 

Earlier this year I called  my wife out on how she's been treating me like garbage and piling expectations on me. The short story is she's been using her depression as an excuse to not pay attention to me, rarely contribute to chores, not be engaged with our young kiddo. All she heard was that I really wasn't feeling it with her rn/wasn't her biggest fan atm. Thinking she'd handle it like an adult, I was blunt and honest. Wrong,  she left me and the kiddo for a week alone and went to her parents. 

Fast forward a few months(that all happened in the middle of the year), we've had good counseling and I thought in a much better place after being ""separated"" in the same home. I have a new, and DREAM job that has doubled my salary. 

However in the last month or so I've felt a sharp regression in our progress. She's taken a more ""active"" role at home and dropped from part time to as needed with her job. My salary can/should more than cover our expenses. I'm putting in a hair more time at work than the last place. She views it as much more since I gave up caring at the last job, in at 8am, out at 5pm don't care what's happening. I've cut my commute down from 1.5hrs to ~ .5hrs, but am still the villain if I work past 430pm and get home between 5-530.

Sorry I could go on forever with details, but I feel like I'm giving beyond myself to provide for fam, spend quality time when home, and still work on the mountain of house chores/repairs/etc. Forgive me if this is more appropriate for the AITAH thread. She ragged on me tonight for my decision making and said she honestly can't trust my choices right now. I really don't know what else I can do. I try to include her in all major decisions, but it's usually ""I don't feel like talking about it right now"", and then later, after calling the shot myself,  ""why the hell didn't you talk to me about this?!"". 

I really am at my wits end. I love my kid more than life itself and want his mom to be in his life. But I can't imagine how much of a relief it would be to have a spouse that is concerned for you and also show compassion instead of  criticism....

Idk what I'm asking at this point. It's late and the bourbon is helping me chill out.


TLDR: I've done 90% of the work in our marriage for 10yrs. Wife still acts like I'm not doing enough. Don't want to call it quits, but I'm dying.

I try to work around this and I go into the office sometimes, but it hasn't helped. I am looking for advice or solutions that have helped you.

My partner and I (early 30s) have lived together for about 18 months. We are both independent introverts who love one another, but also have a strong need for alone time. I love my job - I just started working 3 days a week (used to be 4, but I get the same pay!), and I get to choose where I work. We have a coworking space that's about a 40 minute bus/walk from our place, which is generally only frequented by a few coworkers; the rest are either fully remote, or only go in once a month or so. I prefer WFH due to the comfort (my desk set up is better and I can wear comfier clothes); because my days are longer; because it costs less money; and because I find myself very drained in the office. I also spend some time doing almost all of the housework (laundry, dishes, vacuuming, tidying etc) while I WFH.

Here's the thing: he hates me WFH. He says he gets no time to himself because I'm always home. We have a small 2-bedroom apartment and I pay extra rent each month to cover the second bedroom, which is my office. He doesn't have the ability to work from home; he works in a physical, outdoor job, but his finish times often vary (ranging from 3 hours early to 1 hour late - more often than not, it's about 1 hour early). He gets a long weekend every second week, so I always go into the office on that day to make sure I'm out of the house. I am sometimes in the office more than that, maybe once a week, but it's once every two weeks at a minimum on his day off. I also try and go for walks in the evening when we're both off work so he can have some time to himself after work, not to mention I am out for my hobbies and me seeing friends etc. In general, I'm out about two evenings each week after work, and usually for a reasonable portion on one of the weekend days.  
Despite this, he still is constantly frustrated by me WFH and being home all the time, and I don't know how to address it. I feel like I am compromising by paying extra rent, by going into the office on his days off, and by trying to plan my time around when I know he will be home to give him some time alone. He told me earlier that I ""get off on"" the fact I get to work from home, so I don't think he sees these things - either as compromise enough, or at all. I get defensive when he brings it up because it feels like he disrespects my working from home as just ""being at home"" and me ""always having alone time"", when in reality, I am working, I am not relaxing at home.

I had a sad friendship break up from my best friend in high school and I just have not really been able to make many long term meaningful connections with women. (I’m in therapy lol) I met a girl in school who I clicked with. We partied a lot together. We have similar outlooks on life which we bond on but we do not have similar morals and behaviors if that makes sense. I’ve always considered her my party friend. During the pandemic she moved and we began texting often. So we do know a lot about each other’s lives. Still I don’t really consider her my best friend. So recently she came back into town, I thought it was just to visit but she wants to move back. Only problem is she has no job, no money, no car, nothing. And I know this is going to sound bad but I did not want her to stay with me. For a few days sure, for weeks while I’m constantly leaving for work? No. I do not trust her alone in my house (I don’t trust anyone alone in my house) she’s also told me that shes stolen from people… so fast forward to last week my old fwb came into town. We went out and I brought him back to my place and yea. He ended up staying the whole next day too. But we literally were up under each other the whole time.

Something I feel might be important is I have ADHD and Autism, although not important at this specific part of the story. My sister (16f) was working in the kitchen. I went to grab some bread and the following conversation:

Sis: Get out, I'm working  
Me: I'm just making a snack

I went over to grab the bread.

Sis: What are you doing?  
Me: Making a snack  
Sis: Why can't you just get a normal snack like a granola bar?

For some reason, this kind of pissed me off. There's no particular reason for it to, but I usually have a ""routine"" for when I get home, and I tend to get upset (Or confused, really depends on the situation) when I can't follow routine suddenly.

I just sighed and went to the pantry to get the granola bar.

Sis: OH MY GOD I WAS JUST TEASING YOU GO MAKE YOUR STUPID TOAST!  
(I have trouble telling sarcasam apart from seriousness, so I always assume everything's serious unless there's a tone indicator like /j, /srs, etc)

But he’s also used to begging at the dining table for people food and getting food scraps from my fam (safe food scraps, they look up things that dogs can/can’t have). He also buries food in places to eat later like his blanket, including the people food he gets.

Our dog, who is much bigger (and just as adorable) does not eat people food. We’ve trained him to give us space when eating and we know we can’t give him people food or food at the table because once you open that door it’s never closing. 

Our dog is also allergic to poultry, and it took 6 months of going through awful elimination diets and slathering his armpits with bag balm to get him to stop licking his skin raw to figure this out.

This isn’t the first time my family has been up to stay at my apt with their dog. I made it clear from day 1 that they can’t feed their dog people food while they’re staying here because if our dog sees that happening he’ll start to beg, too. 

Ok so this thanksgiving, my mom and sister admitted to sneaking their dog people food “while our dog wasn’t around.” And today, two days after they left, our dog licked his armpits raw from an allergic reaction. He had to have gotten into turkey somehow so I knew I needed to remind my family why they really can’t feed their dog people food while they stay at our home.

I sent a text to my family that said the following:

“Hey y’all, we really need you to not sneak food to your dog when he’s up here with us. Our dog got into some turkey and his armpits are all red and inflamed because he got an allergic reaction to poultry. I wasn’t sure if his allergies included all poultry but now we definitely know for sure no poultry. So while your dog is up here we really need no chances of food making it on the floor where our dog can find it”

My sister responded with this message:
“Your timing is horrendous. Mom and I really don’t need your sanctimonious nagging right now. We’re about to play a concert 🤬🤬🤬”

Now, I know my sister gets really stressed out before concerts. And I also know I can be pigheaded sometimes and insist I know the best way to do something/am right/ etc.

A couple years ago, my brother was needing a place to stay and we had an extra room. Ever since, he’s been renting a room at our place. About two months ago, I had ordered a table for our dining room. I paid for this with my own money and my brother was not involved in the purchase whatsoever. 

I get a notification on my phone that the order was fulfilled with an image on our doorstep. However when I go outside, I find that it’s much larger than I expected. Turns out the delivery person had made a mistake and dropped off the wrong package. (This was also a table from the same company.) It was even addressed to a different person. The package was so heavy that it wasn’t something we could easily send back to the company. 

Long story short, I finally received my original package, but every delivery person couldn’t take the other package back with how large it was. I called the company I ordered from and didn’t receive much help. So, I just decided to sell the other table. 

I end up selling it for around $500 on Facebook Marketplace. My brother had asked one night over dinner what I did with the table I wasn’t supposed to receive. I explained the struggles with the company and that I sold it. My brother asks if he can have half of the profit since the package was mistakenly delivered. I was a bit caught off guard considering I was the one who ordered a table in the first place. I had very politely told him no since I was the one who ordered something and I dealt with the company, delivery trucks, etc. He continues to ask about splitting the profit. I just found this kinda uncomfortable- like I would get it if a random package showed up at our door and I decided to sell it… but I ordered something and I received the incorrect item. 

Now, my brother has been very cold towards my husband and I. We will say hello and not get a greeting back. We will be in the living room, and he will walk by without making eye contact. This is very unusual, as we’re usually pretty chatty.

My friend (A) asked me to play and I told him there's only small windows where I may be able to come on. One of this windows arrived and I invited him and our third mutual friend (B) on to game. A few games later, friend A asks to invite a 4th guy (C) that he knows to join us, to which we all agree. When we join the next game together, friend A and his invited friend C begin to intermittently speak their home country's language together. Not a big deal of course. A few games in however, the two are speaking exclusively their language. Me and B at this point are just silent for the majority of the time we are alive in the game, and for the full time when we are dead as there's a clear feeling of exclusion.

At the end of the last game, I say ""GGs"" and hop off quickly to go play something else with friend B as we're both pretty annoyed at this point. Friend A messages me saying I'm sorry I couldn't get you back sooner (talking of gameplay) I know that was long. To which I replied that it was not the length of my death that bothered me, but his speaking only to friend C for 30 mins straight. His response from there was that I am too sensitive, that every other guy would not have cared, and some additional things such as him always having to feel like he's on ice with me and that he needs to be perfect for me to have fun with him. Naturally this conversation expanded and it's been going ever long and ever hurtful since.

My question to reddit, AITA for telling him what I felt he did wrong? And is what he did wrong really a bad thing, and would you personally have minded?

They are what everyone I think would call toxic.

Me (f 22) and her (f 23) are not friends, we never were and I never plan on being friends because she has hurt many of my friends in the past, and I haven't liked her since we were 15, because she came to my house uninvited, and did not ask properly or wait for me to respond, called my friend's names (like fat, ugly, stupid, w\*ore and b\*tch, and she almost broke one of my other friends foot after she got angry.  

She is not popular at our workplace, as she talks shit about literally everyone here. She has since she was young and I think it may just be her personality.

I had a fight with one of my coworkers (m 24) as he was threatening to do something to me and my friends (f 24 and f23) that we found rude and childish, so I acted immaturely and purposefully bumped into his shoulder hard. She and another one of her friends (m 24) were standing rather close to him so when I bumped into him I accidentally bumped into her as well. Later that week I profusely apologised to him as I acted wrongly in that situation and wanted to set things right, he forgave me and we forgot about it. 

Two weeks later, I learned from a friend in the workplace (f 21) that she was saying that I ""pushed her down the stairs"" and that she was ""Scared for her safety because I was dangerous"" I was completely shocked, I immediately told my friend the real story, and we laughed about how stupid she was for making up something fake like that. Other people who already knew about the rumour and didn't believe her, joined in and we started joking about how I was ""clearly psychotic"" and that I was ""the reincarnation of evil"" or something like that. We made jokes that whenever she was gonna walk downstairs we would yell ""CAREFUL"" to startle her like I was coming to hurt her (we never actually did).  It was extremely funny at the time and still is. 

I confronted her today, wanted to ask why she would do something like this, as I have given her no indication that I hate her nor would I have any reason to (that she knows) but she looked at me and said ""This isn't a conversation we should be having, this is a conversation for YOU to be having with HR"" Completly surprised I was confused as I thought this was a conversation we should be having because she started something untrue about me and if anything WE should be talking to HR. So I told her that we are having a meeting tomorrow with HR about it to talk about it. (I might update after)

Last weekend I had my bachelorette party in Las Vegas, and it was truly a wonderful time. Lots of laughing, drinking wine, party nights out. One of the nights involved going to a strip club (not my idea but I didn’t exactly have a choice in the matter). Not exactly my style, but all in good fun. (My husband was fully aware and on board with the strip club visit.)

At the club, my bridesmaids bought me dances from a few of the strippers (all male), which was fine/fun. This was all very unlike me, which they got a big kick out of. Toward the end of the night, they asked me who my favorite was, and I told them, a guy who was the most cute and normal seeming of the bunch. They paid for a private dance in a back VIP room. 

So I went, it was just the 2 of us. Everything was fine - there was no touching or anything. But, during the time back there he asked if I wanted him to take off his bottoms, to see a guy naked for one last hurrah. In a moment of weakness or bad judgment I said sure. 

So, he looked really good naked. I liked it. It was fun, it was sort of a liberating feeling, it was a turn on. I was blushing like crazy but couldn’t take my eyes off him. He got aroused at one point, and my heart was beating like crazy. 

Anyway, that was it! I did think about him again at the hotel room that night, I was very worked up (yes, I did take care of myself thinking about the whole situation). But it hasn’t been on my mind at all since.

She doesn't have that many friends and is extremely close with her best friend who is also her roommate. Me and her best friend got along very well in the beginning but it seems like ever since me and my girlfriend have made it official she has consistently found issues with me. Here are some of the many things that she has done to make me feel this way. 

1. She treats my girlfriend like shit &amp; never takes accountability. As i mentioned they are roommates and share a house together. She has no respect for my gf's privacy and will bang on her door until she answers. There has been one too many times where me and my girlfriend have been trying to have private time where her best friend would come banging on the door just to demand my girlfriends phone charger or something else from her. The other night my girlfriend had to get it back and politely knocked on her door and the way her friend responded was by chucking the charger at her face and not saying a single word. Everytime my girlfriend has tried to say something to her about the way she makes her feel, her best friend blames it on her autism for not understanding social cues. I fully understand that sometimes it can cause people to act certain ways, but it's not an excuse to be a flat out asshole to me all the time.  
2. On my girlfriends birthday I got her a very special gift related to her favourite show &amp; one of our favourite albums on record. Her friends immediate response was ""You literally picked the worst scene out of the show and judged it, then rolled her eyes at the album I got my girlfriend. ""Its not that that's bad or anything but like people who like \_\_\_\_\_ are like people who like rick and morty you know what I mean?"" (I love all u rick and morty fans)
3. She expects things from me because I'm her best friends boyfriend. I.e, weed &amp; food. She even went as far as to call me stingy because of the fact that I wouldn't by her food on the basis of her BF buying my GF a Mcdonalds combo like a month prior. 
4. She is just fully a dick to me. Wether it's debating every statement, having the need to disagree, judge me etc. In other words, she has a god complex.

once we got back home i sent my mom a message explaining to her how disrespectful my sister is. even my friend who was on the phone was stunned at my sisters disrespect towards me. my mom somehow managed to blame me for what happened and our conversation ended there. when she got home, we had a civil conversation and i did admit that sometimes i can be bossy and mean to my sister but that i’ll work on it. my sister heard us talking so she came outside and my mom told her that the way that she acts isn’t okay and my sister walked away and said “i’m done with both of you.” as she walked past my room she slaps me across the face. my mom said nothing, and we haven’t spoken since. so, AITA for telling her i want her out of my life?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4839548,public,top,self,AITA for telling my sister i want her out of my life?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8hs8o/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_want_her_out_of_my/,all_ads,6,

Mike is married to “Brenda”(f38). Side note, Mike had a certain type of mental disability that makes him behave a little strangely, and also prevents him from furthering his education or holding down a job. Brenda has a great career and earns enough to support them both. Mike and I have never really had a personal relationship outside greeting each other and small talk at family events, Mike used to be very good friends with my friends, but they cut contact and I never asked why. 

I attended this last thanksgiving at my in laws, Brenda stayed home however due to being sick, so Mike came alone. Mike acted drastically different in the absence of Brenda. He laughed, danced, joked, when on and on about his art projects. He was an absolute delight. At one point in the night he told me that he couldn’t act this way around Brenda because she finds him embarrassing, and finds his art a huge waste of time. I thought his art was great and he invited me to follow him on social media. 
A few days ago I commented how much I liked his latest art piece on his page. Dan told me that when Brenda saw my comment, she went ballistic and her and Mike had a huge fight. Dan told me that I need to block Dan on all devices, because she’s very jealous and doesn’t allow him to speak to other women. I told Dan I thought this was crazy, and that Brenda seems way too controlling. Dan agreed that Brenda “is just like this” but Mike has someone to take care of him and put a roof over his head, and likely cant do any better so I shouldn’t meddle in their relationship. The whole thing seemed really messed up, so I brought it up with my friends. They admitted that the reason Mike stopped speaking to them is because they voiced their concerns about how poorly Brenda treats Mike, and Brenda forced Mike to cut his ties with them. It seems like Brenda is 100% abusing Mike, and I’m sure Mike could really use a friend. However, I don’t want to be the reason Mike ends up homeless.

We started off in the same position, but I quickly grew in the company with him eventually becoming my subordinate. Let's call him **Adam**.

Adam has always been a hard working employee with lots of charisma, high energy and an interest in learning more about the industry and job. Adam is also a quick learner. However, Adam has a tendency to be extremely late more often than punctual, often absent and has serious attitude issues when he is in a bad mood which makes him unapproachable, not only for his coworkers, but for management as well. I have a feeling he is bipolar, but I am not entirely sure.

Adam has received numerous write ups since he started working for us. Mostly due to his lateness, once for negligence and poor decision making which seriously pissed off our CEO. Unfortunately though, the company CEO is very unhelpful when it comes to resolutions and dealing with staff issues and often drops the weight on me to make the tough calls when it comes to deciding what I want to do with staff who are slacking off and not meeting expectations. Oftentimes these decisions get pushed off and end up going horribly wrong due to my boss not dealing with conflict well. We had a girl once who had mental health issues outburst on my boss, he fired her and then she came to work the next day, refused to leave, boss called the cops to drag her out.. The thing with Adam is that he has positives, he's experienced and can be very useful when in the right mood and productive mind set. Adam has always been a yes man, which might positively effect the company, but has negatively effected him. He is very selfless and does not take into account how his decision making effects his personal life (sleep, setting boundaries) and in return lowers his performance overall.

Adam opened up to me about how difficult of a place he is in financially and personally. While I realize this is not my business and I should not care, I have been extremely sympathetic. I told Adam, we will help him to make his situation easier by offering him time off and different shift slots to see if that would help. Adam reassured me that he was okay and would make the change on his own and did not want his insufficient performance to weigh on the department. Nevertheless, Adam is still showing the same behaviour, showing up either incredibly late or not at all and coming up with the most frustrating excuses HOURS later after being contacted.

This is now weighing down on the team and I do not want to send the message that his nonchalant attitude or his tardiness is acceptable so that it does not spread like wildlife. While I wish that we could turn him around and help him, I think he needs a reality check since he might simply be taking advantage of how easy going we have been with him.

I've found a flight that is cheap, nonstop, and out of by far the most convenient airport around us.  

My partner is asking that we fly the exact week before a large project at work is due. To do so, tickets would be twice as expensive, require a layover, and be out of an airport twice as far away as the ticket I found above. I asked him to see if his job would delay the project for two days to fit the best week I identified. He refuses to ask his boss about it and insists his job is incredibly important and he cannot jeopardize this project.

I told him that that was perfectly fine, and he could just come for the start of the trip and return on his own to get to the project, or he could just not come at all if the project was so important (I'm going to see family in large part and would be going regardless of if he came). He refuses and instead keeps asking that we take the exact flight he proposed. 

He says I have no reason to not change the flight. When I respond that those dates would probably force me to abandon a plan to see friends in a distant city for New Year's, he says I should just take the risk or go and return on New Year's day itself after a 6 hour drive to then take an 8 AM international flight the day after. 

At this point I've told him I won't make 4 or 5 aspects of the trip materially worse for me without him trying to see what his options at work are (or he could leave earlier, or just not go at all). He keeps insisting I'm being unreasonable and not accommodating how serious his job is.
