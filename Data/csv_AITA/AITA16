I wanted to wake her up at 11am, two hours into her sleep to fix her sleeping pattern. So I got a bucket of ice water and poured it on her.

She went ballistic and had a full breakdown claiming that “no one loves her” and how she’s “losing her mind” and she said she’s seeing things and that I shouldn’t mess with her.

I changed her bed sheets for her whilst she got changed and she fell back asleep.

They first stated they wanted to work all the hours. Cool. Then their mom passed so I gave them all the time off they needed. After a week they come back and say they want a lot of hours to distance themselves from their thoughts and grief. Okay. I give them the same hours back. They start calling out and giving random excuses. Then their dad is having mental health troubles and they need more time off. I tell them this can’t be a regular thing. 

After coming back this time they start trying to gossip and tell me everyone’s business. I tell them “stop, if (employee) wants me to know they will tell me.” I have to repeat this several times over a month when I find out they are telling CUSTOMERS this gossip. We have a talk about this. 

They take a shift from someone else because they have a family emergency and fail to show up for them, when we have done that for this employee several times. They won’t do for us but expect us to do for them. 

Now this week they ask for less hours to get another job. I give them 3 days a week and they say perfect. Then 2 weeks later they call and say they didn’t get the other job and need hours. I tell them I’ve changed the schedule several times for them already and will not again. They will just have to pick up hours where they can. 

Now the next week they had another family emergency in another state, I ask what would cause them to not be able to come into work. They were “thinking” of going to be with said family in the other state. I say fine, and I do the job they are meant to do for this week. 

During that I find that they haven’t been doing their job. They haven’t rotated, have put up random stuff in random places, mixed overstock, and broke items to make them fit.

Apart from our appearances he and I are basically the same person, we loved &amp; hated the same things/people. At that time in my opinion he was the BEST of us, like he was smart, talented and get into school's basketball team and I was the 4 eyed nerd he hangs around with. His future was the brighter than all of us.    


We started using drugs when we reached the year 10 all the way until year 12 and University but long story short he started to ""try more heavier stuff"". We were always together at school/afterschool and it got to a point where I ended up always covering for him since he got strict parents. The worse part was that his parents trusted me because we were so close. During year 12 of HS things started to go to bad when I realised that Nick made new friends outside of school and hasn't been going back home for time to time and sometimes for a whole week. But he always told his parents that he was sleeping over at my place but he wasn't.   


After we graduated HS, we went overseas stayed together since we went to the same university. He was changing for the worse overall and i could see that he rely on those drugs very often and blames on the drug when he gets in a mood and fuk everything up in our apartment and fights with the landlord but i was too blind to see it and thought he was just having fun. He fails classes, gets in fights with randoms outside and also with his gf and with his parents and lies to get more money from his parents to buy more drugs. Nick also taken advantage of our friendship but i didn't want to lose him as my friend and I always covered for him even though his parents suspects it but it was me who's telling them Nick is ok therefore they dont think much about it. I was also negatively affected by him.   


When we are almost done with our 1st year of University we were becoming just flatmates than friends and I realised that I couldnt cover for him anymore. I thought perhaps covering for him is actually making him worse therefore I made the hard decision of snitching on him to his parents. I told them everything from 0 highschool to 100 university how things started and how things were. His parents thanked me for being honest and knows that I only meant to protect him. Later that month Nick parents and a few uncles came overseas to our apartment and dragged him back to our home country. He never finished school, never lived up to his  potential, heard he went to a rehab but saw smoking drugs in another old friend's IG stories and just not really doing anything. This was 4 years ago and we just stopped talking i dont know if he knew i was the one that snitch on him.   


I often wondered where and what I could have done that may have had a better ending for him and for us and I often think about him.

For all my previous birthdays, I've had to do what my family wanted me to do, but this birthday, I finally got to plan my own party, and I went a bit overboard with it. I had really been wanting to go to this aesthetic Bistro in the town for a long time, and decided that I would finally go this time around with my friends. One of my friends (we'll call her Alison) is a strict vegetarian, and does not eat anything in a restaurant that serves meat, due to religious reasons. She does not eat at my place either, so every time she's over, I order food for her from an exclusively vegetarian restaurant. I always accomodate her wishes. I presented her with two alternatives: She could accompany us on my birthday if she wanted to, and have some drinks and I'd treat her later to food from a vegetarian restaurant. Or if she'd rather not come along, I could just meet her later and treat her. 

Well, to this, Alison told me that she'd rather just go to an exclusive vegetarian place and asked me to pick one. I told her that I had been wanting to go to this Bistro for a long time and wanted to celebrate my birthday there, but she told me that I should take her religious choices into consideration. We went back and forth about this before she agreed to let it go and come with for the celebration. 

On the day of, everything went wrong. Alison would not stop making comments about me. I was wearing this cut out dress that was tight on the hips, and she kept telling me to go change the whole time because the dress ""wasn't meant for my body type"". At the restaurant, Alison kept discussing her loudly, and whenever someone tried to talk about anything else, she'd end up diverting the topic to herself. She even kept asking my boyfriend if she looked pretty, and at one point, she grabbed his hand, and compared it to hers, exclaiming that hers was very small. I somehow stayed composed and let her comments pass, but couldn't anymore when she asked me if she could borrow my dress sometime, adding how much better it would fit her body. I excused myself to the washroom, because I was close to tears. When I came back, my best friend and boyfriend were arguing with her, asking her to leave. Alison turns to me, and asks me if I wanted her to go. I told her I did. She started crying and told me that I was being a bitch. She said she wanted me to feel how disincluded she felt when I didn't choose a vegetarian restaurant and that is why she was being mean all evening. I still told her she needed to go, and she did. 

I know what she did was messed up, but I've been feeling torn about my decision. I don't know if I should have chosen an exclusive veg restaurant for her, or if I should have talked to her instead of throwing her out, now that I know that she was being mean because she felt disincluded. She's pretty angry, and it's gotten a bit ugly and I don't know who is in the wrong anymore.

On the travel day, they required that my friend and I pick them at a designated place at 4 am. They ended up showing up at 6:30 am, no apologies offered. The arrangement was to pick everyone up at this location but they informed us that there were 2more people to be picked at different locations. We fueled first then left to pick the others before starting our journey.
When it was time to leave, it was already late and his friends were very problematic about getting back to the vehicle. They had a fit that we were hurrying them and we even had to wait for more than 30 minutes for one of them to calm down (she had a break down). 
Since most people had not eaten at their event, we had to stop for snacks &amp; food multiple times during the journey back. On these stopovers people would wander off and had to be begged to get back. On the journey back, we had to fuel so many times since they kept putting in small amounts. I was really anxious through out since most times we went really long distances before we encountered a gas station. It got to a point where they flat-out refused to fuel and my friend had to fuel out of pocket.
By the time we got back it was way past midnight and raining quite a bit. By this time I was already done with their disrespect, inconsideration and entitlement. We insisted that we won't be dropping people to their doors and they alight wherever was convenient for them along our route back. They were angry about this and some women were saying that I was being inconsiderate since they had to walk alone in the dark. But at this point I did not care and told them they were being selfish since they knew we had a long journey back, were low on fuel and it was now early morning and still raining. 

1. They depleted all the fuel even what I had prior to the journey 
2. My friend covered for them for more than half the journey - They did not even offer to buy my friend any food as they were buying theirs
3. They did not end up giving any money for any expenses during the day

I have come to that age where I expect to be put before God, I want to be loved like God by my family members and for them to not put God’s needs before mine.

Let me explain. I would tell them I feel sick, they tell me “pray”, i tell them I’m sad, they say “pray and i tell them I want them to love me they say “pray”. You see my dilemma here. I just want my mother to put me before God.

I told her this yesterday morning and she told me that “I am sick, the devil has gotten to me”. For wanting my needs to come before God’s needs that he can satisfy himself? I believe what I said was right but my mother has made me believed that what I said was demonic.

For context I (27f) dated S (36m) for about a year beginning from the lockdown period in 2020. We live in a smallish town and he and his family own a few businesses in town and they hire a good number of people. I also own a small bakery there which is how we met.

Early last year he and I had a rough patch I won't go into because of rules and stuff. But it ended with him putting his hands on me (not in a good way). Thankfully my business has surveillance and I got it on video which was not enough to get him sent away but he got heavily fined and I guess his employees felt the pinch and obviously this couldn't stay a secret.

People talked. Especially his family, his sister in particular. My business took quite a hit and I'm honestly thinking of closing it and moving away. 
Last week his sister confronted me at a party at a mutual friend's place. So I showed her the video from that day. She went silent and left. I later heard she'd had a screaming match with him and caused his current girlfriend to leave.

My friends say that I shouldn't have shown her the video, but I was honestly tired of being called a liar.

I know that they are buying it for us as gifts. But theres hotel, car transportation etc and im in college still. That stuff gets pretty expensive especially where we are traveling to.

Racist, bigots, you name it - under the guise of “we’ve been friends since childhood “ it took years for him to finally cut ties. There’s this girl from our hometown who’s brother murdered my friend, has been mean to me on repeated occasions and is purposely rude and makes situations uncomfortable that she and I are in together.

We are at the bar a couple nights ago and who shows up? The girl. And who does she approach? My friend. I never have this issue when I’m alone or with any of my other friends, besides this particular friend and another who pair up and turn into pick me boys.

They don’t make it clear that she’s not welcome and even went as far as to scoot over to make room for her to sit with us - I was infuriated- these people are supposed to have my back? And this girl has no redeeming qualities. The only thing they have in common is their want for attention from others.

To me it’s hard not to take personally, and at this point I’m questioning the friendship due to what seems like lack of good judgment on his part - he’ll tell me he has my back and doesn’t - he’ll claim he doesn’t like certain people but will talk to them for hours if we encounter them in public, it’s extremely frustrating.

The flip side is I’m told I’m the Ass becuase I’m too controlling and “mean” to people I don’t like….I’m not mean, I just don’t interact with them? 

It’s confusing and exhausting to be honest, and maybe I am controlling, but from my pov it’s just expressing how their actions and/or fail to act hurts my feelings.

If I was not in the situation I wouldn’t care half as much, but would I be slightly bothered if someone I consider my bff and am seen with regularly is known to be friendly and interact with people I would never in my life even want to be associated with? 

He’s a good guy and pretty smart, so all I can think is insecurities or lack of backbone that would result In his inability to tell someone to fuck off for once in his life. 

TLDR; a girl who is an objectively bad person repeatedly approaches my bff and he does not stop it.

So for some contexts, I am a Military Police Officer so majority of our tickets that we cite people have zero monetary value, they’re usually “Fix-It tickets.” 

I pulled this lady over at the gate of my base for failure to display a front license plate, (In the state of California you’re required to have both front and back if you have California plates) and usually I just pull them over and just tell them that they have to display two license plates at all times in the state of california if you have california plates and let them go on their merry way. However, this lady (who isn’t in the military) the second I got to her window, not allowing me to tell her what vehicle violations she is committing, started yelling at me saying “My husband is a CWO-5 and I don’t deserve to be pulled over and treated like a criminal.” I told the lady that you have to calm down so I can explain what is wrong with her vehicle. After I explained it to her, she started rambling “I been here for 3 years and never once been pulled over for this BS, this is stupid.” I just simply tell her that we are trying to cut down on the vehicle violations on base so therefore I have to pull you over and explain what is wrong so that you can fix it. Than she goes on to belittle me because I am a Junior Enlisted. So I asked for her Military ID, Insurance, License and Form of registration. Everything comes back good besides her insurance which was expired by 2 months. So I got out my ticket book to write her a written warning for her insurance so she can get it fixed, but than I hear her saying “I have better things to do so can you hurry the fuck up?” Than I processed to look at her vehicle without talking to her looking for multiple violations on her vehicle. I cited her for: Failure to Display Front License plate, License plate cover, expired insurance, illegal front windshield tint, obstructed view, and Failure to stop at a stop sign (We have a stop sign at the gate and she didn’t stop at it for us to scan her ID but it is just a petty once to add on.) I wrote out two tickets for her and made her go to Court with her CWO-5 husband. 

In my opinion I don’t think I did anything wrong because I was doing my job to the T. Some people say I went a little overboard with the ticket violations.

I (M) and my girlfriend (22F) got into an argument because she thinks I was being sneaky and deceptive. My gf had a really good idea and was super excited about it relating to a trade up for some items in a video game. She called me to tell me about it this morning and we were planning on having a date later that evening. I went ahead and purchased some items to complete her idea, but after speaking to her again later, realized she was wanting to do it herself. I did not tell her that I had went ahead and purchased anything and helped her instead get some other items. We went through our date and she had not received all of the items yet, however I had already. It was now around 10 hours later after she had told me her idea and since she did not receive all the items yet and it was getting late, I decided then to tell her that I had already purchased enough items to do the trade. We then got into a huge argument.

The trade we were doing was just a test to do for another trade. When I purchased the items it was for the pattern of another item she wanted and the items she was getting was a different pattern ID. She accused me of lying and trying to hide it from her and also trying to hoard items with that pattern so I could do a different deal behind her back. We have been together for a year and a half and that is not something I have done in the past nor would I. I love her with all my heart and always try my best for her. When she got upset, I got very defensive and tried to explain that I honestly was not trying to undermine her and my reasoning for not telling her was because I felt bad about jumping the gun on it and was just trying to be supportive by helping her get items.

I apologized and said I was sorry that I should not have purchased the items, and that I should have told her about it. I did a fair bit of over explaining my position and was telling her that I had no intention of doing something really bad or hurting her and that if her trade up would have worked we could have used the ones I had with the correct pattern to go ahead and start on the real one. She said that I can no longer be trusted. I am really trying to figure out what to do because she blocked me saying I was not actually sorry and that I am untrustworthy.

I can somewhat understand her perspective of thinking saying that I should have just told her about it from the beginning. But what I do not understand, is that I really was not hiding it from her to be malicious, I was doing it because I thought she would think I was stealing her thunder from her idea by doing it for her rather than allowing her to do it herself.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4811500,public,top,self,AITA Girlfriend says I cannot be trusted,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0scs8/aita_girlfriend_says_i_cannot_be_trusted/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I have never felt a strong pull to one person so I havent felt the need to. I 23F currently have a 3mnth old son. I know who the father is based on the 72 hours conception window from my doctor. I was on BC but it failed. So here we are. 
The weekend of Thanksgiving i saw a old flame we will call him Jace. We saw eachother for a night and then he went back to his city. Fast forward to January. I start to feel sick on a trip. So i take a test and its positive. I call a OBGYN and schedule go in and find im 9 weeks pregnant. I start to do math and narrow it down to 2 guys. I wait till i see the doctor at 13 weeks before telling either one. While at my doctor's we did the ultrasound and she asked if i knew i had double ovulated. I responded no. She explained to me she can see the second ovulation was the culprit of the baby. And gave me a 72 hour time frame of when the baby was most like concived but also let me know it could be 2 days before then or after. 
After doing the math i realized that only 1 fit that time frame the old flame Jace. I saw no one 2 weeks before or after him due to a heavy work schedule. So I proceeded to let him know. 
His first response was was it a std. I told him no and then he asked if i was pregnant. I told him yes and its yours. He told me i needed to sit down and talk it through with him and his new GF of two weeks!! I told him she didn't need to be part of it and we stoped talking for a bit. He then told me have it dna tested before birth to which i said no. He then told me to just get rid of it. Mind you im 16 weeks at this point. I explained to him i wasn't going  to, but i was only 23 so i was looking in to alternatives. After a lengthy argument over testing before birth and then over not having the baby i was done. We stopped contact till i was 8 months along. I let him know where the baby would be born and asked if he wanted to go to a ultrasound. (A lot of family and friends had told him how much he looked like him already) He agreed to go but then canceled a hour before. I was heated but let it go for the baies sake. Fast forward to babies delivery i sent him photos told him the name i picked and asked if he wanted to see him. He no he is sure its not his and if it is he will take him from me then said even if hes not he will take him. I'm just shoked and upset. He then demanded i put him on the birth certificate to which i responded no. He then told me i should have never had the baby and got rid of it when i could, and again requested dna. I ended up blocking him. Ill send him a yearly update. But am i an asshole for not agreeing to the dna. I dont need his child support. I am happy taking care of my boy so why would I want to have him in his life when he has never believed he is his, nor wanted him to be born.

S introduced A and I recently after being friends for a while, and it’s important to note that we are into all genders. 

This weekend S was out of town, so A and I spent it together. She has a toxic ex she goes back to when she’s craving intimacy, and we talked about it a lot. I offered to fulfill her physical needs while remaining friends. I’m not new to these kinds of boundaries, and I have a healthy partner that takes my romantic attention. He knows and has no issue with it, nor is he involved at all. 

A was into it, but we figured we should run it by S just in case in a group chat. And wow… it was bad. Long story short, they said it would ruin our friendship and we would regret sleeping together since we were looking for platonic friendships. It caught both of us off guard. We immediately apologized for bringing it up, but they said they didn’t have time to talk about it. 

So nothing happened. We texted S to reassure them that nothing happened, and they continued being defensive about us even considering it. We haven’t heard from them since, and I’m not sure what to do next. They’ve never shown interest in either of us romantically or otherwise. Maybe they have a point about our dynamic changing, and I would like help seeing their side before I approach them. Im having trouble seeing what the issue is since A and I wouldn’t be romantically involved. 

One other thing: we don’t have a lot of queer experiences, and we want to explore in a safe way. This isn’t just a momentary urge, but also a deeper desire to be queer. Most of our experience is with the opposite sex.

My brothers and I have had close family forget our birthdays so we know it can hurt.

My birthday is on a holiday, which I'm okay with. It's my favorite holiday, but people use it to do the easiest thing and get me a big bag of candy. When I was younger I loved it but I don't care for candy anymore and still get tons of it for my birthday. I'm still grateful they thought of me, it's a holiday and can slip peoples minds.

The brother here I'll call Greg(23), we still live with our mom. I'm (F19) a high school graduate. I work for just over minimum wage. Greg is a college grad who makes 2x the amount I do. We both pay bills. Our family birthdays are all close together. 2 in August, 8 in October, one November and one December.

My brother and I have always been close, we talk about everything. When shit hits the fan we've always been here to talk about it, give each other advice and support, though he can be selfish at times.

On to the situation now, my birthday is the last of October, right before his. I pretty much spend my birthday and the days up to it figuring out what I can get him. He's picky so it takes a good amount of time to find the perfect gift. Last year I made a brownie cake along with the gift I got him and he didn't hesitate to tell me he doesn't like cake. I tried to let him know I was aware and tested it to make sure it was more like brownies knowing he loves them but he refused to try it. He's also said on multiple occasions when receiving a gift ""what am I supposed to do with this"".

This year on my birthday I didn't even get a ""happy birthday"" from him, let alone a gift of any sort. As I said we talk about everything so I know he had plenty of ideas, but it could've been a hand written card for all I care, he can do what he wants with the money he makes, it's just the fact that he didn't make an effort at all. I was pretty upset about it and it still hurts, I got a little distant for a couple days and I did make a joke about him not getting me anything but aside from that I hadn't said anything and didn't plan to. I didn't let it affect how I treated him when his day came around, I made him brownies and got him a few gifts. It just hurt, I feel I always do my best to help him feel special and appreciated and he fully expects and wants it from everyone, but he can't even tell someone else happy birthday without being told to do so, never mind get anyone anything.

I tried talking with my boyfriend about this but he wasn't much help, just reiterated that he can do what he wants with his money and wouldn't understand that that isn't what I care about. He told Greg about it. Greg has been distant and cold with me since and won't talk to me now. I never planned on telling him, I know he doesn't have to it just hurts that he doesn't seem to care. But now I'm left wondering am I acting selfish or entitled?

My MIL is extremely dependent on her son (my husband, she literally will scan every mail document and make my husband translate it). My MIL has no concept of the law here, does not know how to pay bills, doesn’t speak English. 

Anyways, she (prior widow) recently got divorced (2 year marriage) from her second husband. She decided to “sue” her ex husband to teach him a lesson in divorce settlement. We all told her to please not do it. Me, my husband, my mother (who is her friend), etc. She decided she can handle this, hired some lawyer off the chinese news paper, and it was a disaster. Nothing was listed correctly, bunch of pre-martial asset was counted as marital asset and bunch of marital asset was counted as her ex husband’s pre martial asset. Anyways. She really screwed up, her lawyer also screwed up. She had no idea to even review the documents despite she specifically found a chinese speaking lawyer. So instead of getting her ex-husband to pay her, she now owes her ex husband 70k. SHe didn’t tell us until near the end, no one had a chance to review the documents.

She does not have that much cash and is asking me to lend her 50k. I asked for a promissory note prior to doing so. 

Here is why she and my husband thinks I’m an AH (and maybe I am). Back in our mid 20’s, we were looking at buying a townhome. She lent us 185k in cash so we didn’t need to take on a mortgage. At the time, I suggested we make a promissory note for that - they declined it (mostly because it’s too much work for them and they got lazy, and “no need to keep tab on family”). I was also unhappy about this entire event as well for multiple reasons (it’s also hard for me to just cash out 50k, it would almost deplete my entire emergency savings). They though I was an AH to not return the generosity and trust my MIL bestowed on me.

She doesn’t have Reddit so I’m doing it on her behalf. I didn’t completely agree with what she did with her other friend so came here for different opinion. Just to clarify again, I’m not the best friend in question or the person who wrote this post. 


So, I'm learning scale construction (psychological tools) for a certificate course. Considering I'm in my pilot study phase, I have over 100 items/questions in my survey. I need like 30 responses by day after tomorrow and it's my birthday tomorrow - meaning, I will be occupied the entire day. So I asked my best friend to fill at least 5 responses for me, but not at random, since that affects the psychometric properties of my scale (renders my scale useless). 

Background:
This friend of mine is currently unemployed by her choice. She has no interest in working. So, she's free all day. Additionally, all my other friends have those life-sucking corporate jobs, so expecting them to even fill a 100-item form (I've asked them previously anyway) felt too entitled. This best friend of mine, however, is the entitled kind. She made me do a lot of work for her master's thesis. She texts me/asks this from me randomly as and when she wishes- even when I'm between my course, out with friends or busy with freelancing work. 

So coming back, I really did think we can have expectations from each other if not others. Reciprocity norm or soemthing. So when I asked her to do my work, but choose answers in a non-random fashion (maximum 5 responses), she ended up asking me to guide her, as in, tell her what/how should she select answers (even though it is self-explanatory). I told her she's increasing my work, and she ended up saying I'm increasing her work and time. I got so irritated because um, she really doesn't do any household chores, sends me reels entire day, and the 5 responses could easily be accommodated throughout the day. I got so irritated that I recalled my Google form link and told her that there is no need to fill it anymore. After that, I asked her to not come to my birthday and I'll make plans with others because I feel friendships don't mean only fun. A friend in need is a friend indeed or whatever? So, I don't really feel guilty though my friends and family are trying to make me feel that way.. but I guess I've a low frustration tolerance.

Second date, I pick out a board game spot near her (we live about 50 miles apart). Turns out she's a regular there.

Third date, I suggest we cook a meal and watch Harry Potter. She suggests her place. We go over recipes and ingredients via text. Hit traffic, and tell her I'll be a few minutes late. She says ""great! it will give me time to clean up.""

I show up, and she greets me at the door with a bag of trash. I walk in, the place smells like a mix of mildew and other funky smells.

There's a brown spot on the living room carpet, molten wax on the coffee table, and a sink full of dirty dishes. We start cooking, and she pulls out the cutting board that has crumbs all over it. I open the fridge to store the things we're done with, and she says ""don't look in there, it's embarrassing.""

Then, we go sit on the couch, which is missing couch cushions and has been torn up by her pets.

We flip on Harry Potter, watch the first film, then she asks me to start cutting sewing patterns. Weird, but I'll go with it.

I go to the restroom, and there are no towels to dry my hands. Continue snuggling on the couch. She asks me if I could massage her shoulders, I do.

Movie ends, I say goodbye, we hug. I tell her about some plays closer to me the next weekend.

During dinner, she said she'd like to meet someone to go to the gym with, and with my baggage from family, I don't really want to be judged by a partner. The week after meeting, she invites me to go swimming at her gym. I don't have trunks, so I decline.

Closer to this weekend, she asks about the plays. I ask if she wants to go, and she says she thinks she's coming down with a cold, so says no.

I went on dates with one other woman. And we hit it off. I told this woman that I don't think we're a good fit.

She asked why.

I responded with ""I think we have different priorities, at least on the social / home life side of things. Which is fine, but could become a friction point if we're not meeting each others' expectations down the line. I know I showed up a little early on Saturday, but the dirty dishes, kitchen and carpet left a sour taste in my mouth. Being raised by OCD parents didn't help that for me. Also, the distance is a factor, which I should have thought more about.""

She responded with: ""I agree we are not a good fit. I need someone willing to go out and do things. And OCD is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Sometimes people's compulsions include cleaning, but for many people with TRUE OCD, like myself, its way more. And people who are obsessed with cleaning does not make them OCD. Also, its sad you judge someone based off the not having all the chores done. I am a very active person, and specially told you I ran out of time to finish cleaning before you came. I hope you meet the submissive house wife you are looking for asshole.""

The boys were to all sleep in one room, while the girls had the other. My dad was the only adult there, (God bless his soul) and was a very gracious host with very few rules. The only rules he had were if you made a mess, clean it up, and that there were no boys in the girls room and vice versa.

 While we were there, a few of the girls there were acting rude and entitled. In the first few minutes after they arrived, they went into their room and closed the door. We had all agreed to go out on a boat as a group an hour after everyone arrived. About an hour and a half later, I knocked on their door and told them that they needed to hurry up, which was met with annoyed responses along the lines of “We know we know” and proceeded to take another hour, delaying the rest of the group. They sometimes wouldn’t clean up after themselves, leaving me or my dad to do it, they referred to my dad by his first name, thinking it was funny (he did not think it was funny) and were generally not very nice during the trip. 
The main issue that I noticed was the fact that these girls seemed to always want to separate the group up there by gender, constantly bringing all of the girls into their room or a separate area for “girl talk,” leaving the guys to figure out something else to do in the meantime. This happened multiple times per day, and, being the host, I tried my best to encourage the entire group to have conversation, which seemed to annoy these girls. 
We all went home, and, to my relief, most of my other friends agreed with me that these two people were being rude and exclusive during the trip. One of the girls even told me that they had been saying that me and my dad were being controlling. When I was told this, I sent a message in the group chat that had been used for the trip, saying that I didn’t like how it went and that I noticed how I needed to clean up after some people when they were specifically asked to do it themselves. I did not call anyone out specifically. This message sparked a huge argument, where people got defensive, said i was overreacting, told me that I was being rude, etc.  Long story short, I am no longer speaking to the two  girls that I have mentioned. This argument has had lasting effects on other friendships, relationships and my overall happiness in general. I am now completely unsure if the argument was necessary at all.

Now there are two possible reasons for the dog getting a cut on the eye...

Firstly, that same day i found her playing with an injured bird which had landed in the yard and it was in survival mode so it could’ve scratched her in defense. Secondly, the more likely reason, is because i was doing some yard work using a whipper snipper (string trimmer, weed eater etc) to get rid of the long weeds down the side of the house where there is rocks/dirt flying up. During this, their dog gets all playful and will bark and growl at the whipper snipper because it sees it as a game. I think a rock may have flung up and got her in the eye in the process since it would get quite close before i told it off (it’s also not trained very well in a lot of other ways). This seems the most logical reason out of the two possibilities but no actual way of knowing. 

Now the dog just got a blood extraction for some plasma eye drops for the healing, which seems super expensive. My housemate’s and i are on good terms and have discussed what could of caused it, there’s no bad blood between us and they didn’t seem too bothered about the initial $100 fee of painkillers/eye drops. Though I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault and they keep hinting at things like “i can’t wait to see how much this all comes to”. If it progresses and needs surgery it could be $2k +.

So my twin said the plan is to pick me and our little sister up, go to see the apartment, and then she'll drop me off in a city nearby that same day she picks me and our little sister up so I can find my own way home while our little sister will get to stay a week.

The situations and reasons that led to this decision are not relevant to this case, except maybe:

- lack of validation on her part towards me
- taking my generosity and kindness for granted
- failure to appreciate the things I do and focusing on what I don't

She has never worked a day in her life. When we were just married (in Peru), many times I begged her to work so she could help with the expenses and she always refused. Kids (now 8M and 9F) were born and expenses grew, yet she kept refusing to work. Somehow, I was able to pull through and at some point my parents ended up providing with support as well.

2016 we moved to the USA, where she has family, despite me not having anyone here. 2020 she got her Green Card. Up until this day, she has made no effort to learn English and still doesn't work, surviving on my low paid job and my dad's financial support.

Thursday (November 17th) we agreed to separate, since the situation at home and our differences and constant arguments were creating a toxic environment for the kids.

Friday (November 18th) we agreed to separate in good terms and without lawyers, and I presented her with my offer regarding financial support, which I'll mention here:

""We will remain in our current apartment and I will keep covering expenses until June, when we'll move out. She has to learn English and get a job. Her income until move-out date will be for her to save. After we go separate ways, and until she is financially stable, I will voluntarily assume the following:

- 100% of child support for the kids vital needs
- Coverage of some bare necessities (insurance, medical expenses)
- Renounce to any claim over the $15,000 that her brother owes me since 2016, so he can give that money to her to cover for expenses, paid in the way she thinks fits best (I have tried so many times to ask for repayment and she always stops me, despite him having many extraordinary and non-essential expenses that he doesn't care to hide)
- Giving her 100% custody of the children

This support will continue until she is financially stable, time when I will assume 50% of child support; she will have to take care of her own expenses then and assume the other 50% of child support.""

She spent the weekend at her sister's with the children and I brought them back today, when she surprised me with her counter-offer (ON TOP of everything I mentioned in the first 4 points):

""- 100% child support for life if she's going to have the children's full custody; else, I have to take one of the kids or have shared custody (I can't because of my mental health)
- Coverage for her full rent""

She refuses to bring in a mediator; I offered that she brings in her sister and I'll bring in a friend (I have no family here), but she refused.

I have scheduled a call with a family law attorney to draft a legal settlement.

My family is Guyanese and her family is Trinidadian. It's important.... I think.

Now to the story!

So this happend a couple of months ago when I got into a really bad car accident and the car that was given to us by my MIL and FIL was totaled. During my recovery I had lost my job due to me having spinal and neck injuries that prevented me from lifting things. During this time my wife and I got our settlement check from the insurance agency, and we started looking for a car. The first thing we did was tell both sides of our family that we got paid and were in need of a new car. My parents said they would help but mostly kept their distance due to our circumstance and wanted us to figure it out. Something about newly married couple trials. Now my In Laws they were different, as soon as they heard we had money they began asking us to pay them back for them giving us ""their"" car. Of course to give appeasement I said that we'll do so once I get back up on my feet and I could work again but my MIL didn't like that answer. 

A couple of weeks later my wife and I found a car that we really liked and it was for the exact price of our settlement check. After my wife and I discussed things further with each other we both agreed to buy the car and head home. On our way home we get a call from MIL, she's asking how we are and checking to see if we still had the money. When I said no we bought a car she flipped shit. She began saying that it was irresponsible of us to not pay them back and how she made promises to pay other people with OUR money. Then MIL began to condescend and gaslight my wife saying that she knew better and that my wife should've known to pay MIL back first before buying a car. This lead to my wife crying, so I hung up the phone on MIL. Once we got home we started to get spammed with calls from MIL, FIL and SIL. I would show the calls to my wife but she said she didn't want to talk to anyone. So when MIL called me and asked where my wife was I stated what my wife told me, I said:
""[My wife] doesn't want to talk to anyone right now, can you call tomorrow?""
That set MIL off with her yelling at me saying that I have no place to stop her from talking to her daughter and that I need to hand over the phone to my wife immediately.

(Now before you jump on my case for what I say next please let it be known that I used to be abused as a child and me and parental authorities don't mesh well with each other) I simply told her no. She has no place to talk to me nor my wife any which way she wants. The worst part about it was that she tried to yell at me so I yelled back saying: ""THIS IS MY WIFE, AND SHE SAID THAT SHE DOESNT WANT TO SPEAK! YOU HAVE NO SAY IN MY HOUSE NOR OVER A PHONE SO GOOD DAY!"" then hung up on her.

When I video called them on the day of, they were driving their roommate's car. They pulled over to the side of the road to open the package. Once they started opening the package they realized there was confetti in the package &amp; grabbed a jacket from the back of the car to open the package on stating their roommate hates glitter. They continued to open the package, got the message &amp; we were all excited. 


A few weeks later my sibling says I need to apologize to their roommate (35m) for glitter getting in the car. My sibling spilled some of the confetti &amp; did not clean it up. I don't say anything as I don't understand what I would apologize for &amp; to reflect if there is something I am missing. All 3 of us are neurodivergent &amp; sometimes I miss social cues. 


Also, there is a long history of my family putting blame on me for things that were not my fault &amp; when I defended myself they'd tell me I was attacking them or lashing out.


After the apology comment my sibling offered to introduce me to a realtor they know. I agreed. After a few weeks of not hearing anything about it I followed up. I was told that it was actually the roommate's contact &amp; before asking for a ""favor"" I need to apologize for the glitter because I disrespected the roommate by getting glitter in his car.


In the time between the initial comment &amp; this I had reflected on the situation, &amp; explained the situation to several friends (neurodivergent &amp; neurotypical) all of whom agree I did nothing wrong. 


I did not know the roommate had issues with glitter (also I sent confetti, not glitter) &amp; I did not make my sibling open the package in the car.  


I explained to my sibling that I see no reason to apologize as I have basically no relationship with the roommate (after staying with them for a week over a year ago I reached out to continue to build a relationship with the roommate but was always left on read) &amp; don't see how I am at fault for glitter being in his car &amp; not cleaned up my sibling told me that I'm being irrational, lashing out, &amp; attacking them &amp; when I'm ready to have a constructive conversation we can revisit this. I told my sibling this feels a lot like how they treated me in childhood (we have had extensive conversations about our childhoods to rebuild a relationship) &amp; they replied ""that's your choice to believe that"". 


At this point I'm basically going NC as this is pretty much exactly what my family has done my whole life &amp; I'm just not here for it anymore.

We're literally two or three minutes away from our destination when Mackenzie out of the blue gets cold feet and asks me to drive her home. Of course I comply because I'm not gonna hold a person against their will (I was tempted to just tell her to wait in the car, it was only a 15 minute walk each way to the waterfall) but I wasn't happy at all and we sat in silence the whole way home. She started crying due to the situation but I did nothing to ease this, I was too angry to talk. It wasn't just about the trip itself but the lost money on petrol, the complete disrespect for my time and the fact that it might be another month or two minimum before I can do this walk again. 

Now some of my friends are saying I was an asshole for doing this, whereas a bunch of my other friends are saying they understand why I was angry and that it was completely understandable that I didn't feel like talking.

I had been seeing this guy for over 6 months and we’ve been spending more time at each others respective houses as of late. A couple weeks ago, I was staying over at his house. We’d just ate dinner and I washed up since he had cooked. He was sitting on the couch in the living room to wind down and was watching tv. I showered after doing dishes and I went to sneak up on him from behind the couch for hugs and kisses when I got out of the shower. As I came around the corner I caught him digging for gold. I didn’t want to say anything because honestly like, people pick their nose sometimes, that’s fine. But then he put it in his mouth.

I was just trying to be quiet at this point and I really didn’t know what to do. I came around the corner and sat next to him and he leaned over for a smooch and I just pushed him away and told him I wasn’t feeling well and that I may go home.

I (31F) am the oldest of my generation of cousins. Recently, my younger cousins (28F, 28M, 25F, 22M, 18M, &amp; 13F) and I were all talking in a group chat about our families Christmas Eve celebration. 

One of my cousins brought up how it seems that every Christmas Eve the adults (all between 45-75 yo) have been drinking themselves into oblivion and how uncomfortable it makes them. Over the past ten years every Christmas Eve ends up with multiple arguments, falls, broken cups that we (usually me) clean up, and inevitably ends with at least 3 people passed out in random spots. My cousins usually end up hiding out while I play hall monitor to make sure everyone is safe. 

My cousins then asked if I could talk to the “adults” to ask for a little more restraint to the amount of alcohol consumed. I said I would (Oldest Daughter responsibility). I sent out a large group text to all the aunts, uncles, and grandparents with the following:

“Hi everybody! Over the last few years we, the cousins, have noticed that Christmas Eve seems to be getting a little crazier than before. To be honest, the amount of alcohol everyone drinks during the evening makes us all uncomfortable. We’re not asking for it to be an alcohol free night, but we would really appreciate it if everyone could try to keep the drinking to a lower level. There is no judgement on any one person alone, and we want everyone to have fun, but sometimes the drinking is a bit overwhelming. Love you guys and thanks!”

Well….this apparently was an assault on the family holiday. I had multiple aunts text me that I was being disrespectful. Also my mom called me to say that my grandma was crying because she thought I was calling everyone an alcoholic. I tried to avoid outright telling the aunties that THEIR CHILDREN asked me to be the “speaker of the generation”, but still I am being painted as the bad guy.

I (17f) have not seen or spoken to my father (48m) in almost a year. 
Background: my dad has 5 kids with three different woman. 3 of my siblings are half and only 1 shares the same mum as me. My parents divorced when I was 8 and my sister was 11. My dad had cheated on my mum with not only one but 2 of her bestfriends throughout their marriage. And after he left my mum he officially announced his relationship with one of those best friends he cheated with (we’ll call her T). My dad and T ended up getting pregnant in their early 40’s and with my twin little brothers. As I got older I obviously found out things about my dad that I did not like and it made me have my reservations about him. My relationship with him has always been rocky as him and I have zero common interest and I find it hard to spend time with him as he is often dealing with my other siblings. 
Earlier this year he announced to me and my sister that he was now engaged to T. And that they had been engaged for over a week and had told multiple people before us. This made my blood boil as he should have told me and my sister this was something he was planning to do before he did it. He drove me back to my mums house that night and we needed up in a  screaming match in the car. I told him it was a courtesy thing to tell your kids you’re making a big decision like this before you do it. He blew up at this and turned the situation around on me claiming that I had no courtesy. I called him out for all the shitty things he had done and he denied everything. So in the heat of the moment I called him and his fiancé a cunt. He yelled at me to get out of his car. We didn’t end up speaking for a number of weeks before he started texting me like normal saying things like: how’s school or work etc. a month before the wedding I had asked my sister if she could text my dad asking if I went to the wedding would I be able to bring a friend ( I didn’t want to regret not going and I wanted to rebuild the relationship and I would obviously have a talk with him before the actual day) to this message he replied that I wasn’t even invited to the wedding. The wedding has since happened and I still have not spoken to him.

When we were kids we shared everything, did everything together and we would even consider ourselves best friends as well as brothers. This changed when my parents got divorced when I was 11. My brother started being different towards me and my parents. He'd focus all of his pent up anger and frustration on me, yelling and then blaming me for our parents divorce, and wishing that i wasn't in the picture at all.

A few years later, we had moved states and schools. The change was harsh on both of us, and with this came more anger and frustration, this time physical too. Another 2 years later, my brother moved out of my moms house to go live with my dad just a few hours away. Now alone, I got bullied my freshman year to the point of skipping school constantly. I would stay at home and play video games wondering if what happened to me all this time was really my fault. I hated it there, but in reality i just wanted my brother back.

Hoping to mend our relationship, I moved in with my dad and brother. At first, he seemed like a changed person. He had a sweet christian girlfriend who brought the best out of him even when she wasn't around. I also attended church every week hoping to see some more change between us. It was great spending time with my brother and my dad again. My brother even introduced me to his friends and we even went to the same college after I graduated.

In 2019 my father passed and within his will he named me his beneficiary. This made my brother very angry and it felt as if all the progress we made suddenly didn't matter anymore. I was back to square one and he left me, an unemployed college student, paying for all of the bills that followed my fathers passing. So i left, packed my bags and dropped out of college to go back to my moms for a while.

I was depressed, started drinking a lot and wasting my days playing video games alone. After some bad relationships i thought i had hit rock bottom, until i met my now fiance (22f). She has shown me that the world can truly be kind, she alone taught me to trust and love again and i truly cant thank her enough for being the most amazing person i have ever met.

That brings me to today. I told my mom that her and I were thinking about getting married soon. My only request was to not tell my brother about my engagement. She begged me to reconsider saying that we are both her children and it eats her up inside knowing that we aren't on good terms. However, i cant in good conscience bring myself to tell him. Besides the fact that we don't have the best relationship, me and my fiance don't want a big wedding, nor do we want everyone in our families to know since we are very private about our life and wish to simply live our lives in peace. So far the only people that know are my mother and grandfather. and her grandmother, but I absolutely refuse to tell my brother.

Now there are two possible reasons for the dog getting a cut on the eye...

Firstly, that same day i found her playing with an injured bird which had landed in the yard and it was in survival mode so it could’ve scratched her in defense. Secondly, the more likely reason, is because i was doing some yard work using a whipper snipper (string trimmer, weed eater etc) to get rid of the long weeds down the side of the house where there is rocks/dirt flying up. During this, their dog gets all playful and will bark and growl at the whipper snipper because it sees it as a game. I think a rock may have flung up and got her in the eye in the process since it would get quite close before i told it off (it’s also not trained very well in a lot of other ways). This seems the most logical reason out of the two possibilities but no actual way of knowing. 

Now the dog just got a blood extraction for some plasma eye drops for the healing, which seems super expensive. My housemate’s and i are on good terms and have discussed what could of caused it, there’s no bad blood between us and they didn’t seem too bothered about the initial $100 fee of painkillers/eye drops. Though I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault and they keep hinting at things like “i can’t wait to see how much this all comes to”. If it progresses and needs surgery it could be $2k +. 

Am i being an assshole?

It's not like outright the presence of him annoys me it's just he does so many things to annoy me and push my buttons. He will take my things and refuse to give it back under the claim of ""I'm your dad and I buy everything for you, (which isn't even true anyways its my mother that actually buys me and my siblings (6m and 19f) need). He also is the kind that ""playfully fights"" all the time despite despite me multiple times expressing that I don't like that. He used to do it to my mom all the time but because she's his wife and im only his ""child"" so he owns me. If I get upset at anything he yells at me because as his child I have to remain happy all the time.

**Now the Situation:** Yesterday my dad multiple times took every food that I was trying to eat. I made oatmeal and instead of asking for me to make him some he just takes mine without asking and despite me telling him that it's mine and that i will happily make him some.  That same day he takes some yogurt that I had in the fridge that my mom said I could have because she already had some. As soon as he heard that I got something he rushed to the fridge to snatch it and eat it. He also threatened to take the coke that my mom bought me for a potluck saying its his house he can do what he wants. He asked me a couple days ago to type some stuff for him and I'm not saying 1-2 pages its over 1,000 pages which is why he doesn't want to do it himself. This job is already a lot and draining and will take a lot along with my other homework, but with this recent behavior I don't even want to do it for him anymore.

I would also like to mention she doesn’t let me tell anyone she knows that I have a sd, especially not her family.
