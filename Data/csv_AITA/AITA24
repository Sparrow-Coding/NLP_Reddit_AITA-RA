Since the age of 12, I was always forced to watch her kids. She ended up getting pregnant again with twins when I was 13 and again.. I was forced to watch her 3 kids by myself while my older brothers got to live a regular normal childhood. 

(Side note: She never paid me, I was expected to watch her kids because she's my ""sister"".)

When I was 17, My sister started taking advantage of the fact that all she have to do is pretend she's going to work and she can go where ever she wants without saying anything. Well, she lied one time and made it seem like she was going to work. We ended up finding out because she got pregnant. I was upset because I knew I was going to be forced to take care of her responsibilities and have to put my life on the back burner. 

All this made me not want kids. EVER! I would never want to dump my responsibilities on someone else. I wouldn't even continue to have kids knowing I can barely afford to put one in daycare.

At 18, I got a job and my sister tried to have conversations about us getting an apartment together. Instant no. To me it looked like she was trying to continue to keep me as a in-home babysitter. 

Now, I'm 19. And me and my sister got into an argument because I asked her for an ice cream. YES AN ICE CREAM 😭 and she told me no and I told her ""It's so funny how I respect your boundaries to allow you to answer yes or no without taking it upon myself and just taking your ice cream without asking you, but with you. You don't respect my boundaries... you expect me to say yes, that's why you take it upon yourself and leave without asking me to watch your kids"" I told her for now on, you need to ask me to watch you kids and stop expecting me to watch them. She said I was petty for saying that.

before seeing him she would tell me stuff like him having a girlfriend. i would be crying when he picked me up and he would promise me that he didn't and that i was the most important thing to him. i had no reason to believe that he did other than my mum's words - but my dad has never lied to me, i was very close with him when i was a kid, more so than my mum.

i saw him recently for the first time since then which was my mum's advice (she always encouraged me to have a relationship with him someday). i've begun to get close to my dad and she says all the past is in the past and he seems to be better now. he seems like i remember him as a kid: very comforting, kind, and supportive. he's also really respectful about my relationship with my mum and never says a bad word about her. i always wondered that, if he was this dickhead guy she told me he was, why was i so close to him as a kid? would i not have remembered that?

my mum told me a lot of bad stuff about him growing up, and i finally asked him about it. everything i asked him had him shocked. i asked if he ever cheated on mum and he said not at all. he seemed incredibly torn about telling me more even when i asked, and all he said was that he never did but he can think of 6 guys off the top of his head that mum was with while with him (which took about 20 mins to get out of him). he kept saying he wasn't shit-talking her at all and was worried he would be 'messing me up' by telling me, and that he really didn't want this to change my relationship with her. he clarified other stuff and it seems that there were parts of my mum's stories being left out that made him seem to be the bad guy, but it wasn't like he was making her seem like the bad guy in his stories.

the only thing that is really spurring me to believe him is that his experiences with my mum are really similar to mine. that she will pick up on something that isn't there (and you can't convince her that you weren't doing something maliciously/acting a certain way), she'll yell at you, and then when you change your behaviour to make sure it doesn't happen again, she confronts you on why you're acting differently. that she can hurt you and when you tell her she did, she says you're unreasonable. when that's not happening she's my best friend, but it felt so good to finally talk to someone who understands how i feel and the conflict i have with her

Some woman stopped me and asked if I don't have any food for her kids. I quickly looked on her and her kids, she was a gypsy as well as her kids (you can call me a racist, but in the country where I live, gypsies are infamous for being lazy or abusing state's welfare system, not all of them, but I haven't met any normal ones yet), her kids didn't say anything nor looked hungry, only stared at me like some props for horror movie. I said I couldn't, in my mind I didn't believe her. Then she pointed to bag with the food I had for my friend (I ate mine while walking). I said, again, that I couldn't, it was for my friend. She asked again and got the same answer.

She knew there was no way she'd get it from me and asked for money so she can get with her kids to capital city (around 110km from the city we were in) where she lives and had 'only' 200Kč (~$10), which was enough for all of their tickets. I was a bit angry, because she asked me for money for tickets, that she already had. I lied to her, saying I have just for my tickets.

I wasn't happy so decided to do some research before agreeing, after a couple days I replied that he had not provided enough notice and told him the actual date the rent increase would legally be able to start. About 5 minutes later he replied saying that he was ending my tenancy and had 90 days notice ending in the middle of the month to move out, when I asked why he claimed to have friends he wanted to rent the space to. I didn’t accept or reject his claims at that time and did more research to figure out my options as this appeared to be retaliation for refusing his illegal rent increase. I didn’t refuse the increase in general, only the illegal timing of it as he only provided **half** the minimum required notice.

So the day comes for my ""move out inspection"" and I inform him that I am not moving as I have nowhere else to go and wanting to give his friends my living space is not a legal reason where I live (I confirmed this on a government helpline for renters/landlords). He called me an AH and said I was putting him in a shitty position and that he should be allowed to have a say in what he does with his property. I understand his position but I feel that when you choose to rent your property out that you lose some of that say in exchange for money. If he wants to kick me out he will have to take me to court which will take time and due to his apparent retaliation tactics he is unlikely to win. I think I'm in the right as I'm following the law, but I understand that this is a crappy position for someone to be in (on both sides of this) and am not happy to be doing so. As soon as I’m able I will be looking to move out.

**Info:** I've been out of work for about a year but never missed or been late paying rent. I won’t get approved to rent a new place, let alone pay rent and deposit upfront as well as moving fees while unemployed. I don’t have friends I could crash with as I’m new to the city and my only friend is allergic to my pets. I didn’t tell him I was refusing to move out until the day of because if he decided to start the process of evicting me I wanted to give myself as much time as possible before risking being put on the streets.

Landlord has been unreasonable for 8+ months now, complaining that my dog pisses in the backyard (blames dog piss for patches of dead grass during a very dry and hot summer when my dog pees on the fence 90% of the time nowhere near the dead patches) and sheds in the house. I had both pets before I moved in. He was fully aware of them both, saw them the day I moved in, and charged me a pet deposit for them.

I didn't come to NC with my parents, because it's necessary not to cut contact with them (I'm the only one who lives in the same city - the others live too far away) 

On Saturday (other week), my parents called me saying that there was a problem with the electrical part in their house and they begged me to let them stay at my house for 4 days, as they would be spending a lot of money to fix it and they couldn't afford to stay at the hotel. 

I agreed, but said that I had my routine and would not be helping my father. They agreed.

On the first day, it was pretty and my mom did everything for my dad.

 Next day, my mom had to make an emergency trip to her sister (her sister paid for her to go and she lives in another city) in the morning. I went to work and had lunch at the company. 

When I got home, my father said ""Wow, I thought you would never come, can you make something for me? I just ate what your mother made for lunch in the morning""

Keep in mind that my fridge was full and my father knows how to cook in addition to knowing how to use the cell phone (internet), he just didn't want to do it, because my mother does everything. 

Me: ""Look, dad, I'm really tired, besides I'm leaving here in an hour"" (it was 6 pm). 

He started to complain saying that he would get hungry that I should make him food for lunch and dinner; my role as woman blablabla. 

I just replied: ""You have hands, you have a telephone, there is the pizzeria contact on the fridge if you don't want to make food, but I won't make it"". 

The night was good and I only returned at 1 am. My father was already sleeping and mum didn't come back.

I woke up late, so I just ran to work without even saying hello to him, so I didn't pay attention to anything.

 As the day before, I ate at work. 

When it was about 4 pm, my mother called me screaming saying that my father was dizzy with hunger, because I refused to make him anything and I knew he doesn't do those things, so it wouldn't cost me anything to make even a basic snack for him, but I preferred to let him starve. 

I pointed out what I said before they came and she started saying that this was negligence with an elderly person (who is capable of doing everything). 

They left before I got home and stayed at a random person's house. 

My brothers are giving me hell accusing me of being petty and vindictive, just like my parents. I don't think I'm wrong, but I would like outsife perspective.

Two of her siblings, (14F and 17M) have with us for the past 2 years and are basically our kids at this point. We are both under 30 and have 3 toddlers of our own. 

In March, her brother, “J” (20M) came to stay with us for spring break. He stayed with us for a year when he was 17 and we parted ways because he did not agree with our rules. After he graduated, he moved in with his mom but didn’t get a job or really do much of anything. While here, he asked if he could stay with us for a few more weeks so he could “get his life together”. I had concerns because of past experience, but I ended up agreeing. 

6 weeks later he hadn’t made any progress. He blamed it on social anxiety and depression (he does have a problem, but he’s also just an unlikable/vindictive person, so he struggles to get along with people). I finally went out and found him a job (took me 2 days) at a restaurant walking distance from our house, and told him that he had to accept the job if he wanted stay. That weekend he managed to get himself hired part time at a warehouse in our town (and we agreed to give him rides if he paid for gas). I said he could stay 4 more months, but he needed to start paying $400 per month in “rent”. We were keeping the money to give back to him as a start when he moved out—we just did it to make sure he kept working. Fast forward 3 and a half months, he was only working 20 hours and hadn’t looked for a second job. He had done next to no research or anything to figure out where to live. We were coaching him on this stuff, but wasn’t listening to us. He spent his most of time sleeping and playing video games. 

I was thinking he would just leave after the 4 months, but my wife wasn’t willing to ask him to go. She feels a responsible for her siblings like if she sends him away he will end up like her dad and it will be her fault. I was not happy because J had not once had shown initiative to change his life on his own. I agreed to let him stay until the end of the year, but it was causing tension between us and she was mad because she felt like I was being “hateful” and had a bad attitude about it. 

The last few weeks I’d noticed he was around the house more and hadn’t asked me for rides, so I asked him and found out he had been fired because he got written up too much. I told my wife about it, and she already knew but hadn’t told me. I also found out that he hadn’t paid his last “rent” payment to us because he didn’t have the money (my wife handles the payments from him). I was super upset because I felt like she was hiding it from me because she was afraid that I would tell him to leave. When I told my wife I was upset she got mad at me and said she was so tired of me complaining about the situation.

We're now at a restaurant because my grandma wanted to treat her.

I turned 17 a week ago. My grandma is 65. And my aunt is about.. 44 years old.

My grandma and my aunt were having a conversation and I thought that they were talking about my cousin (my aunt's child). And yes I admit that I started complaining about how he steals my food. I might have talked a little loudly but I didn't mean to. just the heat of the moment. 

Almost immediately my aunt talks about how she doesn't like the energy and is now uncomfortable. I understand that and I reminded myself not to talk about any other bad things while she's here.

But she proceeds to go on and on about how she never liked her family. How my mom was always messed up. How my mom would always blame her for things and how she was glad to move away from our family. She tells me she won't take my abuse and how I have a massive attitude. How my mouth is reckless and she never has to see me again. I never talk to her (I don't have her number and we live apart from eachother) and I'm always cold. I'm ""cold"" to her because we don't see each other much anyways. My aunt said she wanted to invite me but then I just complain and catch an attitude. I didn't have an attitude. I'm never rude to her. It's just..maybe our personalities don't click. She even told me that I act just like my mom. And she and my mom don't have a good relationship. How fun! 

She keeps talking and talking and I haven't said a word since.
Now she's threatening to leave and I'm hurt. I wanna tell her I'm sorry but I know she's just going to continue to tell me about myself. So I won't bother. I feel bad for bringing the mood down but my intention was just to express my feelings and I did not expect my aunt to go off and scold me. I told her I was sorry just now and she says she needs to process it.

She's still talking about it and it's been 15 minutes. I still have not said anything except sorry to her and responding nonverbally to her questions. It seems like she'll never stop talking about it. She wants a happy birthday but she keeps on talking. 

It came to the point where I just started crying. Only then did she tell me she's sorry and FINALLY stopped discussing it. I told her I never meant to make her uncomfortable and I'm sorry and I was simply frustrated. I told her I will never bring up any bad topics around her again.

I (23F) and my brother (27M) who I’ll call David don’t get along very well. We try to be polite to one another but it is hard sometimes. Last year, my neighbors gifted us a puppy, unfortunately, my dad doesn’t like our dog and has constantly threatened to kick him out. My father is an alcoholic, and so is my brother. Back to the story, my cousin (18F) who I’ll call Laura recently graduated, and my uncle invited our family to Laura’s celebration dinner at a fancy restaurant. My dad is constantly angry at his brothers and avoids family gatherings, so he was clear that he didn’t want to attend. My mother said she would go regardless and we sat down to discuss that one of us, either David or myself, would have to stay home to take care of our dog and make sure my dad doesn’t kick him out as he has threatened several times. 

Now, here’s where my mother’s favoritism towards David shows up. I agreed with her that someone should stay home, and she immediately asked David if he would like to go to the dinner. Of course, inviting David means his girlfriend, Joanna (24F) goes with them. 

David and Laura don’t really get along mainly because of the age difference, and she was always around me. It made perfect sense that instead of him going, I should’ve gone because we actually get along and I care for her. He doesn’t.

Now my brother told me he has every right to go, with which I agree, but when I asked him if I didn’t have the same right, he responded that I didn’t. I told him that Joanna had no business there since the invitation was for my mom, my dad, David and I. She is a stranger to them, I’m not.

As they were leaving they noticed I got visibly angry and I told them Joanna has nothing to do there because she was not invited, and if my boyfriend couldn’t even come, then she shouldn’t go either.

Now my mom is angry at me because she said I agreed on staying, which I didn’t because she didn’t even ask, and called me selfish for not letting my brother introduce his girlfriend to the family. Mind you, I haven’t even introduced my boyfriend to the family either.

I don’t regret thinking that way, since I am tired of my mom making clear that she prefers David and therefore Joanna, and not even thinking about me and my boyfriend, but I want another POV about this.

However, after the break up I would go out out with Luke, Jake, and their friends at least once a weekend. Within the past month and a half I have gone out with Sara 3 times. Once to a country dancing bar, once to a small concert, then to the same dancing bar for a concert and dancing after. I have invited Luke to go with us, but he doesn’t want to go with just girls. I have also asked Luke to go out dancing just me and him. He just continues to say that he doesn’t want to go dance and or learn how to. I have even asked him to learn to dance with me in our kitchen before we go out but, he has no interest.
Last night was the 3rd time Sara and I went out. I went out with Sara over going to a birthday party for one of Luke and Jake’s friends. The next morning Luke was very passive aggressive with me. He said that everybody was asking where I was, and when he told them that Sara and I went dancing they all gave him crap about me dancing with other boys.

Firstly the whole time she was being very Arsey telling me to follow her, here and there when she looked seemingly clueless any who we finally get inside the club and she has a few drinks which she promised to never do and wasn’t on the agenda but she did it anyway once she had a few drinks in her system she became even more unbearable to be around and started dancing on the dance floor which for me was embarrassing as her son but not to be ageist but she’s 44 dancing like she’s in her 20s.

At this point I’m already pretty uncomfortable and this part gets uncomfortable so brace yourself eventually as she’s on the dance floor I saw a guy particularly take notice of her and began dancing with her I obviously went to intervene a broke up their dance which neither of them wanted and my mum started going off on me like I was the bad guy and even the guy and security started on me and I was asked to leave told her to come and she ignored me and was dancing with the guy again along with him kissing her which made me feel emasculated and then I had to leave by security.

I talk to him for an hour more and he decides to go to the hospital to play it safe. At this point I had to go but wished him well. 

A few hours later I asked if he was doing okay and he said he was. Another hour later it was getting late and I again asked if everything was okay and he said that they found nothing and he was fine.

Around 1am I check my phone and he asks me on two separate message apps “is it stuff at home?” “Hello are you okay?”. I replied that I was okay and that I had just gone out with my work mates. I was a bit confused at his messages because they seemed out of place. He got very annoyed and I decided to let him be.

2019 was his family’s turn so we stayed here. Then 2020 covid happened and I fell pregnant in the august, so Christmas with my family was skipped. 
2021 I was on mat leave so would have been perfect to spend with my family, but the three of us (me, partner and baby) all got covid a few days before and I was quite unwell with it. So no Christmas with my family again. 

2022 was already agreed the second we got covid that it would be with my family. I love Christmas, but my partner isn’t as big on it as me. 

We’ve been having a rough patch recently and our tenants are moving out at the end of November. My partner has said we should try having a bit of space for a month or two and take the pressure off our relationship and hopefully it will help us see clearer and work out what we both want etc. I do agree, it’s just bad timing. 

This means between us we will be about £1k down a month, due to loss of rent from the tenants and having to pay utilities on the flat as well as the house. I will be keeping our daughter here, he will be taking the dogs. We will be co-parenting and he will probably still stay here sometimes, so it’s not a break or anything, just some space. 

He’s said he can’t afford to put the dogs in kennels over Christmas now, so he will just stay here and I can go by myself. The dogs can’t come for a number of reasons, and his parents won’t watch them. 

I mean, I’m pretty pissed because it’s a 500 mile drive on my own with an 19 month old. But anyway. I’m going to go because I want to spend Christmas with my family! I do feel really bad for leaving him here on his own though. He won’t go to his family’s because we’ve fell out with them recently.

We were supposed to celebrate tomorrow with my side of the family. My husband decided a few days ago to take our daughter to his parent’s house since nothing was planned for the day. It’s been a while since I had been there, he tends to go alone, so I figured it was a good time to accompany him. 


Problem is, our daughter is a bit on the wild side. She is quite shy, and does not want to be picked up by anyone she does not know well. My mother has been quite persistant and tries to come and see her at least once a week, and it paid off, my daughter is absolutely in love with her. I tried my best too, and made sure to come by my mother or my father house as often as I could. My husband did not, and to be quite honest it’s a bit my fault too. I definitely did not try as hard as I could. The thing is, due to cultural reasons, there are always at least ten people at his parents house, and it does not help to create personnal relationship with anyone. And my MIL expects kisses and hugs without making any kind of effort to get to know our daughter. 


All of this to say that when I said I would come, he asked me not to. He thinks that she’s too glued to me to go to his family when I’m there. I kind of agree with him on this so he has started to go alone with our daughter to see if things could improve. I figured why not. It was supposed to be a short visit in the afternoon. I asked him just before he left not to come home too late, since I wanted her to be well rested for tomorrow. He said he might not be home until 11 PM.


About a minute after they left, I called him to come pick me up, because I realized I did not want to spend the whole day away from her on her birthday. It felt wrong somehow even though I knew we would celebrate tomorrow. 


We arrived to a full blown birthday party for my daughter, cake, gifts, a ton of people. I was fuming. I managed to keep it to myself there, but started crying the minute we left. He has known for 2 days that it would be a real birthday party, and kept saying I should not come. I feel deeply hurt and he apologized when we talked because he said he did not realize how that would make me feel. But he did not apologize for his actions, only for my feelings. Am I overreacting?

I did not invite his family to my mother’s party because the flat is quite small and if I invite one of them, I must invite all 12 of them. When I tried to invite them to her first birthday at our flat, they cancelled the day before the event because my MIL was tired.

Where I live, you can get a septum piercing from you're 16 without parental consent. My friends and I are planning to do it in a month, and I' very excited, though somewhat scared about my parents', mostly my dad's, reactions.

I turn 18 in a few months, but that's not really helpful, as they're of the mindset that ""you're still not an adult, even if you're 18"". Which, is fairly irritating, especially because I see my friends allowed to do so much that I'm not allowed to, though they believe they're the most allowing of my friends, which isn't true.

I'm also planning to go away for university next fall, but I don't see what will change by waiting another year to get it done.

I've always been a really good kid, and have never gone behind their backs, save for little white lies that have amounted to nothing. I really, really want to get this done, especially because I now have people to do it with. They're not insanely strict, but do have things where I feel they are unreasonably controlling just because they can be. For example, I wanted to get my earlobes pierced again (so I would have four piercings instead of just two), and it took my dad forever to agree, even though they are a fairly common piercing, and even afterwards, he wasn't exactly happy about it.

Asking would amount to me just getting my hopes up, I know that. I've mentioned it once or twice, and gotten bad reactions from them both, though my mom has warmed to the idea over the years.

I've been looking forward to this for years, and have never really done anything ""rebellious"". I think doing it would be worth the shit I'll definitely get for going behind their backs.

During my high school days, I seriously started questioning islam and it's values, and decided that i did not at all agree with them. My whole life has been dictated by theses religious rules, but I was obviously too scared of the consequences (could face jail time or even a death sentence) to speak up or do anything, and so my goal has always been to study hard enough to move out of the country. 

I always made my parents believe that I was their pure little muslim daughter, so that they would let me leave with no problems. 

Now I spent more than a year abroad, with my parents financing everything, which made me feel guilty, since I would be getting tattoos, drinking alcohol and doing other ""haram"" stuff with their money. So during the summer I got myself a job, but had to quit a month into the new school year since it was too tiring. And now I feel guilty again since I am using their money, but i am too much of a coward to share my pov on Islam with them, since I know they definitely will stop financing me, and might even come here to get me / beat me up.

&amp;#x200B;

So, recently, I gave my roommate 2 weeks notice that I'm moving out. I tried telling her before that I did not like her bf, and that he is toxic. And that his attitude/actions towards her concern me. I was hoping this would be enough. I did try to catch her alone on multiple occasions for an hour or two, but anytime I'm home, her bf is here. I don't trust him. After moving in together, he would tell me that he never wants me here. Wanted me to move out and cover the rent for HIM to move in with her. I said no, and he proceeded to be immature and threaten to harm my cat. I don't know if he did, but my cat HATES him. She has charged at him and attacked him viciously and yowled at him before. But the fights were almost every night, and I heard her yelling in her room, ""You're hurting me!"" over and over. I couldn't take it anymore, and the stress was getting to the point that I was becoming paranoid and having a psychotic break. I could never catch her alone to speak to her and she never fully ended it with him. Not once. He also goes through her phone/e-mail so I can't do that either. 

Well... When I told her about the 2 weeks notice and why, not at all accusing her, she just didn't have anything to say besides that she felt blindsided. Which I understand... But I didn't get to tell her the full truth because her bf was there. As usual. I don't feel safe in my own home. They had a fight the other night, my roommate being mad and crying because I'm moving out due to his behavior. He kept begging for sex and was pushing her around. He refused to leave. Yet, when he knocked slightly, he let him in instead of ignoring him. I'm not sure why she keeps doing this. I fear for her, but also myself. I'm not okay with him being around me. I also don't want her to feel fully isolated... I want to stay in contact from afar to help her, if she's willing. 

&amp;#x200B;

With the 2 week notice, I'm still paying all of electricity, renter's insurance, and offered a quarter of rent (which she said no to). And half of the WiFi. She already has a roommate found in less than 24 hours, though unsure who.

My sister (25) and her boyfriend (27) are currently visiting with their 3 year old, it’s been super hectic but whatever because they’ve usually been decent houseguests.

My parents have their own bathroom, since it’s usually just me at home I usually have the bathroom on the landing, I keep my towel on the radiator in there.

Sister and BIL have been here about two weeks, three more weeks then they leave, and I’ve been helping them out with childcare so they can go out.

But one time I’d walked out of my room, late at night and saw BIL walk out of the bathroom in my towel!! They were given guests towels, totally different colours to mine.

And he didn’t even wash it because less than 20 minutes later it was back in my bathroom, now I’ve questioned every time the towel has been damp (I figured it was just me using it?)

I complained, no apology but said it wouldn’t happen again but it did, or I’ll go to use it and I’ll be wet and I know it wasn’t me.

I just don’t know who uses other peoples towels?

I told my sister and BIL that until they, I’d rather he, stops using my towel they can stop expecting me to be a babysitter.

Sister said I’m overreacting etc, that it’s unrelated and sometimes BIL just forgets his towel (what like 4-5 times in two weeks??)

That’s okay, but recently my twin has become extremely distant, and I’ve become desperate to try and hold onto him, because while I have my birth family, he and I were raised together and we were all each other had because of being homeschooled and constantly moved around.

I also found out recently that he has furry nazi friends/has said some questionably racist things, and I am an artist in that community so I kind of feel the association would ruin my reputation. 

I’m trying to be considerate, because I know he is only a product of his surroundings, my adopted family are racist, not any extended, just my adopted parents and siblings. Our adopted grandmother(f90) also passed away recently so I wondered if it’s depression and stress.

It’s become exhausting and he only reaches out anymore if it’s to ask me for photos of his pets/family/friends, or if it’s me giving him things like art and gifts.

We were recently going to play VRCHAT together so I could at least see him in a sense because I am thousands of miles away and adopted family do not want me visiting. He kept promising to download it and then just, never did.

&amp;#x200B;

So they send a long msg on whats app group accusing us being toxic and horrible when we never took their issues serious for years even tho we did. and how we were excluding Mary and how i was an ahole that i got a new friend and did not spend all my time with them. and they told us they were not part of the group anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

To this point i was got enough time to think i could not do this anymore and if they saw me so bad to them i did not see why they would want to keep me as a friend bc they told in that msg they aren't part of the group anymore and seemed to cut ties with everyone including me.

&amp;#x200B;

So i told Alice to pay her dept to me (i gave a sum to pay me and it was not all of it bc i knew she had problems with money) so i can get out of their lives fast as i can bc that is what they wanted. Alice told me she can't pay now but i told her i can give her little time to get the money together and pay me back. After a week when i was finally clam enough to msg anything else i told Mary that i wish her everything good and our friendship ends there.

&amp;#x200B;

around month later i told Alice to pay up bc she hasn't let me know or anything and i was fed up that she did not pay me back she told me she can't pay it all right away so i told her to ask someone to lend the money or spend less to pay me back bit by bit i even counted that it would have taken around 4 to 5 motnhs to pay me 50euros bc she owned me 210euros reminder this was what i told her to pay bc the sum was more than a half more but i asked only under the half what she owned.

She asked Mary to pay me back and after that Mary attacked me with her words telling me how discusting i was and the long msg was not meant to cut ties with me just to wake me up what was going on. (Mind you that even tho Mary and Alice were more sensitive they did not even try to understant where we were coming from and put themself as the victim most of the group was fed up with them but did not say anything bc they were my besties at the time)

&amp;#x200B;

I just told Mary that what happend was not only bc of me they had their part too and they didn't see how toxic they had become and they gave me a way to get out of that friendship and i took it bc it was better for all of us. Mary and Alice got more mad but Mary kept insulting me and i kept telling Mary how i saw things and stayed calm as i could and tried so hard not to insult them no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

This seemed to piss Mary and Alice off more but i blocked both of them everywhere i could. I told few more mutual friends and my family members showed the text and everything and all of them said that Mary and Alice were toxic. Maya was kept up to date bc she would have known even if i did not tell her bc we had mutual friends.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4807105,public,top,self,AITA to walkout on my 10 year friendship for my other friend.

I used the word, not directed at anyone. I said that something was a bitch to do. This one girl who really do not know well called me out in it. She told me to not say “the b word”. She said it’s for the girls and I as a man shouldn’t be using it. 

So I would’ve been fine with not saying it around her as clearly it was making her uncomfortable. I said I was sorry and I wasn’t trying to offend her. She asked me why I think a slur wasn’t offensive?

This is what got me, I felt like my apology was adequate but she decided to be a, well you know what, about it. I said that I didn’t think bitch counted as a slur. I said it was just a mean word but to say it’s a slur is a little over dramatic. I feel this way because I am a black man living in Mississippi and have on more than a few occasions had ACTUAL slurs thrown my way. She is a white woman and while I’m sure people have been mean to her, she has never actually been called an offensive slur.

She said there was no excuse for me using the term bitch and that it’s just as bad as any other slur. I jokingly asked what if someone is actually being a bitch. She then asked me, “is it okay to call someone The N Word if they are acting like an N word.” 

This for obvious reasons set me off and that’s when I called her a stupid bitch for even thinking that was comparable.

This lead to a near screaming match and her storming out. The night promptly ended and people were telling me I needed to apologize. 

I think that’s bullshit.

This started over a year ago.

Yesterday  me and a group of girls who we both knew, decided to meet up at a mall so we can catch up, I got dressed put on some makeup and went out, I was the last one to arrive, I greeted them and sat down next to Tara, everything was going great until Tara Said something between the lines of ""omg am I the only one who isn't wearing makeup?"" Which caused an awkward silence between all of us, until one of the other girls who I always noticed would speak up to these sort of things without the need to change the subject looked at her and said ""yes, it seems like it, do you want a medal"" to which I honestly felt happy that she said that cause Tara would always bring this thing up and I mean ALWAYS, even if it's just me and her, at this point the group is still silent and Tara said how she just wanted to bring it up, because she felt weirded out how she's again the only one who wasn't wearing makeup. At this point I got really pissed because she always does this and I spoke about it to my other friend who said that she just want attention and she wants to act like she did something that's so much better than all of us by not wearing makeup and that she's a pick me girl. So I said ""you're such a pick me girl."" Which I felt guilty the moment I said it , let's say that she was quite for the rest of the evening while we all acted as If it never happened.

Another one which was about 3 months ago, me and the same group of girls met up at one of their houses and Tara was also invited, the girl that invited us to her house was a quite rich girl, and she's really sweet and loves to do others makeup, anyways I got there sat with them then Tara came and at that point everyone was there,  we were in her room and she had alot of makeup products, so we all got in our places and she would do our makeup while others can do theirs and we put on songs chatted etc the whole time, until Tara who didn't do anything the whole time and was on her phone with her earphones in, pulled out her earphone and said "" yall look so weird, I could never"" I do want to point out that there were others who didn't do their makeup but didn't made the comment she made and just said they just don't want to put it on , they don't know how; or just not a big fan of it, Tara said none of this and continued saying how unnatural we all look.

 There's more, but I'm too tired at this point, I'm in bed writing this cause I just can't get over it and feel bad, but the thing is she always and I just need some advice, there somethings that aren't completed and some missing some more details but it's nighttime and I don't have the energy anymore,",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4807085,public,top,self,AITA for calling my friend a pick me girl?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzobe2/aita_for_calling_my_friend_a_pick_me_girl/,all_ads,6,,,,

I’m currently working full time. I get paid £20,000 a year (tax not included). My father doesn’t live with us. He is very annoyed about the fact that I don’t help my mother with the bills. Except, I feel like I do. My way of helping isn’t expressing it loudly or making it known. I will buy the house things we need daily (t’s convenient for me and nothing ever really runs out now) instead of doing one big grocery shop. I will pay for any costs for birthdays. I pay our pet insurance. I pay for the car’s direct debit. I pay my own phone bill and my mum hasn’t had to (directly) pay for a single thing for me since I started working full time. If my mum asks for money, I will give it to her. I also have other bills I pay for that are for myself that are more health related. I’m the eldest daughter so there’s no one else who can really do this. I don’t know what bills my dad pays for my mother, I don’t ask or feel like it’s my business.

All these costs add up and I like to put the rest of my money in savings and also just have a lot of pocket change so I can enjoy life (go out with my friends, buy things I like). We grew up poor, I never really got the things I wanted and I want to give myself that luxury. No one really counts those things, I don’t really care, I don’t do it just so people can say “Wow, what a great daughter she is”, it’s meditation the right thing to do. However, my father feels like I should contribute at least £200 to bills too because ‘it’s the least I could do’ with bills going up. I don’t want to do that as I feel like I do my part, my bills are also going up and that money will come out of my savings. I want to build my savings up as in comparison, my friends have thousands in their savings from their parents giving them money to build their future. My parents can’t do that, life gets like that and I’ve accepted that, so I want to build my own way up by keeping my savings as high as I can.

I only have half siblings; we each share one biological parent.
All of my siblings except 43M are married with at least one kid.
My dad is a step dad to 31M, 32M and 33M. They all call him dad and love him dearly, 32M even named his daughter after him.

Back in 2017 my sister had her first, only and very unexpected daughter. We were all thrilled for her. My dad was over the moon, not just because this was his first grandchild but because it was something my sister wanted. He would call her and ask how she was doing or write her emails the entire pregnancy.

So fast forward to my sister giving birth. I ended up staying at her house to help her out for weeks on end. My dad would drop me off and pick me up. He was happy to see us bonding, even if it meant I got covered in baby throw up and loads of laundry.
The funny thing is my sister's mother took all the stardom. I didn’t care at the time, I was just happy to see my niece. She would come by with boxes of formula and tons of clothes, to the point where my sister couldn’t use it all. 

So fast forward to holidays, My dad would buy my niece a gift he thought she’d enjoy and it had to be one upped. He bought her basketball hoop for indoors and her grandma bought her a $2400 arcade basketball hoop because “imagine how fun it will be.”
My dad isn’t going to go crazy spending money on toys she will outgrow or break. She also now has it in her head “memaw will just buy me new ones” if she breaks them, she’s told me so. 

Since she was born my dad has tried to stay involved but isn’t ever invited to anything; in exception to four of her softball games last minute; so we couldn’t attend. She has loads of extra activities and he is never invited to them but her other grandparents are. She lives 5 minutes from us, the other grandparents who also live in town, live farther and my sister actually has to drive past our house to get to the other grandparents.

Keep in mind when 32Ms daughter had a zoom ballet recital he made sure my parents could watch, recorded it and gave them a dvd. He lives 45 minutes from us and visits at least 2x a month. In the summer it’s all but daily.

So my sister's daughter just had her birthday and they went on a trip to Disney. All the other grandparents were included and invited. My dad saw the pictures and he looked SO HURT. He looked like he was going to cry. He said to me “I’m sick and tired of trying to win my daughters affection. It be nice if she just asked. Maybe I wouldn’t go but Jesus just ask. You love me and she hates me so much, I don’t know what I did wrong. Should I have not been honest with her about her mother? I wasn’t the one who f*cking cheated.” He looked and sounded so broken.

Normally I’d ride along in my parents’ car but they plan on staying there for the entire weekend (Friday-Monday).
I work in retail as a cashier so obviously I’m not getting Black Friday off but I managed to get Sunday and Monday off. 
The original plan was for me to go with my brother (24M) and his girlfriend (23F) in his car and split gas and tolls.
This changed drastically in the last few days. First, my brother can no longer go because his new job starts on that Monday so he can’t stay overnight anymore. If he’s not going, his gf isn’t going either. You’d think this would mean I’d be going by myself right? Wrong! My mom just assumed that I’d be willing to drive upstate with my sister (3F) and my nephew (11M).

My sister “can’t” split tolls and gas because of her current situation. Put that in parentheses because she can’t do that, pay her rent or pay anyone back. She can however buy an edible chocolate bar worth at least $50 (by my estimate; it was about ½ the size of a thick Hershey bar), go to concerts and buy random junk. She also recently “borrowed” $1600 from my brother to cover her rent and said she’d pay it back within 2-3 months with the money from her new job at a certain online shopping company, but he only did it because my mom offered to give him the money back if my sister didn’t do so within that time period. Guess what? She’s 8 days away from that deadline, no longer has a job and hasn’t given him a single penny back. 

So I know that if she says she’lI split it and pay me later she won’t. So I’ll basically be covering it all by myself. That’s at least $100 in gas and almost another $20 in tolls. I can’t do that with all the other stuff I have to pay for (more gas cuz the trip eats up a whole tank twice, bills, groceries, xmas presents, etc). I just know if I say I’m not going if she’s not help me pay, my mom will offer to pay for her but I don’t want her to pay for my sister. I want my sister to pay and contribute to something for once. So I want to tell my mother I’m not going unless my sister pays for herself.

So I was wondering: WIBTA for not going to my grandma’s because of this? I feel like I might be because this visit would be like thanksgiving for my grandma so I’d basically be skipping a holiday with her and haven’t seen her since August. I’m also not sure exactly how it’s gonna feel like thanksgiving if there’s almost no one there.

Also to clarify: I’m not blaming my brother or his gf for any of this.

So, my husband (49M) and I (44F) both snore. His has been going on forever and mine started a few years ago. Our doctor recommended we do a sleep test just b/c of the snoring. My husband has been able to do his, and nothing out of the ordinary was found. BUT he was recorded snoring 87 times in the 3 1/2-hour test. My test is scheduled but hasn't happened yet. So that's enough backstory to set the question up.

Two nights ago, at about 3 am, he woke me up yelling ""you are snoring really loud!"" I say yelling b/c he always sleeps with earplugs b/c we have 4 kids and his shift work exhausted him, so he is now used to sleeping with them even though he works normal hours. But he still yelled at me (even unintentionally) and since I was sound asleep, it jolted me awake. After I was over my heart attack from being scared, I yelled at him for waking me up. I asked him what he wanted me to do. And he said ""well turn over"" so mind you he could have easily turned himself over and not woken me.

I've always been very conscientious about his sleep. He is in bed somewhere between 8-9 p.m. and gets up at 3:45 a.m. I am a night owl and b/c of insomnia and back issues, I toss and turn a lot. So because of this, I don't usually go to bed until 1-2 a.m. I figured that way I won't keep him awake, and he's able to get good restful sleep between 8 and 2. That night I went to bed after 1 a.m. It takes me an hour to fall asleep, so I hadn't even been asleep for an hour yet.

I brought it up to him a few times, asking him why he thought it was a good idea to wake me up. He said ""b/c the snoring is keeping me awake"" I've never once woken him up. He never believed me when I told him he snores a lot until the doctor confirmed the 87 TIMES in 200 mins.

A photographer (mid 30s F) approached me and my friend (26F) and asked if we wanted nude photos taken. She said she wouldn’t share them anywhere and would send us the files later. My friend immediately undressed and she started taking photos. I was more reluctant, I had a dislocated shoulder and a black eye so I looked pretty rough. Had never posed for nudes with a stranger. Took me a while to get my clothes off with my injury, she snapped like 10-15 pics, &amp; we traded contact info (IG).

A week after I got back I messaged her on IG to ask for the photos (polite and energetic tone “hope your Burn was great!”) She lives in Berlin, a legit artsy photographer with 4k+ followers. She sent screenshots of our photos and asked for my email for the hi res ones, that was 9/10. No reply. 

9/15 I messaged on IG follow up, no reply. 

9/19 I messaged again on IG. Tried the email on her site but it was undeliverable.

9/20 she sent a link with the high res photos of both me and my friend — BUT the nipples had been blurred out in all of them. In the initial screenshot they weren’t blurred so I was confused. 

Was she going to share them on social media? Why else would she have spent the time editing them? For context: when I was a teen I had someone share nudes without my permission. And I took too many shrooms once and had this delusion that I was famous and everyone was taking my photo. I was kinda freaking out. 

I replied asking for the originals that day, no reply. 

9/21 I emailed asking the same thing. 

9/23 she said she would send in a few days as she was out of the country. 

10/3 I sent another email.

All messages at this point were very polite, lots of exclamation points, “when you get a chance” “please/thank you.”

10/5 I sent an IG message, very short “Hi just following up about the photos again.”

No reply. 

10/7 I messaged on IG saying that I was frustrated and to please send them ASAP. Didn't think it was overly rude. I hate pestering her but I was anxious about someone having nude photos of me. I want to get some printed to give them to my SO and I don’t want blurred out photos! 

10/8 I got a hostile email. She said that she was busy, her parents were in the hospital.It wasn’t her duty to take/send the photos, she was being nice doing it for free, it’s a ton of work, I was rude for not saying thank you. She said she sent them already and the blurred nipples are fine for social media, she doesn’t get why I would want more. 

I had said thank you… How was I supposed to know her parents were in the hospital? And if it was so much work why did she go to the extra work of blurring out the nipples? Most importantly I DON’T WANT TO SHARE THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA! 

I knew she wouldn’t send them at this point unless I sucked up. I responded VERY apologetically wishing her parents well. I shared that I had someone spread nudes without my permission as a teen and I wanted to keep them for personal use. 

No reply as of today (11/19).

They are providing free shuttles there and back, as the tickets for the party come with 2 drink tickets so obviously they don’t want people drinking and driving. I was planning on taking said shuttle, so that I can drink. I should mention too that’s it’s a 20 minute drive on the highway through the mountains, (the event is another town over) and the roads here are already snow covered/icy. I have winter tires and AWD on my car, but I’m still very cautious driving on the roads here. My car is very new and I’m quite protective of it, it cost a good chunk of change, and the idea of someone else driving it kinda stresses me out, just because I’m paranoid of something happening to it. To be fair I’m also paranoid when I drive it, I just worry about things like rock chips, door dings, scratching the paint, etc. I also worry about wild animals, as they can appear on the road at any time here, but especially when it gets dark out.

My roommate asked about the shuttle times last night, and it seemed like they might not work well for her, because she joked that if I trust her enough she could drive my car back from the event, as she doesn’t plan on drinking. She doesn’t have her own car, but she’s never asked to drive my car before, so I don’t really know how to handle the situation. 

I don’t want to offend her if I tell her I’d rather we all take the shuttle and I leave my car at home.

My husband's family wanted to throw a baby shower, so they asked me to make a registry so I did. I was a bit uncomfortable with the idea but I knew they would buy us things anyways so I figured I'd just make a list of stuff we need anyways and if anyone felt absolutely obligated to help they could just choose from there. We had told everyone we will be cloth diapering and to please not purchase diapers. 

The problem I'm having currently is the amount of 2 yearold+ stuff we are getting. I'm talking huge walking toys, toys our baby would not be able to use for years. One person in particular (my husband's great aunt) has bought us 4 walking toys for ages 2-6. 

I am very very thankful for the help but so far several people *(mostly older)* completely ignored what we need and essentially bought what they wanted instead which has resulted in the nursery only having random 2 year old/repeat things/diapers for 2 year olds. All brand new. I fear we have no space or want for these things and they will not listen. 

I finally casually mentioned *""oh! I guess we will just pack all of this up and try to find some space for the next few years until she needs it! Thank you :)""* when his aunt sent me the 5th huge thing she bought for a 24-month-old. She replied, ""I'm just planning for the future"" and seemed upset, which I understand because **she wanted** to buy this stuff. 

I am very thankful but feel bad but I genuinely do not know where to put all this. I hate the idea of returning or giving away gifts.

At first, I thought that maybe this is a good thing, for my insecurities, it’s like this constant reassurance, but it’s gotten too much, it’s exhausting to even text him.

One of the main cast of our show is pretty interesting and funny but she wouldn't be someone I would keep close ties to after the show is over. During a rehearsal break, she decided to show off a performance from a competition she was on 12 years that kick started her career in theater, it was a group ""mash up"" (idk if it was mixing the lyrics of the 2 songs together or one after another) of the songs, Money makes the world go round and Material girl and it was really bad. The contestants were wearing these trashy silver dresses that money was sellotaped too, American money. (Ugh because apparently they couldn't find any pounds or even euros around). The shoes they wore were awful (guess they couldn't find any silver high heels either) and I could barely hear the lyrics in the first part because of the stupid humming the other contestants were making. They did no dancing, only basic movements and the ending was really stupid were the male co dancers start tempting them with jewelry and they actually begin wrestling/fighting with each other and jumping to try to grab the jewelry. 

She noticed my distaste for it and asked me if I liked it. I shook my head and she asked why. I replied that it's not my cup of tea and she should show off something better. She then pressed on instead of dropping it and asked me what I thought was wrong with it. I listed out it's flaws (dresses,shoes,lack of dancing, lame vocal,stupid ending etc) and also pointed out that it makes them look like shallow, trashy, basic gold diggers which is pretty much the opposite of what the competition was looking for. She gave me a kinda wtf look and said ""Jesus, I'm not one of the producers, didn't organize it"", I told her that's cool and I just recommended not showing it off.

After that I feel she's being really cold to me, conveniently having to leave the room when I come in, not really talking to me, I have a feeling some of the other co-performers are treating me the same, over a minor argument with someone else.

She wants to do this marine animal conservation which I support 100%. She knows the risks of taking it on (seeing some die, letting most of them go without imprinting/emotional connections), and I am honestly proud of her wanting to do this.

The issue that came up has been going on every now and then for the last 2-2.5 years. She has a very impulsive personality and I don’t think she understands the real weight, mindset, and power of these big animals. For example, she went camping last year and a bear came up to their other trailer about 20 ft away. Her family literally had to hold her back because she wanted to go up and try to pet/cuddle the bear so bad. 

She brought up about 2 years ago that she wanted to get a puma as a pet, which is an animal she’s been obsessed with for a while and still is to this day. I brushed it under the rug, but after the first couple talks/excitement rants about it, I finally told her my thoughts. I said that I don’t think she really understands the actual risks and responsibilities of taking care of a wild animal as a pet, a puma no less. 

She got upset with me because I “underestimated” her and she didn’t talk about it for about 6 months. Then, she brought up getting a wolf-dog. Not as much of a wild animal, but still a huge, not-fully-domesticated dog. I said that that was easier and more realistic, but she has to know the price to pay with those things and that they aren’t like your typical husky. She said she knows and she would do that. After that, she brought up the puma again a month later. She went on about wanting to buy one and I just didn’t say anything bad about it cuz it was sort of late and I didn’t want to argue. 

Now today, she’s getting a new cat. It’s a bengal. That isn’t too bad, a lot of people have bengals and you don’t need any big license for it. Then afterwards, she kept going on about bengals and then said “My next pet I want to get is a Savannah cat, which is a step down from a Bob cat.” I said she was being impulsive and I didn’t think she actually did the math on these things, bringing up the bear incident in the process as a big red flag for me. She said I was underestimating her and tanking her mood, and now I feel bad.

Last night, my mom called and asked me when I am going to go home today, as she wanted me to stay home and work for the next week for Thanksgiving. This was not a question about if I wanted to go home but rather when, so I don’t “have” a choice. I was out eating and did not want to think about it, but she demanded I give her a time or she wasn’t going to hang up. In order to enjoy my night out, I told her 5pm would be a good time for me to head back. 

I woke up around 12pm today, since it was the weekend and I didn’t have to wake up early for work. My apartment hasn’t been cleaned in about 2 weeks, and I didn’t want to let it sit for another week. So, I decided to clean my apartment before leaving for home. Because I woke up late, I felt that it would take much longer than 5pm to cook, eat, and clean the apartment, so I texted her that I would be either coming home later tonight or early tomorrow morning. 

At 3pm, she called me that it was not ok for me to come home later, and that she was already preparing to cook dinner. This somewhat blew my mind, because I gave her a heads up before that I was gonna be late going home. I started yelling at her that I am an adult, that I can make my own decisions now since I am financially independent. After that spiel, she didn’t say anything and just hanged up on me. 

I may have overreacted here, but I felt some pent up frustration just exploding out. All my life, my mom would put her opinions into how I need to live. She almost got me to live at home with her since I work virtually, but I did not listen and got my own apartment. Since then, she’s been telling me how I’m wasting money on rent and how much nicer it would’ve been to stay at home. If I don’t go home every other week, she gets unhappy and starts saying I don’t care about her or love her anymore. When I planned a weekend trip with my friends, she would complain that my friends are more important to me than her. I get that she might be lonely, but I honestly hate living with my family long-term. My grandparents live with my parents, and my grandma is very naggy and complains about everything as well. When I stay home, there is no privacy or door-knocking. It is so stifling to me.

I am 18 F. When I first started high school, I had trouble making friends because I was dealing with pretty bad anxiety. There was a group of girls in most of my classes who were all friends and since we were all nerdy, they let me join their friend group. I was certainly the outcast of them all because I barely spoke and I was in a different form group to the rest of them.

There was another girl in their group, but she didn't come to our classes because she was wheelchair-bound. She also had cancer, and after overcoming it once, it soon returned. As a group, we were allowed to hang out in the disabled kids area during lunch breaks because that girl was there. That girl also had a twin sister. I will call them E and M (E had cancer and M is healthy).

Things started to get weird with E and I could tell that she didn't like me. She would talk in a very sarcastic way towards me, and her helper (who was an adult btw) would give me weird looks when I was around them. They would whisper together and it felt very directed towards me. I feel like it was due to me being so quiet, but I couldn't help it, speaking made me uncomfortable unless I was warmed up to that person. Overall, E just gave me the impression that she didn't want me near her friend group and as someone with no other friends, I felt awful about the whole thing considering the other girls wanted me there. Although sometimes, there would be a limit to how many people were allowed in the disabled kids area, and I would often be kicked out and left alone during the breaks.

(Just to clarify, I never said or did anything to offend E, and I always tried to be respectful).

I was only with that friend group for about a year before they started to ignore me. When my GCSEs started (British high school exams) they ignored me entirely and luckily I had new friends at this point.

E passed away a year ago, I assume from her cancer. M was in my college classes, and she usually sat next to me. When I found out about E, I didn't feel bad about it. When M returned to school, she didn't look upset, in fact she seemed to be ok with everything, so I didn't take the opportunity to comfort her. Looking back on it now I feel terrible that I didn't mention anything but perhaps it was for the best.

I am still having a hard time feeling sympathy for E and her family. Of course it is horrible that her life was taken but it is never ok to outcast someone just because they act a little differently. Making friends has always been a struggle for me, even today, and I was endlessly bullied throughout high school due to my quietness, so are my feelings justified? Or should I have made more of an effort because she was disabled and really sick?

I completely understand if you think I'm the asshole for this. But I would love to hear your views anyway, and perhaps advice for what I can do next :) It is much appreciated.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4807003,public,top,self,AITA for feeling little remorse about someone I knew dying of cancer?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yznmhx/aita_for_feeling_little_remorse_about_someone_i/,all_ads,6,,,,

I work a full time 9-5 job where there are some days when I have to work extra hours or work weekends due to lack of staff or a sudden influx of work which takes a long time to complete, my brother on the other hand is unemployed. A few days ago after I came home from work at around 7:30pm my mom asked me if I can clean the dishes, I told her no and that she can ask my brother to clean the dishes, but she said he has been doing them this whole time and that it is not fair that only he has been doing them.

After I said that she asked me why I was being so difficult, I was already annoyed due to working extra hours and coming home to being nagged about dishes of all things so I listed the all the reasons why.

1. I work 9-5 with extra hours and possibly weekends.

2. That my brother does not work.

3. I pay a third of my salary to her for utilities.

4. The only thing my brother actually cleans is the dishes, and that I literally clean everything else.

5. Seeing as my brother is the only one unemployed I do not see why he can not clean the dishes everyday.

After I stated my reasons I added that I will not clean the dishes and to never ask me again. My mom got mad and left me alone.

I also have misophonia around loud chewing noises. I try to handle it as best as I can, but sometimes it’s just too much. I’ve discussed this with her before. 

Now the problem: Jane loves eating crunchy foods. It drives me nuts when we’re watching a movie on the couch and she’s eating popcorn next to me. 

It’s right in my ear, so I’ve asked her to stop eating a few times. I’m always quite apologetic about it, and she’ll grumble a bit but she’ll put the food away. 

Recently we were having a conversation and she was snacking on chips. It’s already pretty hard to hear each other because we’re so soft-spoken, but it was near impossible while she’s loudly crunching on chips. 

So I asked her to stop eating them for a bit until we’re done talking. She rolled her eyes and deliberately ate another chip slowly to troll me. She put the bag away then but I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for asking her to stop eating.

It was a 2007 Toyota Tacoma, and it was really great. He loved the truck. He bought it for 15k, and it had super low km.

&amp;#x200B;

**I (34 f) got into an accident with it**, and it was written off for 20k, but he is going to have a really really hard time replacing it. It was totally my fault and I feel awful. He built a custom box for it and everything, and it was his baby. He would also be using the truck for work once he went back (he was on EI for 9 months). So the accident limits his ability to work as he works as a carpenter in film. Although he could use any vehicle technically, he just needs something to get his tools to the site.

&amp;#x200B;

He is also pretty resentful for even having to buy an automatic in the first place because it cost more money, and he has been bringing that up a lot. He says that he did me a huge favour by buying an automatic and now he's paying for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I had almost finished paying for half of it when I got into the accident. The amount I had paid is currently $6484, and I still owe $1016.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the vehicle was written off, he said he would be buying a manual and not letting me drive it (not that I could), so I said I would like the money back that I put into the truck.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked him if he is saying no to paying me back right now, or no to paying me back after he bought a new truck, and he said he wasn't going to commit to anything, and that he can't talk to me about it right now because he is so upset. So I feel like he plans to not pay me back. he also says he feels trapped in the decision I am making about buying my own truck. Which I don't really understand.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I am asking for him to pay me back at all, is because he wants to find basically the exact same truck (but manual) and it's going to take him a while, so I want to buy just a decent ford ranger for 10k or whatever (which I will be getting a partial loan for) so that he has something to get to a potential job with and so I can take my geriatric dog to the better vet in the city lol. and thrifting. etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I should also mention that he hasn't been paying the insurance, I have. I bought the house we live in as well and I rent out the top floor, which basically covers the mortgage and some bills. So financially, he has very few bills so this affords him the ability to not work for long periods of time.

&amp;#x200B;

I really thought I was doing him a favor by buying my own truck for him to use while he searches for a perfect truck for himself. I really want to fix my mistake of crashing his baby, but I feel like I can't do anything right.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I live overseas and have a 5 month old baby. I am travelling back alone for 6 days to see my mum, sister, brother, grandma and father. My mum is driving me 2.5 hours to my grandmas and her partner has suddenly decided that he must come with us because he hasn't seen her for ages. I've tried to say to my mum that if he comes I'll just be sat in the back with my baby but its more than that. the whole dynamic changes and I really just wanted to spend time with my mum and grandma without anyone else. I think he just doesn't want me alone with mum. He said she has cataracts so can't drive home at night but she often stays at grandma's if she drives up so i suggested that. He still wont budge. I'm annoyed because I'll only get that one day to see my grandma and mum and he has any day at all to go up with my mum and see her. My mum has also started spamming me with texts about how great her partner is so it feels like she's trying to force me to like him.

My mom moved to the USA when I was 8 years old, to give my family a better life and I will always be thankful for it. With a lot of work she whas able to become an American citizen and when I was 17 she started the process to take me and my sister with her. The problem is that I have never wanted to move to the USA, I am pretty happy in my home country and I already have a career as an English teacher, I have been teaching for 4 years and I'm on my way to have a bright future on my own. My sister is still figuring stuff out but she is also doing well.  Now the VISA process is almost complete and my mom is very excited for it, but all I can think about is the fact that I have lo leave everithing I have worked hard for behind, just to start over in a place where I don't want to be. I don't want to move, but I also don't want to hurt my mom, she has worked so hard to do this and I feel like she would resent me if I refuse to move and waste all the money and efforts she has put into this process.
