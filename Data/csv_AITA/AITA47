It’s a delicate issue and I’ve been very sensitive to it, because others in his family struggle with it as well and there’s a lot of history there. Where she differs from her relatives is her hoarding of animals, specifically cats. 

You never know how many she has at any point in time, and she never gives an honest answer. I’ve heard numbers from my MIL (who has been in the house and laid eyes on the cats) numbers between 18 and 30.  The cats have fleas, multiple health problems, aren’t litter box trained, and sadly this year a litter of kittens were born with genetic and physical abnormalities and several had to be put down by a vet. 

I have struggled for a few years to gently raise the issue with my husband that this isn’t right and those animals deserve better, but I’ve been met with “you can’t make anyone do what they don’t want to do”, and apparently that included making someone give up their hoarded animals, even if the animals were in danger.

Last year I had enough of silently fuming, and found a cleaning service that specialized in hoarding and would travel to our remote area. Auntie agreed, and they removed much of the stuff she had been hoarding. MIL was even able to convince her to let the family catch most of the cats and bring them to a shelter! We all told her we were proud we were of her. 

Fast forward to this year, and she starts being sneaky and lying about the cats MIL a has been seeing around her house. MIL manages to surprise her one day and finds the malformed kittens… and many other cats. Auntie is hoarding animals again. 

I asked the family what we’re going to do about it. MIL said she tried to take them away again, but Auntie cried. Husband said we can’t make her do what she doesn’t want to do.

Would I be the asshole if I called animal control and let them deal with it, and leave Auntie to deal with the consequences? I’ve tried being kind and gentle, I recognize that hoarding is an illness, I’ve looked up coping skills and offered resources, but I get so much pushback from everyone in the family.

She will not talk about feelings or admit she has them, super sensitive to rejection, oh and her and my wife don't really like each other, so that's a fun bonus. 

Years ago when my mom was single (and for context she hates being single but doesn't click with people often but it was still a huge insecurity) she took my then girlfriend and I on a trip. It was a really nice trip, but she seemed to expect us to do everything together the whole time and we wanted some couple time. When we got home my girlfriend (now wife) mentioned that she wouldn't want to travel that long with my mom again because she expected too much of our time. That got back to my mom and obviously hurt her feelings.

My mom said she would never travel with us again and took that very seriously. She is now remarried and my sisters are invited on ski trips all the time. We are never invited. She claims it's because its his house and he doesn't like me, but I don't buy that. She wouldn't even hang out with us when we were both out of town for the same wedding. My sister claims we humiliated her and I don't understand.

Well I recently found out my mom and her husband are taking both of my sisters and their partners to Greece. I wrongly assumed I would be included. My mom's husband heard and said he wasn't sure but I need to clarify with my mom as he doesn't think she wants me there.

I talked to my mom and she said we aren't invited. she seriously never wants to travel with me or my ""bitch wife"" again. I blew up and screamed at her that she needs to grow the fuck up. She shouldn't even have had children if she is this petty and immature My mom said I'm an adult and not entitled to a free trip, I continued to yell at her and said she can't keep favoring my sisters if she wants a relationship, and she doesn't deserve money because she uses it as a weapon.

the entire time we had been friends, she would ignore my texts for weeks on end, and when i would bring it up she would get pissed and defensive saying she has a life and i don’t always have to be the priority when all i wanted was more than one answer every month. she would also refuse to put in any effort, and if i ever brought it up she would ignore and we wouldn’t talk or hang out at all if i didn’t initiate it.

this trend continued through when we began dating. at first everything was great, but as time went on it slowly got worse. she began being caring, we would pass noted in class (we were both in senior year) and she would just pay a bunch of attention to me, not excessively or anything just a normal relationship amount. 

however, this didn’t last. she quickly went back to the old ways where she would ignore me for weeks and only message when she needed soemthing. it was really frustrating.

naturally, i told my 2 closest friends all about it and she began sulking and telling everyone i’m trying to turn them against her when they literally were still talking to her and nothing between them really changed. if anything, she was trying to turn my friends since middle school against me by talking immense shit. 

i got really annoyed so we broke up in school bathroom mutually because at this point we were  both sick of each other. 

i genuinely cant figure out what i did wrong but she still hates me and when i once approached her to ask about it a few months later, and i was met with her literally lying to my face about everything i asked her about and i got no answer. 

it’s kind of sad because i lost my friend but also i despise her and now she’s moving countries so i don’t have to worry about her. it’s just draining because i was always the one putting in all the effort so im glad i won’t have to anymore

also i’ll add that ever since i stopped texting first we haven’t talked in real life or over messages. it’s been 6 months and i’ve gotten 1 message from her and that was happy birthday.

it’s just a weird situation and all my friends say i did nothing wrong but i need an outside perspective because it still lingers my brain often.

Not married, simply because we don't believe we need the paper to cement our relationship. We both wear rings though and have a son (7).

My sister (35) who is also my best friend, was staying with us while recovering from a few setbacks. Lives in town, but had just had Car accident, DUI, etc. She had previously lived with us for free over a year as well. Doesn't love my guy, tolerated him. Doesn't love most guys due to bad past and our nitwit dad. 

One night we all hung out. Drank some whisky and wine. My partner doesn't drink but smokes pot. 

I went to bed bc I had to work early next morning. She stayed up smoking, is not a reg pot smoker and talking to him. Also, she had pain med (Oxycodone) earlier in the day. Next day I took off work early to take her to see an attorney and out to lunch. She went home that evening. 

That night my guy comes in bedroom phone in hand after I turned in early. Wakes me up saying we have a problem. My sis was on the line accusing him of going into her room the night before and trying to rub on her or something while she slept. He said it was bull, didn't touch her. Said he did go in there because he was upset by something she had said - her opinion that I wouldn't go on vacation with her bc of him. He said he sat on the bed trying to see why she would say that. I knew topic was an issue, he had brought it up to me earlier that day, offended that I may have said something that would make her think that. (I didn't, I was hesitant bc of money)

Anyway, my sis could hear me get upset on the phone and got in her car and was at my house in 5 mins. 

He maintained he'd never touch her like that. She was insisting he did. They are both looking at me as judge/jury. I left for a walk, middle of the night to clear my head. 

Next day, my sister told me that she called him that night to tell him, wow we must've smoked some bad weed or something, as a way to blow it off. She said he completely denied it and then I was brought in. The more he denied it, the madder she got. To the point where she made it sound like he violated her. It just didnt make sense to me - they hardly even tolerate each other. Right or wrong,  I did nothing. She was intoxicated and has been known to have wild dreams and hallucinations while under the influence. Sis mentioned that day at lunch that she was so high night before that she had weird dreams.

After, she asked weren't you going to leave him anyway? (I'd pondered if we were in a rut or growing apart after a fight with him, she joked she'd move in our new house with me and my son) She didn't speak to me for months because I didnt leave him. He hasn't been to family events now for a very long time because she will be there. She won't come to my house. For the record, my parents believe him. But keep the peace with her.

Last night I craved for a chicken sandwich with chilli (yumm~) and I asked my mother in law whether she wanted any. She said no she wasn't hungry and since my husband doesn't eat at that time, I only made one.

I quickly gobbled it up and when my mother in law came into the kitchen again, the plate was already wiped clean. She asked me in shock you're done that fast?! I was pretty embarrassed and told her it's my favorite. Then she said and you didn't think to at least offer people staying in the house with you a bite? I was confused and told her but you said you weren't hungry and Jake (my husband) doesn't eat at this hour. 

She said you didn't think to store some in the fridge in case I DO get hungry?! I told her I'm sorry I really didn't think that far ahead. I'll make a new one. But then I remembered that we were all out of chilli and sheepishly told her imma go buy some. She told me not to bother but I insisted. 

But even after looking at several convenience stores, I couldn't find the brand I was looking for and since it was nearly midnight by then, I didn't have many options. I called Jake and asked him what I should do and he told me to just get one from a snack near us.

When I got home though and brought it to my mother in law, she refused to eat it and said I told you to forget it I don't eat takeout. She insisted she didn't want it nor did she want anything else, that she had just smelled the chilli earlier and wanted a bite.

I told her okay if you need anything let me know. I went back to the kitchen and..... ate that sandwich too. The next day, Jake and I wake up to find mother in law gone with a text sent to my husband that says she won't be putting her foot in our house ever again for the amount of disrespect I showed her. Apparently she did get hungry later and went looking for the sandiwch and couldn't find it.

Jake was livid that I ate that one too and told me this is my fault and I should go with him to apologize to her. I got angry too and told him why couldn't she have just asked directly instead of going around all these circles in the first place? He ignored me and grabbed his jacket and keys and left.

Since the start of the year I (15m) have started tutoring sessions with my uncle and the best way I could describe it is... boring and like hell at best. We constantly get into arguments because I'm not going to lie I am often late to these sessions by usually a minute or two and I understood that could be frustrating so I really made it a effort to be atleast 5 minutes early from there but that's not the only thing. Once he saw me wearing a cross in the household and we are strict Muslims I wore it because my friend found it and gave it 2 me and I just wanted to see how it looked but long story short my parents found it and a huge yelling session breaks out and he goes and tells two uncles about it which then the rest of the family learns. Today was hell I got woken up at 6:40 because my mom was asking why I didn't give the cross back and I explained that I didn't even know where it was and so she did apologize and did feel bad however I couldn't sleep from then I had already been woken up 3 times prior so I tried getting some sleep and then I woke up at 10:09 from the vibration on my phone for being late to my 10 am tutoring session. I explained that I'm sorry and that I had a rough night of sleep he still asked me to come over and I did despite it being pouring rain right now its only a 2 minute walk but I was tired angry and hungry I still went he says it's canceled today and that I can come back tommorow. I was upset that he made me walk here just to tell me something he could have just texted me over so I said ""let's just cancel these"" he said why I then said ""Because I hate doing two 45 minute sessions every single day from Monday to Sunday and from 10 am on weekends ontop of highschool and language class"" then I started speaking on how I hate how he tells everyone everything I do. I have a issue with lying it started when I noticed If I lied I just wouldn't have to deal with people but its gotten bad however I genuinely try to not and I would say I have made very good progress however any information I get mistaken for I just get called a compulsive liar and he goes and texts everyone that I'm such a compulsive liar etc. He just says he doesn't tell anyone anything which is a lie my mom showed me him speaking about me and I didn't say anything because I don't really care anymore.

however he is very addicted to his phone. he loves twitter and is on it in most of his spare moments. don’t get me wrong i absolutely love twitter and am on it more than most, but with dennis it seems to be genuinely a problem. 

when he goes on twitter he is completely immersed in it, you can’t talk to him. i think he completely dissociates from the room he is in. to the point where we have spoke  about how he sometimes ignores me when i am talking to him which upsets me. 

twice this week we have been sat in the living room with his housemates (dan 22, evan24 ) and dennis has been in his twitter world, so i have been talking to his housemates (who i am good friends with), and have been talking when suddenly dennis snaps out of his world and comments about a tweet he’s just seen. except he spoke over me as i was talking. he didn’t notice and then snapped back into his twitter world. 
this has happened three times and it hurts every time. 
i brought it up to him last night in a way i thought was calm and just told him it upset me. he got defensive saying that he “obviously doesn’t mean to do that” and he can’t really stop doing it .

As a result of this, and also because it can be difficult for me to concentrate and follow long narratives, I always watch the television with subtitles on. I have since I was a young child (my mum used to take me to get hearing tests before my diagnosis!). 

I was hanging out with my friends today and they were putting on this film which is quite complex. We usually watch things with subtitles on, they know that I need them on and it’s never been mentioned as an issue before. This wasn’t a film that needed suspense or anything so it wouldn’t be spoiled by subtitles. For some reason, when my friend went to put this film on, they said ‘you know what, I’m going to turn the subtitles off because they’re annoying’. I asked them to keep them on, and explained that I won’t be able to follow it without them. They said ‘well you can follow a conversation when someone is talking to you so I don’t know why this is any different’ and refused to put them back on. I again tried to explain that I literally won’t know what’s going on for the whole film if the subtitles aren’t on, and they just ignored me and put the remote on the side. 

I felt really confused by this especially as my other friends weren’t really saying anything. It was really awkward. I stood up and said that I was going to leave then as I didn’t really want to sit and watch a film for hours when I couldn’t understand what was going on. The main dude just kinda shrugged, I said goodbye properly to my friends and then left. 

I feel like I don’t know how to really go about this. I’m sure that my friend thought I was being unreasonable and difficult but I didn’t intend to be. I don’t know if I’m the asshole for expecting all of my friends to sit through a film with subtitles on my behalf, or for leaving and making things awkward about this. But I also don’t really know what else I could have done, because I genuinely would have just been incredibly bored and confused for two hours straight.

I don't have much of a relationship with her as she isn't a pleasant person. I don't know Marissa's birthday and don't see why I would be expected to, but my wedding ended up falling on her birthday.

When my dad found out the date, I could tell he was stressed. He said she has a lot of trauma and he feels so guilty spending her birthday at my wedding. I didn't say much and figured they could work it out.

Well the wedding was last weekend. I'm not sure if Marissa was upset or not. She is very very stoic so idk, but my dad kept apologizing. When they first arrived and he came to see me in the bridal room he brought her for some reason, and as they walked in I could hear him saying sorry and asking if she was ok. Right before the ceremony he had her on his lap and was whispering but I could hear it. He was saying he wished she would open her birthday presents and she was like I just don't want to do it today. then he said what if she opens them and he buys new ones for the day they celebrate. Then my grandma came over and tried to give her a gift and he was just so annoying about it.

Final straw was during the reception. Marissa was complaining to my grandma how she hates chocolate cake (only cake we had) and my dad took her in his arms and was asking if she wanted to go out later and get something, and again apologized.

I finally snapped and yelled at him if my wedding was such a burden take the child he is dating and get the fuck out (I meant because of her actions, there isn't a big age gap) He looked horrified and I was like well go. My grandma immidiatley began to berate me that I am awful and he paid for the wedding. He asked if i really wanted him to go, and I told him to either shut the fuck up about her birthday or go.

last year in our first year of uni she started hanging out with a new group of friends and she kinda “forgot” about me. she would hang out with them every single day while leaving me on delivered or read for hours on end, pretty much replying maybe once a day after a certain point. that bothered me for the first few months but shortly afterwards i started dating one of my friends and didn’t really care that much anymore. also before anyone asks no i was never invited to hang out with them as a group.

since then we’ve been hanging out and being in contact a lot more, but certainly not back to how we used to be in high school. other minor things that have rubbed me off the wrong way have happened but i’m not sure they’re worth mentioning. 

something else that she’s always done is being late in our appointments. i’m an extremely punctual person and i usually have to wait for her for half an hour or more. a few weeks ago we planned a coffee date (i let her pick the time in hopes that she would show up on time) and she was an hour late. i let her know how annoyed i was and she said she would be better from them on but nothing else has been planned since. 

so that friend group i mentioned earlier? they still hang out- just not as often. apparently two of the girls were dating and they recently broke up. my friend made out with one of them at a party a few days after the breakup. she told me she felt really bad doing that with one of her best friends exes. the two girls then got back together. my friend met with the girl to clear things up and they ended up making out again. they’ve been texting back and forth ever since. i told her she should stop but she didn’t despite saying she would. now the girl is leaving her on read and delivered while posting stories with her gf and she’s having breakdowns over that, saying how guilty and stupid she feels, but still refusing to cut contact with her. 

all this to say, would i be an asshole to stop hanging out with her? that is, not proposing any plans, not agreeing to anything she might propose and gradually reducing the frequency of texting.

We took in the guy because of something’s happening in his life and he needed a place to stay. We stated how could stay as long as he helped with chores and buying himself food. As well as finding a job. Fast forward a few months and this friend let’s call her Sarah wanted to move out and find a new place. We offered her to move in with us to a new place when our lease was up. Overall it turned out a bad idea letting Sarah and Jack stay with us. They didn’t help with chores and when asked they would disappear for hours coming home late at night. They also brought a pet into the apartment and left it home for hours. They also did not take care of the animal properly leaving me and my boyfriend to clean up after it as well as feed it. In the end me and my boyfriend decided they should just leave because of they way they were treating our belongings and running up our bills and not offering to chip in on the costs. So it’s a few months from then and I found out Sarah was telling everyone I just kicked her out for no reason and I was a terrible person for just kicking them out with no notice. I did ask them to leave but I never said they had to take everything right that moment just that they can’t stay here anymore. So I decided to call her mom and ask how she was doing because I haven’t heard from her in a few months. I did tell Sarah’s mother the truth on why she left our place and she was upset she wasn’t told anything. This was a bad idea. Sarah texts me yelling at me for contacting her mother. She told me I’m a horrible friend for thinking she would want anything to do with me after I kicked her out. In end I cut off contact with her completely but now she’s mad at me for calling her mother. So am I the asshole for calling her mom to check in on her? 

Edit: Jack was kicked out of his prior home, unemployed, and just played video games all day. He also stole from us and used our personal items without asking. I also did not find out Jack and Sarah were secretly together until a week before they were asked to leave.

We were deciding between moving to our second property for that duration or to rent another place while renting out that second place of ours. My wife's father insisted that we come over and stay with them so as not to waste unnecessary money on rent.

I wasn't keen on that as my FIL due to a rather tense relationship. I'm not sure if he was always trying to talk me down or had insecurities of his own etc. When my wife and I started dating, he scoffed at my arts degree as useless etc. I ended up on a lucrative career and sold a co-owned start up, He then would made snide remarks about me being a show off because I drove a nice car, told my wife I definitely was selling drugs outside etc. 

So anyhow, my wife convinced me that was all in the past and I agreed once I had assurances that our living habits did not clash with theirs. For one, I have a husky who I kept in a climate-controlled area at home as we live in a hot tropical climate. I offered to pay rent and that was rejected. My wife also confirmed they were ok with me leaving the AC on for my dog. The whole discussion was basically between my wife and him. 

Soon after moving in, my FIL either found out what I really meant or had a change of heart. He went on a rant about how wasteful it was to leave the AC on for my dog since it was just a dog etc. He was fine with us having the AC on when we were around but couldn't stand it being left on for my dog.

I probably let slip of my tongue in my irritation and said the additional hour or 2 of AC being left on while we were out didn't cost much and I offered to pay that increase, if not our half of the utilities bill. FIL went on a tangent insisting this isn't about money and accused me of being a douchebag once I had money. He then stated that since we were living in his house, we should be grateful and live by their rules.

I lost it and reminded him that it was him who insisted that we stay over and at no point did I ever request to move in as I could very well afford my own accommodation.

I met him along our group of friends when we were respectively 13 and 15 and started dating about a few months later. 

I broke up with him in early October this year because I considered his behavior completely disrespectful. For a very brief summary, while I considered the possibility of having an open relationship (after he showed interest in one), he fell in love with another girl but I turned down the idea asap, as I felt completely uncomfortable with that. We decided to try and solve this situation but we had a party with the other girl and I felt like his behavior too disrespectful to tolerate that, especially after having tried to have several conversations with him about it that led to nothing. 

After about a month of radio silence, except for a conversation or two that ended sourly, we had to spend time together as my friends from aboard came to visit us for my birthday. They stayed for a weekend at his place and as he seemed to ignore me as much as he could and our friends seemed uneasy about the tension, I had decided to have a very long conversation with him. We had concluded that we could start being friends, especially as I was one of the few people who he confined about having depression and he believed I could help with that. He had tried to ask me for ""another chance"" but I refused and made it clear that I had no interest in starting a relationship with him again, especially since there was a mutual interest with my current boyfriend [22M] at that time. My ex was aware of that, and even told me he was supportive. 

Things were doing somewhat fine, having a lot of meaningful conversations while hanging out with our friends too during that weekend, he asked me a week later to visit him at his place because he was feeling ""lonely"". He was trying to be constantly busy. 

We got caught in an argument as he also admitted to trying to win me back again. I explicitly told him that it was plain disrespectful towards both my boyfriend and I and he gave me an ultimatum : either I get back with him and he stays with us, or he left. I asked him if he possibly could stay in the group and I was the one leaving, because he empathized how much our group of friends helped him with his depression and I was certain I could stay in touch with them despite not really spending time with them anymore. He refused. 

He didn't want anything to do with me anymore, and as I didn't anything of that sort with him either, I left his apartment and he blocked everyone in the process.

I have a friend, Grace(18F) we are the same age, for a long while she had been friends with my sister too(15F) and this is not a problem at all, they are both very outgoing people and are similar to each other.

She is sure of herself, beautiful, has a lot of hobbies and talents but tends to be arrogant sometimes, or tends to judge other people's works but can't take a single comment that is not positive on her's, or tends to be judging about stuff that she does all the time too.

I've told this to her countless times and always had been very friendly and sociable to other people in these places also to show it to her, but she often says that I get sleepy or something like that, which is very far from true.

Took maybe 15min.
When I was done, I found him in my living room perusing an old childhood diary. Or journal? You know, with cringy poems and bad drawings from when I was like 12-13yo. Nothing bad or too weird but stuff I never showed to anyone. I got mad. Said I do not appreciate him reading that. He said he was sorry right away. Did not want to make me feel bad. That he saw nothing too personal, was not really reading... more, like, looking at it... That it was right there on the bookshelf.
And it is true; it's right there in your face. Perhaps I should not have left something that personal in such an accessible spot but AITA to be mad and rethinking the relationship?

It’s hard to get advice at times without judgement of our situation getting in the way.
My partner has gestational diabetes requiring insulin among other issues. It has been advised that she may need to induced 2 weeks early if the diabetes causes baby not to grow as he should. 
Our maternity doctors have strongly advised that any adult who might regularly come in contact with our baby in the first 6 month, should be required to get a whopping cough vaccine.
Upon mentioning this expectation to our friends/family at large, some have unfortunately refused and insisted it isn’t necessary. 
I’m not sure if this is a general reaction or if it is due to the fact that we are both women. 
We have now told everyone that if they won’t adhere to this very simple request, they cannot be around our newborn child until he has had all the necessary immunisations.
We are now getting a lot of hate for this and told that we are being ridiculous and silly.

They gave me the prices for several options, and I placed my order for five tires. I wrote down the price that I was quoted.

When I went to the shop, all five tires were installed to my satisfaction. But when I went to pay, the total was several hundred dollars less than I expected. I said to the store manager, who was also the person I had spoken to on the phone, “Is that all?  I thought you said it would be more?”  “I did say that, ma’am, but it turned out to cost me less, so you pay less.”

I didn’t keep arguing, and went to Home Depot and bought an expensive tool that I had been wanting. In my household, cars and tools are in the same budget category. That night, I took the tool out of the package and used it.  THE NEXT DAY, the manager called me to say that he’d made a mistake, that they only meant to take $10 off per tire, not to take several hundred off of the order, and would I come in and “make it right”.  

My response was, “I warned you that the price was wrong and you gave me a response that it was on purpose! I already spent the money on something else.”  I didn’t go back and pay any extra. The owner called me and said he would take the money out of the manager’s pay, but I still didn’t go back and pay.

My neighbor said that it was illegal to take money from the employee’s pay in Ontario, and that the owner was just lying. He also said that I was in the clear from a legal standpoint because once you pay the amount demanded and a receipt has been issued, the transaction is finished. But my other neighbor said, politely, you do have other money, so your argument about having spent the money is moot.

I'm not going to get into that here but we've had issues lately and haven't been on speaking terms for a while. We've been best friends our whole lives though.

&amp;#x200B;

Before we stopped speaking her mom passed away. It was really sad for me too because she was like a second mom to me. My friend has tons of pictures of her but not many videos or recordings of her voice. She has a few but not much. I was going through my phone to delete stuff I didn't need and found a super long video of her mom talking. I invited her over and we watched it together. Shortly after that we stopped talking and there is anger towards each other.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved the video of her mom to my google drive and sent her the link. Since we haven't been talking she hasn't even opened the message and it didn't say it was ""seen."" Just because we aren't talking didn't mean I didn't want her to have access to the video. But the video is long and large and takes up a little over half the space available in my drive. I knew she wasn't checking my messages so I asked a mutual friend to tell her that this is the footage of her mom . Shortly after that I saw the message was ""seen."" In the message I said that I am going to delete the file shortly after I see that she's seen it because I need the space. She didn't reply but she saw it. I contacted the mutual friend and was told that she saw the message and was told that it was the video of her mom and that i'd be deleting it soon.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks after she saw the message I deleted the video and then months later(now) I get a pissed of text from her. She's telling me how I am a bitch for deleting the footage of her mom and that she didn't even download it yet. I told her that the message was seen and our friend told you. She said ""I didn't read that shit"" and when our friend was talking about me she just ignored her and was nodding and saying okay.

She expressed a willingness to keep the baby if we both raise the child and that is the problem here, that has become our disagreement. She wishes for us to end the affair and become a couple and I have told her that is not what we agreed we were starting, when I told her I never had any thoughts of leaving my fiancé she took it very badly. 

There is some disclosure needed here, my fiancé knows all about her and all about the pregnancy and agrees with me that it is time to end the affair. I wasn't the one cheating on my soon to be spouse but it is very quickly becoming messy because the woman I am seeing is now in a position none of us (me, her and my fiancé) expected would happen. 

I have tried contacting her again to find out if there is more to this regarding the abortion and how she really feels about that but she won't answer and won't respond, I have not been blocked and I can see she is reading them so I'm hopeful she will come around and we try again to talk about this. 

I really don't know what else to do if I'm being honest, both me and my fiancé are concerned for her and we do love her.

My (33) daughter E(11) was attacked coming home from the park yesterday. She is ok physically apart from a little pain however she was very emotional and distressed obviously. 

Working from home I immediately went to comfort her as she went straight to her bedroom crying. Mom spoke to a teacher who intervened and followed her home in their car to ensure she was safe. 

Whilst I got the bare details such as the name of one of her attackers my partner rang that child's dad and started shouting at him in a rage. 

I feel that she acted completely irrationally and was more interested in revenge than comforting her daughter. 

We got into an argument. I said it seemed like she was more interested in revenge than comforting our daughter and that she had completely lost it.  She interpreted my words as saying I was accusing her of not caring. 

My point is that she did not 
A. Comfort our child and left it to me. 
B. Did not immediately check for any serious injuries with me. 
C.Take a moment to think
D. Made things harder to deal with.

I would do it again for some of my family.

Background: My sister is introverted to the point where if she was slightly more introverted, she'd come full circle and be a total extrovert. I once went 6 weeks without seeing her, despite living 10 minutes away and only called the police because I mistook a dead raccoon smell under her porch for dead sister smell. Turns out she was just doing a lot of art. My parents were mad at me for disturbing her because ""I know how she is."" I do know, as my entire family is introverted and we all need space to recharge, but she takes/took it to a whole new level

Recently she confided in me that many of the times she ""disappeared"" like that wasn't due to her doing hobbies or whatnot, she was extremely depressed and spending 20 hours a day in bed. During the pandemic, she read about microdosing to help with depression and anxiety. What I didn't know is that while mushrooms are illegal federally and in most states, the purchase of spores (seeds for fungi) is not. She converted a closet into her mushroom grow room and has been taking them almost daily. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SHE WAS NOT SELLING. She told me this in private, but brought it up at Thanksgiving. My SIL unfortunately heard it.

Sister in Law and her younger brother were under 10 when their older brother OD'd and died in front of them when he was supposed to be babysitting. She has grown to hate all forms of drugs and her younger brother is now a Federal Agent (he is NOT DEA but works closely with them from time to time). Their feelings/motivations for doing so are completely understandable to me.

My sister did not know this because she spends a lot of time away from the family. SIL exploded on my sister and myself for knowing and not ""doing anything about it."" She left almost immediately. So the next day I filled my sister in and we decided to move her grow stuff to my house just in case. We were right to do that, because three days later she and a friend were at my place hanging out and decided to run to the store. My sister forgot her phone, but her friend texted me ""we got pulled over, Katie (sister) is under arrest and apparently they're searching her house."" Without responding, the entire grow room removed itself. Her phone decided to physically disassemble and destroy itself. I drove around doing errands while pieces of it happened to fall out of my car window across the entire county.

Two days later, knock on MY door. Long story short, they find nothing, my SIL explodes on the entire family over this.

I (30f) have a mom (51f) who I love dearly despite her not being the best. When I say ""not being the best"" I don't mean she was directly or purposely harmful to me, she just had a lot of mental health issues that prevented her from being the most present parent. The most responsible and loving thing that she could do for me was give my dad (57m) primary custody and didn't fight the courts recommendation for supervised visits until I was a teen. 

Without fail my mom always showed up to my birthdays, gave me presents and called me on holidays, and went to as much events as she could for me. While I was sad that my mom wasn't around all the time my parents always made sure I knew that it wasn't my fault and that my mom was just ""sick."" I never really had an issue with that explanation until ""Tamara"" (30f) made fun of me for not having a mommy who loved me enough to want me. In her world when parents split up the mom always got the kids unless she didn't love them. 

That's how it started in Elementary school and then Tamara started bullying me for other things. I used to come home crying multiple times and my dad went to the school with this issue repeatedly, but since none of the adults were around when Tamara's ""alleged"" bullying happened there wasn't much that was done. For the longest time my mom didn't know about any of this because dad feared that she would make it worse. However when my mom saw how visibly upset I was, I broke down and told her everything. My hair was the result of Tamara ""accidentally"" spilling a mix of glue and blue paint on top of my head. 

My mom was very calm and comforting the whole time and asked me for Tamara's full time and any other description that I could give of her, her parents, and the type of car they drove. My dad eventually was able to get me over to another school and the following year my mom paid for me, my dad, and her to go to ""Mouse World"" in Florida. I never saw or heard from Tamara again until recently when she and I discovered that her boyfriend was living in the same apartment complex as me. 

Tamara recognized me immediately and confronted me about how my mom and I ""ruined"" her life. I had no idea what she was talking about and Tamara told me that my mom had an affair with Tamara's dad and revealed it at Tamara's birthday party. I didn't believe her and just walked away, then when I told my mom about it she admitted to everything and even said that the money she used to pay for our family trip came from Tamara's dad. I was shocked. 

I did some digging and apparently Tamara's parents had a bitter divorce, were forced to sell the house, and to this day Tamara feels a certain level of dread around her birthday.

My college gives me 6 guest tickets. I’ve already decided on my parents, my sister, and my maternal grandma to come which leaves me with 2 tickets left.

Here’s the issue. Out of the 2 remaining tickets, I want to give one to my middle school teacher who has become like a second mother to me since I left. I always pictured her being at these big life events with me. I told my mom this and I thought she would understand since they are actually pretty close as well. She got mad at me because she thinks I should invite my paternal grandmother in my teacher’s place.

Truth be told, some things went down a few years ago between me &amp; her and now I don’t really have any love left for my paternal grandmother. I don’t communicate with her anymore and I pass on trips where one of the stops is her house. Bottom line: I don’t want her at my graduation.

My mom just starts on a whim about the fact that I have a living grandmother and she should be there at the graduation because she’s family. I’m also being accused of passing on family to give a ticket to an outsider. Honestly, my old teacher feels a lot more like family than my grandmother ever did.

I just feel like it’s my graduation and I should decide who I want there and who I don’t. I really don’t know why she’s making a big deal out of this since she knows what went down and why I won’t go down there or speak to my pat. grandmother anymore.

I am also a non binary person in relationships with two men. I was born male but I identify as non binary.

This of course is frustrating and gross. So I’ve taken it upon myself to fuck with them a bit. I play along with their little roleplay, I ask them what they’d do to me, and the moment they ask for nudes, a pic of my ass, etc, I send them the most gratuitous picture of my dick as possible. After this they immediately ghost me most of the time but some of them have expressed anger and frustration that I “tricked” them

So, i regularly take my 3 year old on a walk to the woods, or around the fields / park. We're in quite a rural area with alot of dog walkers so naturally there are ALOT of dogs to see and honestly i love it but i don't nor do i let my little one pet them unless they are offlead, happily coming up to us and i check with the owners.

Ive taught my 3 year old that when dogs are on walks we do not disturb them. They are an absolute no go when they're on a lead and offlead we always ask first and let them approach us, never follow them. The dogs and their humans are doing their thing, we are doing ours. We can wave, say how cute or handsome they are, talk about their fluffiness etc but we keep walking.

This has prompted some confusion from friends and family, some say its like going to a shop and not getting anything, others have said I'm abit mean for not letting my 3 year old enjoy the dogs on our walks (i mean, they're not our dogs to enjoy and honestly i do if its a completely relaxed situation like i mentioned) i just feel its a good rule of thumb for safety and well... they're walking their dogs... i don't think someone wants to be stopped all the time 🤷‍♀️ like i said, if it looks like a relaxed walk, the dog is offlead friendly and approaching us not us approaching them then i will ask the owner before we indulge in some good pats but otherwise i stand firm in my decisions however...

While planning meals we decided to include my sisters husbands family and everyone was going to get together at his parents house for Christmas Eve. At the last minute (the day of the dinner) we ended up not being able to go because there was a misunderstanding between my sister and her mother in law, apparently my sister was not clear that we (my family) were coming and her husband’s sister was not comfortable with more because of covid.  Fair enough, they went and my sister came home early, while her husband and daughter returned later.  

Then late Christmas morning my sister and her family briefly leave to go to his parents house again, but this time to open gifts, say bye to his sister and her husband.  His parents live a couple blocks away in should mention. 

Christmas dinner is at my sisters house and her husbands mom and dad come.  They usually do each year and I’m ok with that, just was butt hurt over the night before still. 

Fast forward to this year and my sister wants us to come again so I asked her if she was planning to leave us alone again like last year.  Her answer was basically yes they were planning on Christmas Eve again at her in-laws, and Christmas dinner at her house.  

I suggested both dinners at her house so we could be included and she says she doesn’t want the work of two dinners.  I offered to help, said we could potluck but that didn’t sway.  I think it may be more my sister’s husband’s sister, and her husband that do not want to have a multi family gathering.

When I tell my sister that I don’t like the idea of them leaving us alone again at their house she says things like “we can’t not go to their house for Christmas, we do every year” or she said she thought my “family would appreciate the alone time together”. 

I am really disappointed, we barely see each other as it is because of busy schedules.

So my gf is 22 and im 21 M. It was her birthday the other day and as we were talking on the phone we were going through the people who posted her on their IG stories and she was explaining to me who each person was (I'm LDR with her at the moment so don't know most these people). 

Anyway, one guy who is her friend, and I believe obviously, is a model, and I thought he was homosexual, however my girlfriend explained that he's bisexual, which makes me think maybe there was some attraction, I'm not sure. Anyway, I saw her comments on his ig posts (he does modelling) some said like ""the handsomest"" or ""the most handsome!!"" and it made me quite sad, because I felt like now when she says it to me, it will have less value as she says it to other guys too. 

I tried to tell her that it made me a bit upset because I thought I would be in your eyes and now that compliment feels no longer special, but she went silent on me and refused to talk about it too much. She told me she was stressed from birthday planning and other things and she thought I was being irrational.  We haven't spoken for hours now.

We were the do-everything-together kind of best-friends until I was no-fault-evicted (Section 21 UK law) and had to move a few miles away. A few months later she moved a few miles in the opposite direction, putting us at about 50 minutes drive from each other. We see each other every couple of months for a few days at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my partner and I have once again been section 21ed. *(If I'm a terrible terrible person I'm unaware of it)*. This time we have the problem that we cannot afford to rent anywhere locally, anymore. We have not succeeded in registering with the council. Our only option is to move to a cheaper area of the UK, which unfortunately means my partner having to leave his job. We decided to move near to his parents, in Scotland.

&amp;#x200B;

My best-friend doesn't want us to move away. She is my only proper friend in this area; she and her husband have a couple more friends, and family, but not a huge support network either. Her family lives in the South, so she feels she relies on me heavily, even though we don't see each other often.

&amp;#x200B;

My other half applied for a couple of jobs near where we would move to in Scotland. This is when best-friend started getting sulky. We applied for a few houses, but were turned down. This week though, we think we have sorted one out. So, with this burden relieved, I told her I thought we were secure. 

&amp;#x200B;

She won't talk to me now; I received a mouthful from her husband on Facebook Messenger, telling me that I am being really ungrateful for all the work she's been doing looking at houses and sending me listings. She isn't thinking of what we need when she looks at properties though. I understand that she wants me nearby, but the properties that she suggests are completely out of our price range, especially given that in order to move to them my partner would have to leave his job, but only just (ie, they're \*just\* too far to commute).

Am I the unreasonable one here?

So you can look at the last post or get the summary below. I was also messaged not to argue so I won’t do that again. 

I used to play video games as a kid, like 25 years ago- original PS. Then RE2 remake came out and I loved so I got a PS4 and 5. It really reminded me why I played as a kid. So now I get a game like 1-2 times a year. The last game I played thru was HZD FW in February ‘22. 

My wife (37F) gets irritated when I play because I have to finish it. Over Thanksgiving break (10 days for me) I put in 59 hours. We do have a toddler (2) and older teenagers (who are mostly self sufficient). But I still cooked Thanksgiving dinner for 8, cook 6 days a week, and wake up with our toddler when it’s my turn. 

I feel like it’s ok since I rarely ever play and when I do I really enjoy it. She disagrees.

I’m a 21F living with a 20M, he’s a close friend and we’ve been living together for almost 6 months, and have the option of extending our lease in January for a year. However I’m very apprehensive because we seem to have a fair few difficulties living together. 

I essentially mother him in all aspects of our living arrangement. I do the bills, I communicate with the landlords etc. I have to ask him to clean up after himself, or just participate in regular upkeep of the house. It’s gotten to the point where he’s left dishes out for so long that they’ve grown mould on them. 

I suppose it would be easy to just ask “why wouldn’t you do them if he left them there for so long?”. It’s more that I’m trying very hard to not perpetuate this idea that he can rely on me for all these things. It’s made me so stressed out, and I feel like I have this responsibility in the back of my mind constantly. Like having to tell him to do his dishes, or take the bins out, or not leave his clothes all over the floor. 

We’ve had numerous conversations about this. We communicate very effectively, like we never yell or anything, but it’s gotten to the point where I feel so used and mistreated in our friendship that I don’t see much potential resolution. 

I work 3-4 days a week 9-5, whilst he works 2 shifts a week 3pm-11pm. I also just finished full time uni, yet feel like I have had to take the majority of the household burden in spite of me having the most responsibilities outside of the house. He spends the vast majority of his time on the computer, which is fine, but can become a little bit annoying when I come home and his dishes aren’t done or he’s left mess all over the bench. 

I also have severe OCD, and have told him that it is really important that he ensures the house is safe. Otherwise my OCD gets triggered and my compulsions become exacerbated. He has left the oven/ stove top on multiple times, and has left the back gate open which meant my cat could have escaped. It has stressed me out so significantly.

I have spoken to some friends, and the only reason I’m suggesting I have precedence over him staying in the house January onwards is because I have a cat. Thus, it makes it 10x harder for me to find a place that would allow a cat when compared to him who can easily just find a place without having to worry about that. I would obviously help him move. But like I said it has reached the point where I feel like there is no resolution. I have tried so many times, and he has given me so many empty promises and excuses.

So I have the feeling that when I go in today that he’s going to try to say something about this and I’m going to have to stand up for myself that I can’t chase change down after store hours especially when it’s his job to ensure change is available for the store.
