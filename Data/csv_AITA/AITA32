She has a kid and was trying to live on her own. I didn’t see anything wrong with it as she was over the apartment multiple times anyways. 

After she moved in, I had to call the cops on her and the baby’s father five times in less than a year. The first occurrence, she left me in the apartment with an irate man and her crying baby while she sought safety from him. He even attempted to break down our front door. After this issue, she was informed he was no longer welcomed into the home. 

There’s been many times to where she’s snuck him in. She thought I had no clue but you can tell when there’s another person in the apartment. I’ve called her out it a few times but it continued to happen. Cops were called after he was being combative.

She had another guy over who brought a random friend with him. She informed me that they were coming over and the friend would be in the living room. I walked out in the living room and there was no one there. To this day, I don’t know where that person was as our apartment has two floors. 

She informed me that the guy she was talking to showed her a weapon when they were hanging out last time. While I was in the apartment, I heard them arguing and immediately feared for my safety.

I bought a flight to my family’s house and stayed there for a week. Upon returning, there was a person in the apartment without my knowledge. She tried to hide the person with a blanket, as if I couldn’t see their shoes. She then says he wasn’t decent and undressed. I told her that I had enough and would be terminating the lease. I informed our property manager and he’s terminating the lease for me due to safety concerns. 

I’m now receiving texts from her saying it’s horrible of me to assume that it was the guy who was not welcomed in the apartment. I should’ve asked who was there, and give her a chance to save up to find another place since the holidays are coming up. She didn’t qualify to keep the apartment herself so she also has to move. She then blamed me for her not having her finances together. In my opinion if you’re rooming with someone, this is the perfect time to save. She wasn’t saving at all.

My property has also been damaged such as furniture. It was in new condition and now it was so damaged I had to pay to get it removed.

I don’t feel bad or guilty for terminating the lease as she has demonstrated disrespect multiple times. I shouldn’t have to give her a heads up that I’m coming back to the apartment and especially don’t have to knock to enter my own home. My safety is my number one concern and I shouldn’t have to fear for my life while being in an apartment.

I (F28) and my twin sister V (f28) were born to a teen mom who raised us the best she could but lead us both to having very different ways of dealing with abandonment and an unstable home life.
My mom has a very strained relationship with V since when she was 17 she started doing many different substances, partying alcohol and smoking. I being her sister always tried my best supporting her, as my mother did, but I was more a best friend whereas my mom was the one to force her to sort her life out, rehab etc.
I on the other hand turned out to be very obsessed with having control and structure in my life which has made it very difficult for me to maintain romantic relationships as I can be controlling and paranoid with abandonment.
Cut forward to when I went to uni, V found herself in a very bad toxic relationship and practically cut off my mother which severed their relationship entirely. She eventually got pregnant and gave birth to my nephew in my second year at uni.
After struggling with romantic partners all my life and having very short term boyfriends, I met my ex fiancé (let’s call him D) who I genuinely thought I’d met the one. During this time V had broken up with her toxic ex and was now a single mother, so me and D would have her and my nephew over most weekends.
I however fell pregnant and a year after my daughter was born D proposed. I had never been happier for starting my family.
We decided to wait a year to get married and genuinely enjoyed our new family life.
However one weekend I decided to go see my mother and spend the day with her and my daughter, but we came home early since my mother became busy.
When I arrived home I saw V’s car outside which wasn’t unusual and went inside, nothing would have prepared me for what I would find.
V and D were alone together in my bedroom on my bed. It seemed like the deed had already been done.
I went straight to packing for me and my daughter and left. I gave D no chance for excuses, and cut both of them out of my life entirely except for allowing D visitation to our daughter.

Jump forward three years I have barely spoken to V, except for when she pops back up into my life to apologise or explain, but I don’t care. There is no excuse she could give me.
I am now engaged to my beautiful fiancé M and he loves my daughter and me more than I could ever imagine.
Although my mother is now begging me to invite my sister to my wedding coming up in June, saying to put the past in the past, since my mother has been able to forgive her and mend their relationship.
I refuse which has caused tension, she’s telling me this may be the only way to fix our bond and for my daughter to have her aunt and cousin back.

We’ll do like, “what [insert tv-show] character are you most like?”. And my friend, lets call her Amanda, was going one of those. She asked the rest of us if she was an optimist or a pessimist, I assume it was a question that appeared on the quiz. And I said that that’s totally up to her to decide as she’s the only one who really knows how she sees the world. 

However our other friend, let’s call her Miranda, looked really skeptic as I said that. So I asked her if she disagreed. She wouldn’t look at me and just kinda shrugged and said “I never said that” and I asked her if she agreed with me then to which I got the same reply. She was acting really weird, kinda muttering and looking away. Something I noticed was that as soon as she turned to our other friends and started talking to them she acted way more upbeat and happy, compared to with me who she barely looked at.

I asked her if I’d done anything wrong and if she was upset at me, and again she wouldn’t look at me, just kinda shrugged and said “no”. At this point I’m getting kinda worried that I really upset her with what I said and so I told her that she can tell me if she’s upset with me. She told me that I’m overthinking it, got really annoyed and did like an angry shrug. I got pretty annoyed and I decided to just drop it. 

However another one of our friends, let’s call her Isa, noticed that I was upset and asked me what was up. I explained that it irritated me that our friend was acting really off with me compared to how she acted with our other friends and that she then said that I was overthinking when I asked her why. Miranda however overheard this and said that she’d heard what I said. I just mimicked her “angry shrug” she’d done earlier and she called me childish. 

I’m super confused as to what happened and why she was acting so off with me. I was thinking of bringing it up with her after school to ask her what I did wrong, but idk. I feel like maybe I was in the wrong for telling Amanda that only she can decide if she’s an optimist or a pessimist. Like, why else would Miranda be upset with me. So maybe it’s better if I just apologise?

So, my girlfriend and I have been living together for the past one year. She's always been jealous of my friends and I never took it seriously when she said she was hyper insecure when I hang out with a friend/colleague. 

I, on the other hand, have only one real friend that I've known since we were in school. Let's call him Noah. He knows me better than anyone else and we are super close. I'd go in the middle of the night if he is in an emergency and I'd hang out with him even if we haven't seen each other for a while. We treasure our friendship a lot and our families are tightly connected. 

My girlfriend isn't a fan of our friendship. I dedicate all my time to my girlfriend. I take her out every day, take care of her and show my love and appreciation. I hang out with my best friend once a week or twice at most. However, I'm in my last year of my masters degree in literature and him and I have common classes. One of the classes discusses erotic segments in asian literature that's been censured nowadays. Last week we were studying at home for the exam and we were taking notes and watching one online course. This is when my girlfriend came into the room, heard we are listening a class about this poetry and she immediately started yelling at me. She said I'm ""sleeping around with men behind her back"" and that she was silly to sleep with a cheater. I was super confused because this was literally the class. 

When Noah went home I asked her what this was all about.(both me and noah are straight, like, we've always been only friends) She said I can't just have friends while she is lonely. To give context, she spends time only with me. Nobody else. 

Yesterday me and Noah had class together and he suggested we go grab books from the library. As we went into the library my girlfriend was there (she doesn't study in my university at all) and she said ""I knew it."" We haven't been talking ever since. Today I went to the mall on my own for something and saw she is walking behind me and hanging out around the mall (after I told her I need time on my own)

Now, I said he could make use of the laptop when I am not using it, because there is nothing worth hiding on there. I only made one request: do not use my laptop for watching porn. Because: one, he has a phone himself, and second, it's my laptop and the idea just makes me uncomfortable.

Everything went fine first, but problem is that my ""friend"" (quoted because I don't really know him that well) had a habit of using drugs and that is returning now. He gives his government support money to speed, which is causing him to do all-nighters for the last two days now.

I don't do any drugs myself, so I go to bed quite early, leaving my laptop downstairs for him to use.Yesterday, I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, and I see him jerking off, laptop on his knees, porn displayed full quality full screen. I was really shocked because we made an agreement and he agreed, plus he didn't even bother to stop when I stood right next to him (he thought I would ""enjoy the view""). I said he can use his own phone, but he simply said I should grow up, I was being silly and unreasonable, and ""besides, I have done it a couple more times with your laptop.. screen didn't burst, did it"".

Today I had to leave the house and took my laptop with me, reminding him of the fact that he misused my trust. He just flipped, saying I keep him from finding a job, learning to play guitar (he watches youtube tutorials) etc.

TL;DR: I keep him from using my laptop without my supervision (me being in the same room) because he misused trust and didn't respect the no-porn-policy.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4803315,public,top,nsfw,"AITA for taking my laptop with me as I go, due to mistrust use?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yykfay/aita_for_taking_my_laptop_with_me_as_i_go_due_to/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,

For context, my mother is Mormon. I have never had any issues with Mormons, they are 85% of the time lovely people, however my mum is a very strict and stubborn women, and contains the belief that her opinion is the only correct one. 

Growing up, my mum caused me a lot of emotional stress and mental health issues. I won’t go into detail, but I was not happy. This got so bad that at the age of 16 I moved out of home. she had disowned me for not wanting to be involved in the Mormon religion. I have never held a grudge against her, as I know that she is a stubborn person. She did not contact me for 3 years, leaving all of my messages on delivered. 

After three years, my sister informed me that she was engaged and that she would love me to attend her wedding, expressing how happy she would be if I attended. I ended up deciding to attend, as I come from a family in which life revolved around family, and I wanted to support my sister, despite previous family issues. 

There was no major drama at the wedding, however attending this event affected my mental health to a large extent. This is not necessarily anyones fault…it was just that seeing family members after such a long time restored a lot of negative emotions from the past that I had spent a lot of time blocking out. Safe to say…I was a wreck for the following month or two. 

Fast forward to a year later. My mum had earlier this year informed me that she was engaged. It had been surprising for me at the time that she had even thought to inform me since she had very rarely contacted me since I had moved out of home at 16 years old. 

Time passed and information about the wedding had been all over the place, from not receiving an official invitation and being expected to know that I was invited and what date to be saving, to the wedding being called off and put back on. I had also received information that I the wedding was being held on the exact weekend on which I had been planning to move house, ready to start my new job. The thought of the move had already been stressing me out a lot since I was moving 4 hours away from my current location and the wedding is being held a 17 hour drive from my current location, meaning that I will need to purchase flights to attend the wedding which will cost a minimum of $400. I am just finishing university, and will already be struggling financially with the move as is. Plus knowing that I will be likely super depressed for a month following the wedding wedding, right when I am about to start my new job is not ideal. 

On the other hand, my mum is super family orientated , and will be likely heartbroken if I do not attend, plus will be infuriated since in the past they have not understood the significant effect that a weekend away from work can have on me.

I’m a 29 year old male who is supposed to talk at an MBA alumni event at the university and program I attended. 

I accepted the invitation to speak at this panel almost a month ago. The purpose of the panel is to help students learn how to enter the world of technology with a business degree. 

I accepted this invitation even though I suffer with social anxiety — I’m actively working on this with a therapist.

The panel organizer and I agreed that she would provide me with the questions to the panel a week before the event. This cooled my nerves because I felt I could prepare some thoughts and answers.

That said, it’s two days before the event, and I still have not received the questions — and I have followed up twice, with no response back. 

I’m not one of those people that can wing public speaking events like this. I am going to be speaking in front of 100+ people, which is hard enough scripted (let alone winging it). 

I have nothing against the organizer—I realize we all have busy lives. But I feel I am being set up to fail and worry that it’s going to push me back personally, if I have a traumatic experience. I looked at speaking at this event as being exposure to my fear, but I feel almost crippled now that I can’t prepare. This might sound like an excuse, but I try to expose myself to speaking events, networking, etc on a regular basis. I will have other opportunities. 

The reason I’m conflicted is that I truly want to help the students. I was once in their shoes — and all I want to do is help them learn about alternative career paths.

Here’s some backstory of why I am hesitant.
Back in 2020 when I graduated my university, I planned on finding a job that has high pay, as I went on and met people to get hired nothing really went as I had hoped it would. It was either I am not good enough or I have bad scores on some classes or I am not man enough for the jobs. So I asked my family members to get me into a job or else I was quite close to living on the streets I couldn’t pay for my necessities. 
As I asked my family members suggested me that i should work for my father. So I he hired me, as I was his assistant/driver/cleaner/cook, I did most of his dirty work as well, whenever he is meeting with his friends he would beat me in front of his friends always telling his friends how much of a failure I am and reminding me that I am not as successful as most of his friends and relatives children. As I worked for him from april 2020 to january of 2022. During that period I was beaten infront of his friends, his wife, in public and at work for being slow, weak, and useless. My father divorced my mother when I was a newborn you could say he was the one who went out for milk and cheated on my mother. So as it was getting closer to december of 2021 he said I am not worthy of being his son, oh and might I add they thought I would steal from them when my dear old man passes away, since we are an Asian family my dear old mans new wife thought I would take all his money with out leaving any for his children. So he kicked me out of my apartment and took my car away since his wife kept telling him to take it since she is more important and he should listen to her and take it away and fire me while he is at it. Right now in the present time my fathers side family members and friends are asking me to go visit him that I am being selfish and not being a good son.

I’m in my 30s and everyone involved are between 30-50. 

About 6 months ago, our unit VP announced his retirement by the end of the year so the company went into search mode. We recently found out our manager will be promoted into the VP position so now his position needs to be filled. Which brings us to my current situation.

I’m single with no kids so I have no other responsibilities except to myself. I really want this position because it’s a visible position and a great stepping stone to my career (as seen by my manager’s promotion) and it’ll almost double my pay. Once we found out about our manager’s promotion, I started to take on extra projects and taking work home. I leave work at my normal hours then work from home until 9 or 10 pm, even on the weekends. All of those extra hours have allowed me to take on harder projects that other people turned down and complete more than anyone else. My manager and the VP have noticed and complimented me on my hustle. My colleagues also noticed my increased production. Last week a work friend asked me how I’m able to do all of those projects in 8 hrs and I told her about my nights and weekends. 

Word got around and this week during our weekly conference call, my colleagues told me to cut it out. They accused me of cheating because I’m putting in the amount of hours they can’t so I’m skewing the production numbers. I refused and don’t think it’s cheating at all and argued they can put in the same amount of hours. Some said they can’t because of family time and others refuse to work hours they won’t get paid for (we’re all on salary). We spent most of the meeting arguing about it.

Her mom is very “religous” and you can fuck off if you don’t fit into every single religious belief she has. 

 violet came out a few years ago saying she liked girls, I was suspicious of mom reaction 

I was absolutely right to be. she did a lot of fucked up shit to my daughter and said some really harmful things. It was typical of what you hear from people like her, she’s going to hell, she’s not normal, she needs to be baptized and see a priest, had her go to church multiple times a week, blocked all girls from her phone, outed her to people in her family, told people in church,  gone as far as to send her paragraphs when she was at school reminding her not to look at girls, she’s crazy, and more, this isn’t all either x 

I hadn’t known this until she slipped up, I divorced her immediately and my daughter now lives with me full time and she only gets visits no sleepovers, no staying at her house and she has pretty much no right to violet. 

Anyways I’ve met my daughters now girlfriend and she comes over frequently, at this time she was going to come over a little later and stay for the weekend and I drop her off. 

However I got a surprise visit from my daughters mom, it was 2 hours before so I told her she can only stay for an hour. She agreed and they talked  for a little while. 

Then her girlfriend ended up coming much earlier than I expected and her mom was still here. 

I told her that she needed to go, and that we will *plan* a visit sometime soon, but I guess she had other plans and said no that she wanted to meet and my kids face said a lot.  I told her that this is a conversation for another day. 

She said that she hasn’t done anything like she did before and she earned the right to meet who her daughter is with. 

 I said she shouldn’t have done it at all and she doesn’t have a right to be here unannounced and she’s lucky she got that. 

She said that I am “holding her past against her” and I’m not allowing her to prove that she’s willing to put her religous facts, behind her. 

All I said was this is not how we are doing this, and she isn’t entitled to anything and is in no position to be making demands. 
We went back and forth with her saying she’s never going to be allowed to prove herself to violet and me saying she needs to try and be a mom to her instead of thinking proving herself is just supporting her sexuality alone. 

She did leave, and I’ve told this to a few of my family member and they’ve said that she deserves to at least prove she can support her. 

While yes at some point she does at this moment wasnt a good time and I would like to sit both of them down including her girlfriends parents before moving forward, and I feel like her thinking just by meeting the girl is a way to prove herself isn’t ideal.

He also is just fucking oblivious to the point its annoying, like he just can’t seem to understand he’s hurting the ppl around him.

He decided to work for one of the classmates that we had in college because he thinks it’s his one way ticket to being successful. Basically, the boss, then classmate, is a millionaire, so it was a practical decision.

At first, I was happy seeing him fulfilled after being unemployed for so long. However, things took a weird turn. They started becoming intensely close, to the point that even the boss’ gf accused him of being gay as well. First, other than messaging each other 24/7 outside of work, he had to go to his condominium (instead of their office) at 8 AM sharp so they could go to work together. Then he stays there for dinner to eat or accompany him in whatever task he has after work. So basically, he gets home at like 8 PM, but it doesn’t stop there, they enjoy playing games with each other until early in the morning. Before you say I’m being delusional, there were other times he has to accompany his boss outside of work, like watch his tennis games and go on personal travels all paid by the boss. It became an issue between the boss and his gf because he chose my bf to accompany him in an expensive resort in the PH than his own gf. There were also several occasions he had to sleep over in his condo, and sometimes in the same room. Basically, it was weird that he was spending almost 24/7 with a guy when they have a whole living girlfriend.

Don’t worry even I’m questioning my own sanity if I’m just being crazy for accusing him. But the point is it doesn’t stop there, his boss buys him clothes and pays for other expenses (travels, drinking, etc). He also promised to buy him cars and phones. There was this even one instance he asked me if it was okay to ask his boss if he can borrow 1 million, and I said no. And before I forget, his birthday was also paid by his boss (yeah he told me). And he also allows him to borrow his cars. Alone, those are all normal. But having all those benefits all together adding up? It was weird for me cos it felt like he was cheating.

Other than the financial gain, I think their relationship developed into something intimate. When his boss broke up with his gf, he had to be one call away. And when we would fight, he would call his boss regarding our problems. When we broke up for a month, he stayed in his boss condominium for a whole straight week bc he was his shoulder to cry on.

I’m all for LGBTQ+ rights, but it’s just not nice having someone emotionally cheat on me in that way.

It is a pretty spacious place where I had lived for most of my life until my mom and I moved in with my stepfather. This summer, I moved back to that apartment where now my aunt, her boyfriend and two of her sons lived, 23m and 15m. It’s my family home, I am registered in this apartment and considered a “part-owner” (not sure how to explain that correctly).

Now, my aunt broke up with her boyfriend and moved in with another man, so she no longer lives here. My cousin P (23m) has a girlfriend A (f18) living with him here. I have my own room, they live in the biggest room and my younger brother has his own room as well (he did not move out to live with his mother). 

So, to the issue: a month ago, I asked my aunt how much I was supposed to pay. She gave me the number and I was surprised because she split the bill in three, not four, like I had expected. I paid that amount though hoping to resolve that issue later. 

Yesterday, A texted me that I had to send her the money cause they were paying that monthly bill (they are paying from her bank account). It was the same amount as the month before and I got frustrated — clearly, my aunt still didn’t think that A had to pay for living here. My aunt was actually over, so I went up to her asking to elaborate which resulted in a huge fight. She said that since A was not “registered” in the apartment like the rest of us, she didn’t have to pay. She also called me an asshole for bringing up the subject and refusing to pay the amount she had requested. 

I ended up paying that once again, but then received a message from aunt which said that she had split the bill in four and from now on she’ll expect the money in her account every 15th of each month.

For months they asked me to come work for them, because I’ve got specialized experience that would benefit their company. 
I finally agreed. 
They sent me an offer letter and I accepted. 

I then gave notice to my apartment land lord, packed all my stuff in storage, and headed to Tennessee with the belief this company was going to honor their promise to also provide room and board. 

I get to Tennessee, and start their on-boarding process, with their Safety Director. He basically sits there for two days and reads a boiler plate safety /drugs/alcohol policy at me…while being interrupted by incoming calls from the main line. 
The Safety Director is doing double-duty as the Receptionist. 
He also stops in the middle of the on-boarding to take the lunch order for everyone in the office. And then drives over to the restaurant to pick it up…and then brings it back, going office to office, distributing the order. 

Meanwhile, every thing that made the offer attractive to me to come to Tennessee, started falling apart like the Fyre Festival. 
What they told me I would be doing, immediately after starting, was a lie. They’ve got these general labor side gigs, that have little to do with my specialized experience…they expected me to do until February of 2023, because they had no clients. 
They told me they had clients, but the clients abruptly canceled their contracts. So I wouldn’t be doing *that* , I would actually be doing *this* which is labor intensive…and less than half of what I was making at my previous employer. 

Then I had questions. 
I started asking why the Safety Director was doing double-duty as the receptionist. 
The Executive Director says “He likes to do those things. We all pick up the slack. I even clean toilets.”

And I ask “Why are you cleaning toilets? Aren’t you responsible for signing contracts with clients?”
I then went on and pointed out that they had a multi-million dollar contract with one client, and they couldn’t hire a receptionist at $18 per hour, to answer the phones and take the lunch order? 
And that maybe if he spent less time cleaning toilets and following up on leads they would have contracts with other clients, and they wouldn’t have me doing this labor intensive side-job for half of what I was making at my previous company.

My best friend (22F) got into a relationship with: let's call her Jane (22F) last year and they have been together for 1 year. I've been very involved with their lives and because she’s my best friend, i also got close to Jane, which i'am super grateful about. It took about a few months for Jane and i to be able to build our trust and friendship up to the point that we text everyday like gal pals. 
However, Jane hated that my best friend smoked cigarettes and have told her multiple times to quit. 

The thing is, one day Jane asked my best friend to quit smoking, like cold turkey, immediately and obviously when i heard about it i was shocked because there is no way someone who has been smoking for 6 years can just stop just like that. Her reasoning was because she wanted her to live a healthy and long life and honestly that was sweet of her.

Either way, I didn't say anything about it and let their relationship be because I had no say in it. After being asked to quit, my best friend still smokes behind her back and with me too, which i'am extremely guilty about but she told me that she can only quit if she wants to quit, and it's impossible for her to quit just like that, and i agreed. The thing is, I could see the progress that Jane couldn't which is she has been smoking less sticks everyday, which also made me stop smoking in the process of seeing that. It got to the point where she only smokes 4-5 sticks a week. 
Of course, she is still wrong for lying to her gf about it but whenever her gf asks me whether she’s still smoking, my bestfriend would ask me to lie for her and, yeah i did lie for her sake. 

Anyways, fast forward to how the gf found out. Me, my bestfriend, the gf and another one of our bestfriend, lets call him B. went on a trip together. (this bestfriend also knows that she still smokes) And they got into a heated shouting argument over something, which made B snitch on my bestfriend. Jane went hysterical and i was caught in the middle of it all. 

Ever since then, Jane stopped talking to me. And she got mad at me for lying to her, understandable i guess. 
My bestfriend’s rs with me got strained and we talk really less now, i dont share anything with her anymore. 

But after this whole incident, I still don’t think i did anything wrong. I only did what my bestfriend would have done for me and the gf cannot blame me for that.

The reason I don't go to school is cause I have extreme social anxiety, I can't go on walks without feeling terrified. And I used to be bullied alot at my old school for everything. How I talked, how I acted, my overbite, my name, being part of the LGBT community, my acne, you name it. And all the bullying has caused a pretty big affect on me and my mental health.

I am now at another school, my old one was a special needs one (I have Autism) and my mother didn't want me going there anymore, I'm still not sure why. Anyways I don't have any friends at this school and I'm very quiet and closed off unless in small groups with kidd and staff I get along with. Making friends is very hard for me and I can't even ask questions during class cause I feel like if I do everyone will immediately start thinking horrible thoughts about me.

My biggest coping mechanism is my bed, my phone, and my weighted blanket. I often times talk to my friends and play role-playing games with them cause fiction feels safer then reality. Drawing also helps me calm down and I do it very often. 

This may also be important but I have struggled with not wanting to live and hurtinh myself for as long as I can remember.

Sorry for all that but I felt it was important for you know, context reasons. Anyways. The argument started when she shouted to me from her room to go to the bus. I couldn't hear her so I texted her instead, begging her to let me stay home. She said no I've missed too much school. Which is true, I hardly ever go to school cause it causes me so much distress and fear, just thinking about it makes me wanna cry. 

I told my mom that I couldn't go, it was too scary and I accidentally stayed up all night. She said that if I didn't go I'd be taken away, she says this alot. I told her she's an adult and I'm just some kid who has like no friends and I'm too scared to even go outside by myself. I told her that I have no support except my online friends because I have no irl friends and it's not like I'd go to her cause this is exactly how she acts when I'm struggling. First she tries to help by not doing anything then she just threatens me. One time she said she should of left us (Me and my brother) with our father because if we were beat everyday maybe we'd have some respect. This is the very same father she said would put me in a mentalhospital if I was left with him. Needless to say I started hyper ventilating and sobbing audibly and all she could say was what's up with you and then blame my brother.

I'm very sorry for this being so long and stuff, I'm kinda upset right now so this is kinda a vent. I know I'm not necessarily in the right cause even if I have poor mental health I shouldn't put myself before my mother. It's just hard cause I have alot going on and alot of unresolved trauma so I guess existing just sucks. If you have any questions or whatever just like ask.

My in-laws own a dog sitting service and they ask a lot of us when it comes to helping them. I've been very hands off since they started because I quickly noticed issues and they didn't want to hear it, so I've stepped back. Countless times they've been unable to provide service and asked us to take over. I love animals of all sorts and love the company of dogs. I have my own and love them to death but we have a small apartment and having more dogs here is not ideal, especially when it's more than one. 

Regardless, we've had a long term boarder staying with us. She's a lot of extra work, as she pees on the floor no matter how many times you walk her. Yesterday she was injured when her leash got tangled with our other dogs (I'm not sure what happened I wasn't there). She's now in a lot of pain and howls every time she moves her leg. The vet prescribed meds and said it's a neck injury. I feel awful for this baby. She's a good girl and doesn't deserve to be in pain. 

Here's the issue, we're being asked to keep her here through the weekend. Normally I wouldn't mind, but my husband and I won't be home today for work and tomorrow I'd be home alone since my husband is going somewhere with his friends. I don't think it's smart to leave this dog home with my dogs who have no concept of personal space. God forbid they step on her or something. As for tomorrow, I'm not comfortable being home alone with the injured dog. As much as I love her, she's not mine and if anything happens I know I'll be blamed. I'm also recovering from a severe illness and I'm not even confident that I can walk my own dogs alone tomorrow, nevermind adding an extra (injured) one into the mix. 

I asked my husband to either cancel his plans or ask another employee to step in, and apparently neither are an option. Today my in-laws are stepping in and taking over her care because no one will be home. Apparently ITAH because my in-laws can't watch her tomorrow and since I'm family I should be helping.

There was a moment she asked me stuff like ''What are you and my boyfriend talking about in your chats?'' to which i immediately froze and my best friend bailed me out to tell her it's none of her business right away.   


Fast forward several months to one year, they broke up due things not working out, which caused my best friend to stop responding to my calls or texts for several weeks, but we reunited afterwards. Another few months later, his (now ex-girlfriend) messaged me about hanging out, but i strongly refused without responding. Best friend asked me if spoke with her, to which i responded that i didn't. When we got to hang out again, she wouldn't stop bothering me either via texts or in person with personal questions while i'm quite busy with art or personal stuff at home, which kept on boiling my blood.. and still does to this day. She thinks she's entitled to ask me a lot about the stuff i do with my best friend, but i kept turning the question down.  


Here comes the part where **i might be the the asshole:**   
I tend to pretend that i didn't hear her or ignore texts when she asks me something, due the things i've mentioned above. I've thought of avoiding her from the time being due to not feeling well, but alas, our ''friendship'' is still kind of bitter on my side of things.

i currently pay my way to help out my mother but my sibling, M to F, 32 and i have never had the best relationship due to them abusing me physically and mentally (ever since i was young). 

the point of view of this post is about a pet that i had when i was a child (cockatiel). this was an emotional support pet who i had from when i was 12 years old to 2016 (25). (i was badly bullied as a child and this bird really helped get me through the pain of the abuse at home and school).

this older sibling caused the death of this emotional support pet and hid it from me.

my parents have allowed this sort of behaviour from my older sibling, 32, to happen, to the point where my other older sibling, F 43 and I have lessened contact to our sibling in this subject (everyone has labelled this troublesome sibling as the golden child.

To the issue on this comment- i went to see my older sibling- 43 year old sister, to get my nails done as she was helping me to prepare for an event that a guy who I like will be going to this event. (must of been away from my house for at least 3 hours); my mother, 32 year old sibling and this siblings partner?? (were all not sure what's going on with this situation) had left the house and took the ashes of my deceased pet and went to the sibling in questions house.

i have told them both (mother and sibling) for years to never take the ashes away from my house due to in the past they both kept on arguing with me about wanting to break open the box and either split the ashes into two and them both disregarding my wishes. 

today my mother had rang me to tell me that they had the ashes and will not bring them back to me, the owner of the deceased pet, from my older siblings place.

i had advised my mother to bring the ashes back in my possession before i got back home from work (that was in the afternoon) or else i would involve the cops (as explained above they've both tried to tamper with the ashes for my siblings benefit before but have been told repeatedly not to do this).

We met months ago and have been dating for the last 3 months. However, there’s been some things that I’ve been very uncomfortable with her doing and have just been massively turned off by.

She has a group of friends that aren’t the best influence. the girls in the group go out almost every night and some of them have slept with many guys since I’ve known them, it seems to be a weekly occurrence. there’s one friend that is a serious alcoholic, she will go out almost every night and get blacked out. She doesn’t wake up till 10-11 am for work at times and during the weekend. The group contains a few guys that have made moves on my now gf while we’ve been seeing each other, and she shut them down which was great, but they still all hang out which I find is weird. By no means do I not trust my gf, I just don’t trust the guys to not make another move on her and don’t know why she would hang out with them out of respect for me.

Anyway, I have to travel a lot for my job so I am constantly out of town. It seems everytime I’m out of town my gf is convinced by the girls to go out with her. Which usually isn’t a big deal but it seems to become a more common occurrence and never really turns into anything bad.

Gf is puking in the bathroom at 3 am. I find this extremely repulsive and unattractive.

I told her I was disappointed in her that she’s hanging around terrible influences and she should be focusing on her career and job more, than going out regularly and especially puking on a Thursday night while staying up at 3 am and sleeping late for work.

My father lived for my mother, I have never seen someone so in love and so selfless. After 5 very difficult years, my mother passed, living me and my father alone. He was devastated, I am sure that he would have taken his life if he didn’t have me to raise. My mother’s will was for her ashes to be released in the sea, but my father strongly wanted to have her ashes in our house as he was in survival mode and felt that “having her around” somehow gave him the strength to go on. 
In the years to follow, my father didn’t even think about having a new relationship until I was about 15, he had two relationships, both very difficult, both ended quite badly. 
Now I moved out about 7 years ago and my father has been dating a woman for two years, I have never met her due to the fact that I wasn’t approving of their relationship: in fact she is a married woman with two children living in the same house as her, and since day one she started dating my father without telling her family because she couldn’t afford to live on her own. 
According to her, her marriage was long dead and her children don’t even care about her, but she went two full years without even thinking of getting a divorce. Now apparently she has asked for it, and my father and this woman want to buy a house in the countryside to live out their days. 
Now remember the ashes that my father strongly wanted to have by his side? Turns out that now his girlfriend doesn’t want them in their new house, she says that it would be exactly as if she brought the man she divorced in their house. So NOW my father either wants to respect my mom’s will and throw them in the sea or bring them to their house but “hide them” and he made sure to let me know that this latter hypothesis would have been the cause of arguments and tensions with his new girlfriend. 
Of course in this scenery I want to respect my mum’s will and avoid letting her ashes sit in a hostile environment, but I feel that this woman is unable to accept my dad’s past, I feel like my dad instantly stopped caring about my mum as if she was just “another one of his exes and maybe since this woman can’t seem to accept his past it’s just a matter of time until I become a problem as well.

Later, I tell her who I like. I told her I think my crush liked her because I was friends w him. A few days later, I saw her wearing a hoodie I recognised at a school event and found out it was my crushes. Asked around a little and since I'm friends with both ends of the relationship  I found out they were dating. Honestly, I didn't care that much about the guy– I was mad at the girl.

Like a week later, they broke up and I was a therapist on both ends (mostly my crush). AITA for trying to help the guy see that the girl is toxic because she wasn't clear about the breakup, is a total player, has a crush in every grade and said her parents found out and wouldn't allow her when she went to a concert in NY alone.

For the purpose of this story we'll call them Danny(21M) &amp; Sammy(21M).

Today is the release of Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. I preordered both cause I've wanted these games all year and the region is inspired by Spain but has a mix of Hispanic &amp; Latino American cultures involved. I saw a really cool Samba dancing bird pokemon and oh my god! It was gorgeous. Masculine yet feminine, sparkly yet lively. It slayed and was fabulous, as they say and it looked perfect for me.

I decided to show a few friends, Sammy and Danny included. Danny started getting mad after I said how the Pokemon looked like a Samba Dancer for a carnivál parade. You know the dancers dressed as Peacocks. All he heard was Carnivál and not the rest. Sure I may not know much about Carnivál the celebration, but I do know they have a parade and it looks fun, I like the vibe and aesthetic.

Then Danny just goes on about 'Do I know what Carnivál is for?' 'Why does he sparkle?' and how it's a religious thing for lent. I respect all religions and practices but I didn't ask for that information but I listened and started feeling bad for liking this dancing bird. I tried saying it's just a game and not real which made both of them mad and they said it's their job to 'Educate' me.

I get that they're both Hispanic and Latino but this was the third time. Me and Sammy had a 2-3 hour arguement where I tried to say it's all fantasy and that it's a game. Nothing real about Pokemon right? But they kept saying that they are oppressed and they have to do this to change society and educating people is their right. This gave me red flags, so I left for a bit. My friends sounded like those cancel culture people you see in Twitter vids.

I called my boyfriend(24M) and I was so upset. I showed him the Pokemon in question and he is Mexican and Puerto Rican by the way. He loved the Samba Bird as much as I did and said it looks like a good partner for me. But, I just painfully said I didn't want the games anymore. Said I'd sell them because I didn't want to hurt people.

I haven't slept, it's 6AM and I just feel sad and like a monster, instead of being happy and excited. I was gonna record or stream my gameplay but now I feel like I'll get cancelled and that I'll be a bad person for playing the game.

I don't want to lose my friends, I just want to experience Gen 9 and enjoy it with my boyfriend.

Before we had the child we agreed that she would be primarily in charge of childcare, while I would do practically everything else. This includes 95% of chores and other housework, I am the only one between the two of us that works a job(Night Shift Security Guard), I make dinner for the family, etc.   


I want to clarify some things before I get INFO'd in the comments. When I say I do 95% of the chores, I mean that my wife will do some of the dishes like the babies bottles or cups when they need to be washed and I am asleep during the day, and occasionally fold a load of laundry that she needed a piece of clothing from before I can get around to it. I vacuum and mop the floors, do the laundry, the dishes, clean the bathrooms, cook dinner and do the grocery shopping. She takes our child to doctors appointments, wakes up with them during the night(on the days I am at work), watches them during the day, and will make baby specific meals(She will puree vegetables and fruit, and cut up smaller portions of chicken).   


I do spend as much time as I can with our child. I wake them up in the mornings when I come home from work and feed them breakfast before I sleep. When I wake up I'll try to play with them for about 30 minutes, doing reading and playing with whatever toy they're interested in for the week. During the weekends when I am awake during the night I will be the one who gets up with our child.  


This is coming to a head because as we were eating dinner before I went to work, she asked if there was any way that I could watch our child more due to her feeling like she needs time for herself. At first I thought that she wanted to have more weekend events with her friends while I watch our child during the day, something I am more than okay with and have agreed with multiple times. Instead she was asking that I sleep less during the days that I work so that she can have breaks from the child during the day. I told her that I would think about it at work and I want to say no. I understand that being a SAHM is stressful because you always have to watch the baby, but she doesn't do any chores and from the way things were phrased she wouldn't be willing to take up any chores during the new break I would be giving her. I don't have much time to myself either, but I do understand that she carries the stresses of watching our child most of the time while I don't.

I (17F) and my siblings (17F and 12M) are living with our mum but stay at our dads for about 4 days out out 14, My parents have been separated for about 2 years but only officially divorced recently. My dad is very manipulative and guilt trips us a lot, I have seen messages of him telling people about how entitled we are and how awful we are, he quotes us on things we have never said and keeps saying the my twin and I are evil and b*tches. He says we have too much pride (im an introvert and I’m very self conscious so I don’t agree) and our mum is ‘controlling us’ he says stuff like ‘f*ck ‘em all’ and keeps telling people things that have never happened, he said that we yell at him and say these awful things that I don’t even feel comfortable repeating. I don’t know where he has come up with this. This leads people to say they hate us and they will hit us for him. When I saw that message I was a bit freaked out. 

The most common thing is that he says we never want to do anything with him. Last weekend I went into town with him all Friday, went to a movie with him Sunday and out for dinner and then he said this when my twin, brother and I said we didn’t want to go for a 7am walk or that we didn’t want to go buy shirts for him. I know I could have just gone but like I said, I’m an introvert so even just doing one thing is exhausting and emotionally draining for me.

Me and my friend are friends for about 3 years mostly over the internet. We both have issues with mental health but my friend is more able to function normaly (going to the pub etc). I have been going to therapy consistently for 2 years. It has helped a lot. But for more than a year now it seems like my friends state has worsened, or at least from what I have heard from them (I don't know any of their friends). 

When they vent to me I try to be supportive and find solutions if they want that. But I am not a therapist. I'm not a psychologist and I have no idea what I am doing. I am absolutely terrified that I will say the wrong thing and cause them to get worse. I have told them my fears and they have said that it is fine. But its really not. I have said the wrong thing sometimes and it has resulted in them taking it in the worst way. 

So I try to convince them to go to therapy. Sometimes they seem open to the idea and sometimed they really don't. Once they asked me if I could help them find a therapist and I went and talked to my therapist, my previous therapist and my psychiatrist for contact informations for people they would recommend. I looked at the ones that would be covered by his ensurance or at least partly covered. Nothing came of it. And throughout the year I would usually only have a contact with them if it pertained to mental health or them hurting themselves. 

I am not well. I am not healthy. I only leave the house for more than an hour once every two weeks to go to therapy. I hang out with friends in real life about once a month. I can and am trying to support my friend the best I can but I am exhausted. They regularly don't respond to me for weeks and mostly only talk to me if there is something going on with them pertaining to their mental state. It doesn't feel like friendship anymore, it feels like a patient-therapist relationship. And I am absolutely not equipped for than and most importantly I don't want that. I don't want feel terrified every time they talk to me. I don't want only hear about their mental state and how they want to hurt themselves, while rejecting anything that could help them. I am exhausted from almost every conversation we have. When I talked to them about it, they told me that we wouldn't have anything to talk about if they stopped. I told them that if our friendship revolves around that and not mutual interests, then our friendship is not very ""friendshipy"". They responded that I should block them for a month because they wont be able to talk about anything different.

He passed away 2 months ago due to a heart attack and his pre-existing condition of kidney failure as well. So only then we were informed that he had enrolled himself in a separate insurance program. I filed the insurance claim (as I was the beneficiary), a week after the burial and everything and they said that the minimum wait was 1 month. 

My sister (28F, also working, earning beyond minimum wage) followed up on the claim recently as I said that I wanted to wait for a few more weeks to call and follow up. So she did instead. When she followed up, the company said that it was ready to be claimed but she herself could not claim it because only I had the right to do so. 

She already had it figured out on what was she going to do. She wanted to buy a car for the family - because commuting prices are so high (as if petrol isn't???) she said it would be a practical purchase. I, on the other hand, have hesitations on this plan. Why? Because she also managed our family budget and we always end up short by the end of the month (sometimes not even!) We would lose electricity and even water! Even though the budget is enough or sometimes it was more than enough (I would know because after a few months of that, I requested that I manage the family budget instead). Sometimes, my tuition (I'm on a scholarship, so my tuition would cost around $200 - converted to US currency) would have to be paid in half even though the budget was sufficient enough to pay it in full. I also do not have any allowance, she does not give me any, because we are still conducting online classes. 

My dad was also aware of this, and he would ask me about it as to why only the 2nd week of the month, there was no more budget. Sometimes, he would pay out of his own pocket our food and bills (he's not complaining that he had to, but he does have to pay for his medicine and other stuff he needs) - even though we have the budget for it.

Background: My parents are separated. My mom sends our budget for us family (my brother and I are still studying, house maintenance and other stuff); my dad lives in the same house as us and pays for his own stuff and even shares in paying bills and even food because he owns a small business.

Given all of these, I feel like she was hurt that I was the only one written as a beneficiary (you can actually put 3 people; as long as they aren't a minor). But I really do not want to give her the money, for me, I want to save it first, and then save the extra money from our budget until we can actually afford to buy a car and its consistent maintenance.

When B asked again,  they  said they didn't think I'd do exactly what they said so they  didn't  explain more.

I denied and  offered  to build on my own but was not permitted to do so or would be  lent the  tools (even though I was carrying my own set). I told them I  was new to  HK and if I could converse in English as it seemed the  argument was  getting confusing but was told that since its HK I should  speak and be  able to read that their warranty was actually 1 week)  which was written  in Chinese.

We used to all be pretty close back when we all lived in the same city some 15 years ago, but now we're all in different towns; Alan is about 40 mins away from me, Rachel is about 2 hours away from Alan and I. 

Alan has been having a really rough time recently. He's been through a bad break-up, and has stayed where he is so he can be near his kids, but he doesn't really know anyone there and has been calling me in tears multiple times a week talking about how hard he has to work to afford rent on two places, and how isolated and utterly lonely he is. A couple of months ago I'd call him every evening just to check on him and let him talk; eventually he managed to make some significant changes to his lifestyle which have improved things a lot - getting therapy, and changing his working hours to be more consistent so he has his evenings and weekends back. 

Through this I've been telling Alan that I'm not that far away and I can come visit anytime. He finally got to a place where he rang and invited me over, and we picked the next weekday evening we were both available. I saw this as a huge step forward for him, and wanted to prove that he wasn't as isolated as he'd convinced himself he was. 

That morning, I get a calendar reminder that it's Rachel's birthday. I message her to say happy birthday and tell her I'll call her later. I had it in my head that I could surprise her with Alan on the call and she'd be happy to see us both. My, how wrong I was. 

I drove round to Alan's and we ordered a pizza, then video-called Rachel, and when she saw us together she was really upset, calling my being there a betrayal. I think she thought we had intentially arranged to hang out on her birthday and not invited her, which isn't true. She was obviously pissed on the call, and ended it pretty quickly. She's since been ignoring Alan completely, though she did message me to say she wanted the invitation even if she would have turned it down and that she's incredibly hurt we would treat her this way. 

I explained I didn't know it was her birthday until that morning, but the way she worded it made it sound like she would have been upset with us hanging out on ANY day without her. That she wanted to feel worth inviting, even if she just says no. 

If she had organised a party or a meetup for her birthday, on a weekend, I would have absolutely made the effort to go, but she didn't. I feel horrible that she's upset but I'm also quite cross that I'm now feeling guilty about something which was supposed to be a nice evening.

Last year the new boss offered every department a certain amount of money per head to host a small gathering with food for Christmas, which I found nice.

Someone organized a caterer and we sat together. I am a long time vegetarian and my colleagues know that (and make fun of it occasionally, which doesn't bother me too much, as it is usually in a friendly way). The only vegetarian thing last year were Potatoes and the dessert. I ate a bit, but did not complain, as it was short notice. 

This year the idea came up again and I directly asked, if it was possible this year, to get some vegetarian food for me, too. At first the person who organized it said ""sure, I'll get something"" but yesterday I received a call that they ordered and there was no veggie Option.

I know that the caterer's restaurant offers veggie options, they just did not order, because pasta is not a traditional Christmas Dinner. I asked the colleague who organized it to reconsider and call the caterer for one vegetarian portion (we are under 10 people in total). They complained what inconvenience this was to call again and my comment, that they knew that initially and could have asked directly was out of the line for them.

We weren't yelling, just talked about it, but I said If I only get to eat dry potatoes again I simply won't attend, as I find it rude to ignore it and rather cook  nice meal for me later t home without feeling ignored. I am NOT a picky eater - just no meat.

I thought I was doing the right thing to make sure I’m supporting them but AITA?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4803041,public,top,self,AITA for asking too many questions?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyh0c7/aita_for_asking_too_many_questions/,all_ads,6,,,,
