The reasons why this just doesn’t sit right with me is because: it leading to “addiction, isolation, increased aggression, distorted beliefs and perceptions about relationships and sexuality, negative feelings about themselves, and neglecting other areas of their lives”.

A main one for me is how voyeuristic one becomes when consuming corn daily and how one cannot see a naked body non-salaciously.

I have discussed this with him and we debated and talked and again. He told me “it’s what people do &amp; you aren’t always with me”, but I expected him to understand my reasoning.

This has detrimental effects that I don’t want to see affect him. He told me that I’m being “traditional with my thinking ways &amp; that this isn’t a linear as it seems”.

I’ve tried to address that there aren’t many pros especially whilst in a relationship. I can’t get behind it. That topic has been a bit cold lately and I know he is still consuming it. It just irks my soul, especially as someone who was exposed to p*rn since the age of 11.

My mom has some issues and my wife has zero patience. I'm not even talking about typical controlling MIL stuff, but more like personal issues. My mom is extremely weird about certain things such as eating, touching people/things, having control over what she wears/ her body. 

She isnt great with social norms and to be honest people do coddle her. My grandparents are just burnt out from raising her and don't even care at this point, and her husband is just happy as long as she is eating enough and doesn't care how bizarrely she behaves.

I don't believe in coddling her, but also feel my wife is controlling sometimes. I believe in giving my mom two choices with one being she can leave or opt out. For example if she wouldn't wear the color my wife picked for our wedding, she could just not be in pictures. If she is being rude and refusing to eat, she can leave the room. However i don't see the point in fighting with her. You are never going to win. 

We recently had a Christening for our son and my mom showed up in a strapless dress which is not allowed in my wife's family's church. My mom has never been to a church in her life and didn't think that was still a rule. To be clear this wasn't some clubbing dress and would have been fine if her shoulders were covered at all. 

My wife told her she can't go in like that and offered her MIL's sweater. My mom refused as it didn't match her dress and she didn't like it. she looked around for something else to wear and then offered to go home and join us for the party later. i thought that was fine but my wife got mad and said she was being selfish and acting like an idiot and demanded she put it on. My mom said no and started whining. My wife accused her of not loving her son/grandson and it became a power struggle. People (not my mom) started yelling at my wife. it was awful. 

I told my wife to leave her alone and said my mom could put it on or leave, but leaving is a perfectly valid option. My wife just gave me a death stare. My mom said she would leave and thanked me for being reasonable which I see was a dig on her part. Eventually my dad gave her a suit jacket and I thought everything was fine, but my wife was furious after the fact and said I sided with my mom and let her ruin our son's christening.

I gained it around 3 years ago when I was 16 and I’ve since lost all of my body hair. It affected my self confidence and sense of pride very badly to the point where I wore wigs and false eyebrows everyday, and I also still frequently posted on Instagram (I know), so I posted them there. Because of my shame, I begged my parents not to tell anybody about my alopecia and they didn’t, so nobody in my family knew apart from them. I decided to stop wearing wigs or false eyebrows 5 months ago, and even though it’s still really hard it feels kind of relieving. 

Well me and my parents went to my cousin’s wedding at the weekend (we haven’t seen anybody since before covid because we live across the country) and since I’m not really close to that side of the family, we were just given a dress code and they didn’t care about the rest, so I didn’t tell them about it. 

But when the wedding came, I felt really embarrassed. I really wasn’t trying to take anything away from my cousin but I will admit I had a lot of family members come up to me and ask what happened or talk about how different I look, and I think it made my cousin upset.

For context, I am a GenderFluid Bisexual individual who has been severely bullied by many different people after my coming out, and the classmate who I’ll call Lincoln, is a cis-gendered male who has spent the last few months of his school life making my life hell, making snarky comments about me and to me, such as ‘Oi wait what are your pronouns? She/Shay?’ (A term he uses to make fun of pronouns he refuses to believe I use), ‘How many genders are there, just asking don’t go getting loud about it?’, Constantly harassing me and other students all for a ‘good laugh’. That’s not even the half of it but I won’t go into detail.

Today, I got taken out of lessons with another girl to ask about an incident in a class the day before. It was to do with Lincoln being ‘supposedly racist’ and the teacher who took us out of class told us that he trusted us to tell him the truth and asked us what actually happened. From my point of view, I saw a booklet that belonged to a friend of mine, who has an African origin, was placed in front of Lincoln and he stood up and shouted ‘DO I LOOK LIKE ——? I’M NOT BLACK I’M WHITE’ and continued saying stuff like that until my teacher confronted him and said ‘Lincoln what’s the matter why are you shouting?’ And after everything got explained my teacher said ‘Well we don’t make comments about race or how people look’ etc.

I had to write down what happened and when it happened, a statement of sorts, and when I got home, I got a call from a former friend, who is ‘mates’ with Lincoln, saying that I snitched on him and got him expelled. He also warned me to stay away from Lincoln’s friend group after the weekend, so on Monday as they all ‘want to take a form of revenge’. I am currently getting talked about on a school group chat that I’m not in, and everyone is calling me a snitch etc etc. It’s not even my fault- I got asked what happened, so I said it as it was, even though the teacher knew exactly what happened he just wanted it from a students point of view. So AITA?

Because I live away from both and still study at university I usually don't make it to any of them on birthdays, except it's a weekend and I have the money. holidays are split between them both, I am usually at my mothers for Christmas and my father for Easter or during summer break.

My father was diagnosed with liver failure and lung cancer 3 months ago and I didn't take it well, since we just reconnected 5 years ago. I didn't even thought about going to him for  his birthday, but told my roommate that it was coming up. She looked at me funny and said: "" are you going to him? I mean he is sick? Doesn't that make it his last birthday?"" I started crying hysterically and then started pulling all my money together, she lend me about 100 bucks and I managed to get a late shift on Monday and excuse me from my classes.

 So I drove at Friday evening to my father and arrived at 6 am on Saturday. He was so happy to see me and we spend his birthday weekend together. I then took the bus Sunday evening and arrived Monday morning in time for my shift. I was so happy to have celebrated with him.

I ask what she meant and she said she saw the picture of me and my father on his birthday. 

I explained that I didn't have the money and she started yelling how ungrateful I was, that he left etc. They had a year long divorce and after I said I wouldn't go with him, he left. I again said I didn't have the money and had to eat cup noodles the last month to pay my roommate back but she didn't listen. I told her that it probably was his last birthday and since I finish my degree in May and have a good paying job lined up next year shouldn't be a Problem. She again yelled and I hung up.

I (33F) and my partner John (33M) have been going through a rough patch of late, and I want to know if I’m way off and need to re-think things.

We’ve been married 6 years, together before that, and have 2 kids (4, 2). I should also note, we have no family around for childminding etc etc. When we first met, he was working as an electrician with normal hours etc. Then very early on he got a job working FIFO (Fly in, fly out). For anyone not familiar, it means he works at a mine and flies there for his roster. This was to pay off some debts and save up for a house etc etc. That roster was 4 weeks on, and 1 week home. Brutal roster, but I understood, because I’ve also worked FIFO in mining as well. Right now he is working 1 week on, 1 week home - alternating shifts. So day shift, And then night shift. So there’s some difference in timing because of that. 

Now, here is where I am being told I’m the asshole and in the wrong. When first Bub was born, we agreed it would be better for him to keep working there while bub was so small. So I took maternity leave, and then tried going back to my job, but the hours were too gruelling to ‘single parent’ while he was away. So I had to quit. And then second Bub happened. And so I had to remain not working to make that work, because he wanted to keep working away for the money. So I got a job again, and found one that is incredibly supportive of the fact I have to ‘single parent’ sometimes and miss days. As of about 6 weeks ago, I now work 4 days a week and have the kids the other days. I used to work 3 days a week before that.

So the issue is, I’ve reached my limit. My mental and physical health have completely deteriorated, I’m incredibly stressed and tired all the time, very very overwhelmed. I’ve been the rock or the glue or whatever metaphor you’d like to use, but that’s me for our family. And right now I’m not being it well. And I’ve begged for help. But he feels as though he’s doing the hard yards working away, and we need to sacrifice for a few more years at least. But more importantly he has told me on more than one occasion that this is his dream job, and he’ll never get anything better, and he’s finally happy in his career. So, I’ve tried to explain that while I understand it’s your dream job, I have strongly felt I can’t cope anymore. 

He has ultimately said that I’m being selfish and can’t dictate his life. I said that even if he takes a pay cut (working in town) I would rather be a family and not have lots, than to not be a family at all.

And he said, quote:
Being a family doesn’t pay the fucking bills

(I actually set it up to not alert the police without me confirming, it's not actually automatic) 

And I also got sooo sick of salesmen coming by when I hung up signs saying no soliciting which they're not supposed to bother you after. And I've been getting a LOT because I just bought the house and I guess a lot of businesses look at sale records and go to bother new homeowners. 

I opened my door to a couple pushy sales pitches thinking it was uber eats or something. Honestly kinda freaked me out because some dudes get really pushy, like even physically blocking the door open when I was stupid enough to open it, and I'm a pretty small lady living alone.

So I just started having a laugh by setting off my house alarm on purpose if someone in some kinda businesses uniform shows up to sell shit anyway. 

I'll just hit the ""test"" setting on my alarm panel then holler ""DYLAN!!! OH MY GOD DYLAN, WAKE UP! HELP! SOMEONE'S TRYING TO BREAK IN!"" 

I'm just a woman living alone, there is no ""Dylan"", but every time, theyre gone fast when I start yelling for him. I'm not bothering the neighbors, they live far enough away that they don't hear the alarm. And it's kinda funny honestly to fuck with people who know they're not supposed to try and sell shit if you've got a sign. 

I told some of my friends that and they thought it was kinda a shitty joke, making people who are just doing a job freaked out that they set off a burglar alarm that generally alerts the police (mine doesn't, but who'd know)

But I also never saw a company come by twice anymore.

Hopefully, I'll be graduating in 24'. My parents are divorced and I live with my mom and younger brother (who is also attending college). My mom is the only one who supports us financially.

I had worked for a while so I could lessen the burden on her, but she told me to quit and pay more attention to my classes.

A few years ago, my mom caught my dad cheating on her with one of his co-workers. She had also caught him a few times before and decided that it was enough. From then on he didn't attend my high school graduation. The only times he would call me were to talk about himself or ask where my brother was.

I overheard my dad talking badly to my mom, telling her that we were her problem and that she should deal with us. She was asking for his help because he had put her information on the hospital bill from my brother's surgery since she couldn't take him, and he was supposed to help pay half of my brother's schooling but he didn't.

That was the last straw for me and I decided that I wasn't going to talk to him anymore.

It wasn't until this year that he was getting married. He would message me about how I was doing or tell me that he was coming down to visit (he lives 4 hours away now). I told him that I was taking 5 courses and that I was too busy to go to his wedding. I ended up missing his wedding and he messages me about what I liked in the past and hears about how I'm doing from my grandparents.

This is why I decided not to attend the Thanksgiving gathering from my dad's side of the family. My grandparents are always taking my dad's side, despite knowing what he did to my mom and wanting me to talk to my dad. I keep having to tell them that I don't have time to worry about someone that didn't give me the time of day and they think that my mom is making me not talk to my dad. I've honestly had enough of it and that's why I don't talk to my grandparents.

This Thanksgiving will be the first time my brother won't be going because my brother is going to be working (he lives 2 hours away from us). I'm stuck between wanting to go, just because I'm the oldest grandchild and I want to help my grandparents set up everything. It has been a tradition, every year I show up at 6 am to help out. However, I don't like the thought of having to talk to my dad.

He recently came down and showed up outside my house while I was taking a nap because this week I didn't really sleep. Anyway, in a span of 3 minutes, he showed up outside my house and called me, messaged me, then told me he was going to see me on Thanksgiving. Mind you, my mom was home as well, but was working out and didn't know he even stopped by. I asked her if my dad called her, but she told me he didn't. She showed me her call log and told me that the only person who called her was my aunt. He know's my mom was home because all our cars were in the driveway.

Back in highschool, my 'friends' were mocking me for not having a girlfriend. Being the homosexual in denial that I was, I quickly became obsessed with the idea of getting one to be 'normal'. So when this girl in my class (who was quite pretty and honestly seemed nice) asked me out, I said yes.

Going out with her felt wrong on many levels. I wasn't in the best place mentally and this girl who acted so nicely at school turned out to be very controlling and abusive. I couldn't talk about my feelings with anyone, and I ended up believing I deserved to be mistreated because I was taught my whole life that what I felt towards boys was wrong.

Even now, I still sometimes feel like what she said and did to me was the right thing to do, and I can't help but miss her in those moments. Don't get me wrong, I love my boyfriend and I've never been happier than those past few months, but there's that tiny part of me that wishes my ex never left.

My dad is about 25 years older than my mom so all 3 of my siblings from him are 17+ years older than me. I didn’t have a relationship with that side of the family for majority of my childhood, but my dad and grandparents often sent money, holiday cards, birthday gifts, etc. I’m a lot closer to them now and had good relationships with all of my siblings, nieces and nephews until this happened. 

I own a 1976 Corvette Stingray that was gifted to me by my maternal grandpa when I turned 17. I’ve built this car up from a roller and it’s my most prized possession. I went out of town for 2 weeks for work and left my car in my paternal grandparents’ garage. I don’t like keeping it at my place when I’m away for long because I don’t live in the best area. I’ve done this since my freshman year of college and there has never been any issue until now. 

When I got back in town, I immediately went to my grandparents house to pick up my car and there was a big dent and a lot of paint missing off the side of my car.  It looked like someone side swiped my car. I asked them what happened and they were confused. When I showed them they were as shocked as I was. They told me that my nephew “Kevin” 25M had been messing around in the garage the previous weekend but they didn’t see him take the car at all. We checked their camera system and sure enough, he had taken my car. 

I tried to call Kevin but my number was blocked so I called my brother and told him what Kevin did to my car. He said he’ll ask him about it and recommended a body shop for the estimate and repair. When I got the estimate back, there was $3700 in damages. I told my brother the estimate and he said that the estimate was ridiculous and that the damages weren’t “that bad.” I told him either he or Kevin had to pay for it to get fixed or I’d be contacting the police. I gave him 3 days and he didn’t pay me so I filed a police report and gave them the videos of him taking my car. Kevin was arrested at work and my brother was pissed. 

He called me going off about how I ruined Kevin’s life over a car and said some threats. My sisters and dad have been calling and texting me asking me to just put the family first and drop the charges but I don’t want to.

Let’s call him Gary. Gary’s gay and has a large group of party loving gay male friends so obviously we went out to some clubs/bars. 

At some point, it came up that my fiancé is bi (I’m bi too). That’s when Gary’s friends became very touchy-feely with him. It didn’t bother us at first, we just saw them as being friendly plus we were many drinks (and other things) in. But then it escalated to one of Gary’s friends nearly groping my fiancé and openly hitting on him right in front of me! I tried to play it off like ‘hey, this one’s mine haha’. And someone scoffed and said something to the effect of ‘oh you’re still doing the whole monogamy thing, how cute’ and called us ‘practically straight’ and heteronormative. I got pretty offended. Nothing wrong with being straight but bi-erasure in 2022? Bi people know what I’m talking about, that shit is so annoying. 

Now, I know Gary is monogamous (even though his bf couldn’t make it that night) so I looked at him. He made a face and later, when we had a moment alone, sort of even apologized to us. I say sort of because he said ‘sorry they’re a bit much. But you know, it’s LA, monogamy [in the LGBT community] isn’t really a thing here.’ 

My fiancé and I are from NYC and still live there so it’s not like we’re unfamiliar with LGBT culture. And monogamy is common here amongst our gay friends. Hell, I’ve been to enough gay weddings to know a lot of us DO believe in monogamy. I told him his friends were rude to assume we had an open relationship and they’re just using “LA culture” as an excuse. He got defensive and called me prudish. So yeah, the night ended on a sour note.

A bit of context; I've been ill for the past few weeks. What started off as a simple cold has developed into a chest infection. (It's not C*ovid, I have done all the tests which came back negative). My coughing fits have been so bad that I've thrown up because of them and had to take time off work. (Today I coughed up a small bit of blood; I'm not too worried as I think it's more that my throat is red-raw rather than an issue with my lungs but still, I'll be visiting a doctor if it gets worse - so far it's just been one instance).

Anyway, I was in the kitchen with my BF having a normal conversation when I started to cough again (it's quite a loud, horrible cough! Imagine a smokers cough combined with a whooping cough, that's the best way I can describe how it sounds). Anyway, my coughing cut him off mid-sentence and to that he rolled his eyes at me, clearly annoyed.

This really upset me. I'm already self conscious about how loud my coughing can get since I feel like it draws too much attention (I'm self conscious as it is which my BF knows). 

So I called him out on his reaction because I was upset that he was being really dismissive. 

He thinks I'm being over sensitive and 'taking everything as an attack' when he says it was just a reflexive reaction. He thinks I'm punishing him for an involuntary reaction, but he went on to admit that he's annoyed by my coughing (as if I have any control over it)! 

Honestly I just think it's really inconsiderate and a cruel reaction to have all together. I feel like if the shoe were on the other foot and I rolled my eyes at him for anything, he'd be just as annoyed and feel as though I didn't care or that I had disrespected him. So I said as much but he still thinks he didn't do anything wrong. 

We argued for a bit so I've gone to the bedroom to get away from him for a bit.

 I feel like it's worth mentioning that he has quite a severe case of eczema; I buy 99.99% of his creams and lotions and every night I treat his skin. I have done this for pretty much the entire time we've been dating (over  2 years) and not once have I thought 'Oh, this is so annoying!' or made him feel like he's being an inconvenience. I have always been sympathetic because I know it causes him a lot of discomfort and I want to help in anyway I can!

Background: I recently got a new job with a big raise. I now have extra income for the first time in 3 years. My family isn't big on gifts, so I wanted to give back to a family in need so they could have a good Christmas. 

I found a family on a reputable site that was in need of help. I choose this family because it was one child and the mother. The rules states you only have to buy for those under 14, and the child is 10. They have a lot in common with me interests wise so I was very excited. I reached out to the mom and she sent me an Amazon.com wishlist (for suggestions, not to exclusively shop at) and the ideas were reasonable. Art kits, books, socks, school supplies, makeup, and accessories. She told me her childs specific requests for gifts, and they were all reasonable. Her child is aware their mom is getting extra help this year, and is very grateful. I even asked about supplying Christmas dinner for them, which is not required. 
The mother recently reached out again with an updated list. Again, I was excited to see until I pull it up and see things added that were WAY out of range from what we discussed. Instead of small things she added big ticket items like a gaming console, bean bag chair(adult size), high end notepads over $20, name brand makeup kits, fancy pens, and Disney branded clothes and socks. Still things the child wants, but much more expensive. 
My plan for the child this entire time was to give them new books from my personal collection (actually new, not read or used condition), some art kits, some beginners makeup sets, and socks, scarf, shirts, and food for a Christmas dinner. I would love to give this child an amazing holiday, but what the mom is now expecting is just not in my budget.

He then laughed and told her i was trying to ""feel like a man"" by making it seem like I had money.

I was pissed so I venmoed him the money to just show him I'm not a joke and I can handle my responsibilities and pay for things my kids damage. When my wife found out she blew up.

The first time I was told no was because my grandpa had just gotten home from the hospital and needed to wind down. He needed to relax, which is understandable so I was fine with it. The second time was an immediate no from myself because I was sick, and with my grandpa being high-risk I did not want to be the reason he went back to the hospital. This weekend was weird though.

My father (40) started dating my stepmom (35ish?) about eight years ago. She has two children, both from her ex husband, one f10 and the other m13. I've never had to take into account when they would be at our house for the weekend, because it never mattered when I wanted to see friends or go to my grandparents house. But today my father replied back to me saying he liked when all of us kids were home together so I couldn't go. (Me, my older brother and my two step-siblings) This agrivated me to the point I began to cry because I have been trying for what seems like so long but it was one thing after another and this had never happened before. 

I'm always in my bedroom, regardless of whether my stepsiblings are home or not and I have stayed at my grandparents house without having to wait for my stepsiblings to be at their dads house. My stepsiblings are also always in their room, and my older brother is in his room more than anyone. 

My stepmom has had issues with my older sister(f19) since she was 16 years old and part of me believes I can't go to my grandparents because she recently moved back down here and lives with my grandparents right now. The long-story-short is my sister and stepmom do not get along at all. 

But at the same time, maybe my dad just feels safer with all the kids at home right now? Maybe he knows something I don't that could play some part in this whole ordeal?

Although the building has rules regarding not making noise after 11 PM and before 7 AM, these neighbors have disregarded these rules over and over, and I have contacted the building administration a couple times before, but they just lower the noise when the administration tells them to, and make noise again the next day.
I usually get up at 5:30 - 6 AM during week days due to work, and as such, I usually go to bed at around 10 - 10:30 PM.
So yesterday at night (Thursday to Friday), the neighbors started drilling the walls and (by the sound of it) assembling furniture in the room right above my bedroom at 11 PM, finishing past midnight. Although the building administration was called, they did not stop. 
So, as this has been an ongoing situation, I got petty, and today at 5:30 AM I started my morning by banging on the ceiling, gluing a small speaker to the ceiling of the bedroom and playing music on it, and generally mailing noise directed to the ceiling (to try and annoy my neighbors from below the less possible).

It was supposed to be short term. It's difficult having her here, and her son can be very sweet, but he has Oppositional Defiance Disorder and can be a nightmare to deal with.

It's been 5 months and Guest is no closer to figuring her situation out. Then A got in a huge fight with Guest over her sons behavior and the lack of discipline. Like, an 18 year friendship shattering fight. They refuse to talk to each other, and Guest has declared A abusive and toxic for her child (I have a plethora of examples why this isn't the case).

So, I gave Guest a 30 day notice. It was a house decision (there are several of us) because in all honesty, everyone else wanted her gone months ago, but A always defended her. 

Now she's acting like the rest of us are horrid. While I feel for Guest and her kid, and offered to do what I can to help, she still went to social media to blast us about not helping her, kicking her out, being the reason she's going into a shelter, etc. For the record, I'm selling an old car and offered her $4000 from the sale to pay for her own apartment (that amount would cover her for about 5 months in our city) and she turned me down. I really do feel bad for her, and I feel that both her and A were right and wrong in the fight, but when it comes down to it, A is my friend and the only reason Guest came to stay with us is because of A. I honestly don't know what Guest expected. That we would all kick A out over this? She's on the lease, and they were both wrong and right on some things, but the decision they could bo longer live together was mutual and A IS ON THE LEASE while Guest is not. It shouldn't be a huge shock. A WAS overly harsh about Guest's son, and we all did talk to her about it, but the 10yo's behavior is a real issue and Guest completely shuts down any attempt to discuss it whatsoever. On the other hand, she's a single mom with a kid, and at this time she legitimately has nowhere to go and will probably end up in a shelter.

Wasn't really planned too much but it was going to be a few drinks after work and home well before midnight (train or uber, didn't organise I would pick her up). About 8pm I ask to let me know when your on your way as her friend was staying the night and I wanted to make sure everything was presentable (tidy up, make spare bed, dishes, etc), she said she was staying out til about 3am clubbing and other fun stuff. Still at this point nothing about me picking her up was organised.    
  

At 2.50am she rings me to pick her up as she says theres no ubers and the trains arn't running( lie as trains run until 5am in my city and I checked the ubers and there were about 20 in the CBD) and I reluctantly wake up and agree to pick her and her friend up. I ride my scooter to the train station to pick up our only car with enough seats (she parks at the train station for work, there was a 2 seat ute at home). I then drive to the city get there at 3.40 and ring her. She was in her work office, her friend was asleep on the floor, no answer. I wait a bit and ring again, 8 times then ring agin on facebook twice. I send multipul messages.  
 Nothing. 
  

She is an extremely deep sleeper and will sleep for an hour with an alarm blasting on the bedside table, as I'm writing this her alarm as been going off for 15 minutes. I didn't have her friends number, well I did, but it wasn't saved and it was only in my recent messages from months ago, at the time I didn't even remember this. I did think about calling the office number but I was worried it would time out and redirect to the boss's phone, this is common in my line of work so I decided against calling that number. I have the phone number of one of her collagues but didn't even consider calling them as they would be in bed asleep, and what could they do anyway?    
  

At this point it's 4.15 and decide to drive back home as, in my opinion, they are in a safe place (her secured multi story office building directly opposite the state police headquarters), and they have proobably both fallen asleep.  
  
  

I get home at 5 and she has woken up and messages and calls me abusing me, being agressive and mean, nasty, etc. I tried to explain I waited 35 minutes at 4am called a dosen times and told her to get a uber or train, 200 meter walk.  
  
Further abuse when she gets home. Her story doesn't add up, starts telling me she was in an allyway in a fight with another collague and thats why she didn't answer my calls for 35 minutes. This is a lie as she sent me a photo of her friend asleep in the office at 3am  
  
I feel like I did all i reasonably could to contact her (I don't have access to her office) to pick her up. I've copped verbal abuse from this.

I have a neighbor who gets mad when I park on the street even though it's public street parking and literally anyone can park there.

She's called the cops on me before, for parking an ""abandoned vehicle"" and they showed up and said I wasn't doing anything illegal, it's public street parking and my cars registered and legal, and they confirmed with me that I drive it daily to work. 

She told the cops to ask me to park in my garage and they asked me and I said I was using the garage as a woodworking shop, and it wouldn't fit. 

So she started leaving notes on my car, I know it's her because I have a dashcam that films motion even when the cars parked. I think she's been trying to hide who's leaving the notes cause she does it at like 2am in a hat and covid mask but it's pretty obvious on the dashcam still .

She put a letter there and I just didn't open it and drove around with it on there till it got crumpled and faded. She did it again and I left it on there till it rained and became mushy paper. I think she was getting the point I wasn't gonna read it. 

One of my other neighbors said I had a note on my car and I said yeah I know, just leave it there, the crazy lady down the street keeps doing it and I think she's getting the point i haven't moved the first few.

She asked what it said and I said I didn't know. 

She said it was kinda shit of me to not even read it. I was like ""Ehh it's kinda shit she called the cops on me, that shit is dangerous knowing how the cops are"" which my neighbor didn't seem to get? She seemed to not think cops are dangerous? Idk.

He decided to work for one of the classmates that we had which he now refers to as his “boss” (22M).

At first I was fine bc it was nice seeing him work after college bc it was a huge milestone for newly-grads. However, they started becoming intensely close even outside of work. I though, maybe it’s just a boss and personal assistant type of relationship. However, it became weirdly intimate bc he also has to accompany him during dinners, movie-watching, non-work-related-travels (fully paid), etc. My bf would even watch his boss’ tennis practice just for support all after just finishing a whole-day shift with him. On occasions, he would stay the night in his boss’ condo and would sometimes sleep in the same room.

It also became an issue between the boss and his gf because he chose my bf to accompany him in an expensive resort rather than his own gf (which was also non-work related btw). Which actually happened a lot.

His boss buys him clothes and pays for other expenses (travels, drinking, etc). He also promised to buy him cars and phones. There was even this one instance he asked me if it was okay to ask his boss if he can borrow 1 million, and I said no bc the boss might think weirdly of him.

Other than the financial gain, I think their relationship developed into something intimate. When his boss broke up with his gf, he had to be one call away bc they would have a heart to heart conversation. And when we would fight, he would call his boss regarding our problems to confide with him. When we broke up for a month, he stayed in his boss condominium for a whole straight week bc he was his shoulder to cry on.

I came out the bathrrom and when I walked into my room my mom was just standing there in the room. And when she saw me she just stared at me. 

When I walked into my room and saw my mom just standing there I blurted out "" what are you doing in my room?"" 

Hearing this made my mom mad and I could tell this made her mad because she threw a dirty look at me after I said it.

So I explained myself saying that it was weird to find her  just standing there in the room and not saying or doing anything. 

She was actually in there to give me some mail and after she told me this, she then says next time she'll wait until I come out the bathroom if she needs to give me something. 

After that she walked out visibly still angry. 

Today is Friday and since then she has been ignoring me.

My mom's has alway told me that if I see that she is mad and ignoring me, I should just apologize. 

She thinks the reason I don't apologize whenever she's given me the silent treatment in the past is because I'm too prideful.

My mother should know this by now and for a bit of added information, I am 15yrs old (female). 

My mum and dad decided last week that they were going to go out for a meal, and so obviously she had this whole time ti sort herself out. She came in my room today after we had dinner and announced that she was taking a pair of tights of mine (that are for school). She let me choose which ones but what really annoyed me is a)I didn’t have a choice when I tried to ask about hers she said she lost them and that she bought mine anyways so she’s allowed and b)we’re not the same size so mine are smaller meaning that I can tell when mine were worn(they stretch slightly) 

She then took my eyeliner out even though I said it was running low and that it only had a bit left(I like to use it quite often and if we haven’t had a chance to get a new one I am quite picky with how it’s used) and she used the same excuse that she bought it. 

And the final straw was my nail clippers. My nail clippers are one thing that I HATE people using for something other than what they’re supposed to and even then I still don’t like others using them anyway. I’d like to say that every other pair I’ve had generally ends up with her or lost even if I bought them. So I am quite picky about this because I think they are just really comfortable to hold(they are kids ones so they have a grip) and they are purple which is one of my favourite colours. And I told her I’m not ok with her using them on her lashes and she told me to just give them. I said no and we ended up in an argument and her continuously calling me selfish. My dad said nothing during this to stop it even though I was clearly getting overwhelmed by the constant asking(I don’t like it when I’ve been asked for something repeatedly when I’ve said no like anyone else and do get quite overwhelmed).

I walked away and she came in my room and told me she wanted them. I refused to hand the clippers over because I didn’t want the lashes to touch them and she got mad and stormed out. Slightly later I had to get a drink and went down stairs and she was expecting an apology. I said no and she didn’t like that and called me selfish again. This whole thing ended in her refusing to talk to me even when usually she says “I love you”as she goes out the house no matter whether or not theres been an argument. And that really hurt me.

My mum recently had surgery to get her ovaries removed due to ovarian cancer, so my grandma and auntie from Puerto Rico have been staying temporarily while she recovers. My mum has been sleeping on the couch since her diagnosis, and my grandma has been with her on the couch to make sure she's okay in the night, my auntie has been sleeping in the spare room and I've been in my room, all with no issues (that I'm aware of, though none of them really tell me if there's any issues). My mum's house is a 3 bedroom house, and my mums room has been readily available for the past 5 days.

My mum's boyfriend comes and stays at my mum's house for the weekends, and he would be sleeping in my mum's room, and my room would be empty. My mum didn't ask me if I would be okay with my grandma sleeping in my room, she just said that it would be happening and I never got told why (I'm autistic, and would fare better with reasons).

I'm not uncomfortable because it's my grandma sleeping in my room, I'm uncomfortable because I don't like people in my room, and when I get back half of my stuff is moved around (this has happened before and I was uncomfortable last time too) which usually means I forget things on Monday for school because it isn't where I last remember putting it.

I'm scared to say anything about it because my mum is always very firm on her decisions, and I don't want to cause any trouble regarding her health if I say something about it and cause her to get annoyed and make everything worse.

We've been working in the same place for a couple years. She said if it weren't for me and one other coworker – let’s call her Rachel - she would have quit the first month. This changed one day a couple months ago.

My coworkers and I eat lunch together. It's not uncommon for us to have little debates. I walked into a discussion started by another coworker. Rachel asked Jasmine, “Do you think people can be racist against white people?”

“No because they are the ones in power.” Rachel agreed with her.

I added my opinion, “I think they can be, white people don't have power in every situation or country. It might be different if we were in South Africa. Racial discrimination usually goes one way but it can go the other way, just like with sexism. I've talked to another coworker about this.”

“What did he say?” Jasmine asked.

“He said his understanding of the word ‘racism’ was any discrimination based on race, but that he had a friend who thought it had to involve systemic oppression.” I think it was around this time that Jasmine got up and left. I continued talking to Rachel, but I felt bad because it was obvious Jasmine was upset with me.

After an hour or two I went to her bench, “Do you have some time to talk?”

“Why?”

“I feel like you’re mad at me.” I whispered.

“I just want to get my work done and go home.""I was so surprised I just turned around and left. I figured she was still mad and needed time to cool down.

After I got home my fiancé told me Jasmine decided she was no longer coming to our wedding. I texted Jasmine asking, “Can we please talk tomorrow? I’ve been miserable all day thinking you’re upset with me.”

No response the next day and I guess we avoided each other. I talked to Rachel about it and she said, “What you and the coworker said invalidated Jasmine’s experience as a person of color. It's suspicious that all you who think people can be racist against white people are white men.  I think you're wrong and you should apologize to Jasmine.” I didn’t know how to apologize because I really didn’t think I was wrong.

Ever since then Jasmine would briefly talk about work questions but never talk personally. I started eating lunch alone. Once or twice she was positively rude, being reluctant to share the reagents we had always shared and rolling her eyes when I asked a question.

I talked to our supervisor about it at the end of one week. “I could tell something was off. I would suggest sending her an email saying you value her friendship and didn’t mean to offend her.” I started a draft but was so busy with work, school, moving, getting married, honeymooning, and being sick, that I never sent it.

Since we were close Usopp learned how to say ""Hiya cassie,"" or ""Hiya Alex"" I think some might know where this is going.

I keep him away from them when they visit because I just don't want to deal with either of them causing me mire of a head ache

Today was the breaking point as When they cassie and Alex came today for a surprised hangout. when he heard cassie, usopp came flying to my shoulder and said ""hiya Alex""  

She said F Off and usopp said ""Ribs"" We all thought that was weird/funny 

I chimed ""you do know its just a bird right"" 

She said I needed to retrain it to not call them that name (their words were reeducate it) I said thats not how parrots work to my knowledge but if you wants we can stop meeting at my place. 

Alex said thats not fair as I have the beast place and I cant ban them from coming over 
And just tuned around and slammed the door cassie hung out for an hour and we talked about stiff and she agreed that I'd be best to go elsewhere to hang out.

I tried to retrain usopp to not swear as he has learned some colorful words, it takes forever and I do nt think I wanted Alex in my home anymore because they just swear at my poor bird when he's around and is sad when I put him away when they do come over.

Casey said that Allison is not allowed over until she starts wearing bras. Worse she said that Kevin isn't coming over again either.

His bio-mom also had a daughter the following year who was put up for adoption. He found his sister and mother when I was around 6 years old, and we have been relatively close since. My grandma lives about a 4 hour plane ride away, so we didn't see her often, but I really loved her and when I met her I felt like there were so many similarities between her, my dad, and I, and I loved it. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about 10 years ago, and it broke my heart the first time she forgot who I was around 4 years ago. She remembered my dad until the very end, and he was always special to her. She had informed us about 12 years ago that when she passed, her will stated 25% of her estate would be left to each: my dad, my aunt, my sister and I. We are all very close and have an incredible family. It is not a small amount of money as the land her house is on is worth around 2 million$ Canadian. However, after her Alz. diagnosis, she created a second will that left 40% to my dad to disperse at his discretion, and the rest to various friends she had over her life.   


If she was of sound mind, and it is her decision, then it should completely stand. However, I have two concerns about it. First, I doubt that she was of sound mind since it was after her diagnosis and am worried that some friends of hers manipulated her. Second, several of the people she listed as beneficiaries have since passed away and her money would be going to their nieces/nephews who do not even know who she is (she flourished in the most incredible queer community, and many of her friends did not have children or families- she had a wonderful, fun-filled life!!). She passed away just a few days ago so this is on the horizon imminently- I asked/pushed my dad to contest the will, but he is hesitant mostly because of the distance/travel and the legalities and how complicated and stressful the legal battle could potentially be. Honestly, yes, the money would be nice, BUT my biggest concern is that so much of her estate will disappear to people who literally have NO idea who she is.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always had issues with clothes throughout my entire life. Style, texture, details, etc- I am very particular about what I wear! Lately I've found that I've been able to express myself by what I wear. Most of that falls into the '80s retro' or 'cottagecore' clothing- lots of mom jeans, 70s flare pants, overalls, retro print tees/rock bands tees (from the concerts I see), grandpa/sailor sweaters, and a variety of cute sundresses for the summer. I thirft often. I also wear a lot of bandanas in my hair. I am NOT a fan of heels, but will def wear em if the dress and event is formal. I wear sneaker with sundresses. I'm also not great at makeup, so I don't wear a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom loves to window shop and shop for me, which I appreciate because she's thinking about me. When I'm away at college, she especially likes to shop ahead for Christmas for me. 

However, she has absolutely NO sense of what I like. This is the same woman who I, at age 12-13, had to explain how gifts work- getting a gift for someone isn't about what you want them to have, but what THAT PERSON would like. I had to fight to explain to her that me, a 12 year old, wouldn't be weird for wearing a Captain America T-Shirt. 

&amp;#x200B;

She likes getting me: Chunky 'Christian Girl Autumn' sweaters, skinny jeans, cowgirl boots and chunky heels, infinity scarves, those dorky ass felt coats with massive buttons. 

These are NOT things I like to wear. They don't fit my style, they're often very uncomfortable, and most importantly they don't make me feel like myself. I also get angry that she's wasting money on something that'll be in Goodwill after sitting untouched in my closet for 3 years. She'd do better to buy my Lilbro clothes because he's constantly growing, but she never does. He has to buy his own. 

&amp;#x200B;

For almost 7 years now, I've been fighting with her about it. She constantly says my clothes look grungy/homeless, and that wearing bandanas in my hair makes me look like I'm not taking care of myself. I've lost my temper at her time and time again and have been strong armed by her and dad into 'being grateful'. My dad even threatened to take away my phone at the ripe age of 20 because a print tee I was wearing was 'grungy' (did it have pen on it I didn't notice? Yes. Could they have just said that? YES!?). 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the summer, my mom, lilsis and B'sGF went shopping. My B'sGF adequately stated that my mom's style was 'good for you to wear, but not for me'. Because of this, I asked my mom to text me pics of what she finds for before buying anything. Thankfully she does now, but I'm getting comments about 'but it's so you' and 'you need to think out of the box'. I feel like she's trying to push some image of who I'm not onto me. I'm sick of it.

I (f 15) got my cancer removed three days ago. The surgeons had to remove three of my ribs in order to do that (3rd, 4th and 5th). They put a net on the second rib which goes down to the sixth so that I have a bit more support on the left side of my body. However when I move a lot, like turning my upper body or standing up, that net sometimes pulls my ribs together which puts me in immense pain.
My mother (f 43) is currently with me in the hospital because she takes care of me together with the nurses. She's very christian and prays the rosary every evening at a certain time.

Now the situation starts.
I had to go to the toilet, since I can't walk or fully stand yet they bring a roll in toilet for me. I tried getting onto it but the net started cramping my ribs together, this made me gasp out in pain and I immediately sat back down on my hospital bed. My vision was blurry and breathing gave me a sharp pain to my lung and it burned, so I tried to breathe as little as possible. Since I barely got any air into my lungs at that moment I just tried saying ""pain meds"" over and over, but she had her headphones on and was listening to her rosary, so I was concerned she couldn't hear me which made me panic a lot. 
A few minutes pass and I had laid back down on the hospital bed in a position where the cramping isn't that bad and I can breathe, while a nurse was trying to figure out what pain medication to give me (i had just moved from the intensive care unit to a normal station).
I was trying to collect my thoughts and focus on the pain, but I could hear her rosary through her headphones which made me unable to focus and got me more into a mode of panic.
After I had received my pain medication I told her ""turn that shit off and focus on me when I am in pain"", because I was concerned she couldn't hear me, it made me panic and I felt like she wasn't giving her full attention to me.
This is where i might was the asshole.

She went on to big rant and basically told me this: ""I don't ever want to hear that come out of your mouth again. You do not talk about the rosary or anything christian like that! I was just trying to calm my nerves while you were in pain, I also worry. You do not get to tell me what I should and should not listen to!""

I couldn't even tell her why I said that because I was on the verge of crying again and trying to focus on my breathing so the pain doesn't get worse. 
I know she's a strongly christian woman, but I myself don't believe in god, I'm a science nerd (even though she raised me christian and we go to church every week). So I know this hurt her feelings a lot, but I also didn't know what she was listening to when I said that. I just wanted to express how upset I was that she didn't fully focus on me.

She never thinks of cleaning anything around the apartment, only time she ever does something is when I specifically tell her like I'm her mother and she's a child. I've tried to talk to her numerous times but it's all in vain as she keeps doing nothing or tries to shift the blame on me (for example I ask her why does she keep bread crumbs on the table instead of cleaning them up and she brings up how I sometimes don't wash my coffee cup right after I'm done drinking). Dozens of times I told myself I will stop cleaning too to show her a lesson but she never cares and I can't stand the mess so I end up cleaning anyways. The straw that broke camel's back happened yesterday when she told me I should put my laundry in the machine so she can turn it on because she needs clothes from it that need to be washed asap. I said ok, put what I had and turned on the machine (side note: in 3 years that we lived together she put the laundry to wash like maybe 10 times total, I always put it or tell her to put and she won't hang it to dry or pick it up unless I specifically tell her so). Washing machine was done and she did not take out the laundry to hang it to dry. I didn't either. It's been over 24 hours now and clothes are still in the machine. I assume she expects me to do it, but this time I'm trying to stay true to my decision. I also only washed my dishes from the sink and picked up only my dry clothes. This past day we barely communicated as I keep hanging out in my room. I feel like I'm passive aggresive but direct approach didn't help either. If she worked a lot I'd understand, but she mostly lays around and goes to college, just like me. When I went home to my parents last weekend machine was already full but she didn't turn it on nor picked up clean dry clothes whereas I always do that when she leaves.

The changes in my hours obviously drastically affected my pay check but I’m still able to afford the things I need and save a good amount for when I move out but this really pissed my parents off. More specifically my moms boyfriend, let’s call him Kevin. 

Now, Kevin owes me well over a thousand dollars, he has had to borrow money to keep up with bills and other essentials, which I had no problem helping with because I live here too, but he assured me I would be paid back and hasn’t really done much to try to start paying off the debt. I don’t have much of a problem with that because I know we are struggling, but I’ll admit it is slightly frustrating when he’s not putting any effort towards paying it off. I haven’t said anything about that to him though.

I had been given a weekend off (when I normally work every day of the weekend), and I planned to use it to get caught up on some homework and hangout with some friends. I’ve been looking forward to this time off for weeks, like literally since the schedule was made. 

My boss asked if I wanted a shift for that weekend but told me I didn’t by any means have to take it because it was my first weekend off in a while. She also offered me a shift for the following day which would take away my whole weekend. So I politely declined and told her I had some stuff to do that weekend but said if it was an absolute emergency and nobody else could work to give me a call.

Fast forward to today and Kevin comes home, immediately saying that my mom was “sick of lying for me” (I don’t even know what that was supposed to mean) and that I do nothing all week and I shouldn’t need a weekend off, I’m just lazy etc...

 Keep in mind, this wasn’t time I booked off, I just happened to be given the weekend off. I have no control over the weekly schedules.

He went off about how I do nothing all week and how I should be taking the extra shift because I don’t have anything better to do.

Part of me thinks he just wants me to take the extra shift because he might need to borrow money again. I don’t have any issues lending my parents money because I know it’s going towards necessity’s, but it would be nice to have just one weekend to be a normal teenager.

So we have been married for just over 30 years and I dont get along with my inlaws.  Thanksgiving is ""their"" holiday and my spouse always goes,  but for the past several years I have gotten out of going by traveling with a friend.  This year however, I dont have that excuse.    I said I would go,  but already refused to stay at their house because there are 4 bedrooms and will be about 30 people staying there, some in tents or RVS in the yard.  I am in my 60's and too damn old to sleep either on the floor, in my SIL's bed with my spouse AND  my SIL across the bottom,  or in a room with 10 or more of  our nieces/nephews, or in a tent.  We dont have an RV.   We also have 2 large dogs that we have no one to watch, and FIL  wont let animals in his house.  So I rented a nearby  Air Bnb for the two of us and our dogs.  

Now,  one of dogs had to have emergency surgery yesterday.  She will be physically well enough to travel, but is supposed to be kept indoors, only out on a leash for 2 weeks.  As I stated, FIL does not allow animals in his house,  which is his prerogative and fine with me. Usually.   

With my dog's recent surgery,  I no longer want to attend.   I dont want to leave my injured dog out in the yard and of course the Bnb, while allowing dogs,  doesnt want them left unattended when we go out.  Even if the dogs were allowed inside, there will be SO many people  ( in addition to the 30 or so that sleep there,  there will be about another 20 that come on Thursday.)   It will be a literal madhouse,  dozens of kids screaming and running around, lots of drinking by the adults, and just so much general mayhem that I dont think its a good place to take an injured dog.   

 My spouse keeps saying ""it will be ok"",  which is their standard answer to anything they dont want to deal with,  but I just feel it wont.  Spouse is now insisting I go and not change the plans.   I want to say no,  cancel the Bnb and let him go alone.

We had issues but the last straw basically finding out he had attempted to cheat on me (and I believe he prob did).  I was willing to work through it and then something else happened that led me to believe he would never stop cheating…he would just hide it better.  I had offered to have an open relationship and he said no…so the cheating really hurt.

About a month after the breakup I had dinner and drinks with a mutual friend.  I ended up telling her everything.  She said my ex hadn’t talked to her in several months so she hardly considered them to be friends anyway.  She also told me about a time my ex tried to hook up with another female friend while we were together (the friend denies it happened so I don’t know the truth).

Cut to a couple days ago.

I posted on Facebook about being a little sad to be without my ex for the holidays for the first time in several years.  To my surprise a mutual friend of the ex (a different one) popped up and invited me to their Xmas party.  

I messaged him and Told him I wouldn’t be comfortable going to a party my ex was at but that is love to get together some other time.  He replied that my ex was not invited.

I asked why he wasn’t invited (this is an annual party and he’s usually invited) and the friend said they “just didn’t want to”

Suddenly I realized what I told the mutual friend at dinner had probably spread around.  And his friends maybe don’t want to be around him bc of it.

A part of my feels vindicated bc I feel like he got what he deserves.  But another part of me feels really guilty.  He’s not someone that has a ton of friends and I hate that he would lose the ones he has.  I worry about some of his self destructive patterns. Esp if he learned that I was invited to this party and he wasn’t.
