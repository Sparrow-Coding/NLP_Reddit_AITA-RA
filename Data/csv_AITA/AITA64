So recently now I have started to notice that a coworker at the job we work at (together) has developed some kind of crush on my gf obviously she is blind to it bc she doesn’t like him in that kind of way and I’m okay with that, I’m not an insecure person and from what I know he hasn’t made any moves on her yet that is but I do catch him getting a little to close to her physically if that makes any sense, and I’ve told her I don’t like him being that close to her and she just keeps saying she “sees him as a brother” and that irritates me ngl.

But also she suspects that a few friends that I have been hanging out with at school have had some crush on me even though I’ve reassured her that they just don’t see me in that way because of the many times they have came to me for guy advice for other guys they are crushing over in school, but when she met them a few days ago she determined that they do and that I’m oblivious to it because I don’t like them that way. 

After the past few days and a few back and forth conversations I just told her I was tired of the fighting and bickering and that if she wants me to stop hanging out with my friends she will have to stop hanging out and being to close with that coworker, it’s that simple and when I said that she started to stone wall me and just said she “has to think about it.”
I’ve only told a couple of close male friends so they see it how I see it and they said I was wrong to give her an ultimatum. Now idk what to think because to me it’s simple if she drops that one friend I’ll drop the two of my friends.

We bought him a steering wheel/pedals when my sister said she was buying him a Switch for Christmas last year. We’re 3 hours away and haven’t been able to do it until now. His parents never helped him set it up which I feel bad about. My sister is overwhelmed and gets very little help from her husband. My sister knows it’s a problem but says the only option is divorce. They did therapy. My parents and I have offered support but this is her choice. As kids she ordered me around, she still tries, my parents didn’t do much about it, and now she treats my husband and I like we’re not her peers. 

When we arrived, Sam asked us to set it up which was fine because he’s a kid who’s waited a long time to play with a toy he got a year ago. I explained that we had to help with dinner so that was first and then we’d do it. He asked repeatedly in front of my sister and I re-explained that I couldn’t stop helping right now but we’d definitely get to it after. He asked about 30 times and it’s becoming a pattern where she doesn’t correct him when he does things he’s not supposed to do.

Towards the end of cleanup when I was about to do it, he interrupted which he does a lot and said he’s done waiting. He was clapping in my face and telling me that we have to do it right now. When he did that my husband said “Sam, if you ask us like that again, we won’t do it until we come next time.” He didn’t yell but he was firm. Sam was upset and a few minutes later we did set it up.

The next day I’m out with my mom and sister, and my sister let loose. She said my husband is intimidating because of his size, he was yelling, and felt that what he said was demeaning. No one agrees that he was yelling, including my dad who also spoke up. She said we’re not to discipline him and if there’s an issue we have to tell her so she can handle it. 

I asked her why adults in the family should not be allowed to tell him to stop especially when she has repeatedly done nothing. She’s responding as if my husband told him to go to his room or something in front of her when the only reason he spoke up is because she did nothing. My mom pointed out that our grandparents were allowed to tell us to stop behaviors like that. She says she’s setting a hard boundary on this because she needs to protect her child, I set boundaries all the time, and we can’t say anything to Sam period. I asked her why she lets teachers tell him what to do and she said it’s because they’re in a position of authority. She’s been doing this to my mom too.

I’m concerned I’ll get “you’re not my mommy” because he’s learning to be manipulative. My sister argues with him and seems to be having a hard time saying no. I know he’s little and he’s learning, but to allow him to order adults around and tell the adults they can’t say anything is a problem. She’s disinviting us to Christmas.

I’m talking everyone knows everyone kind of town.I met my future husband (22 M) here. At the time he still lived with his parents and had grown up in the town his whole life. I really started to like him and his friends and family. His family became my family and no one was surprised when we started dating. While we were dating I supported many of his decisions like starting a band with his friends. I also helped him when he was readjusting to life after his father returned from being deployed for a few years. That being said I think we rushed into our marriage, which happened a few months after we started dating. I didn’t see any problems with our quick marriage because I felt like a part of his family already.

Once we were married, I started to see some cracks. My husbands attitude about things changed pretty drastically. He always talked about how he missed his family even though we lived so close, and it just seemed like things he was interested in prior to us getting married were basically chores. For context, the town really loves the community aspect and has a tradition of throwing fun events in the area. We went to one event and when I asked him to join in on the festivities he gave me a snarky remark and said “I thought I wouldn’t have to participate in these stupid events now that we’re married.” I was shocked because he always loved these events prior to our marriage and these events were important to me because they were a part of the town that made me feel welcomed. We ended up divorcing pretty soon after that. We were just two different people and I had a different idea of what I thought our marriage should have been.

Someone (30 M) who was super helpful during my divorce was another member of the community who I had a good friendship with even prior to my marriage. When my divorce was making things awkward in town, he offered me a comforting presence and a shoulder to cry on. I quickly realized I had feelings for him and we decided to pursue a relationship on the down low. We ended up getting engaged. I know it was impulsive to get engaged so quickly but I really love him and we have many of the same dreams and aspirations and since I’ve known him for awhile I didn’t think it was rushed or weird. We really wanted a summer wedding and we wanted to get married in town. As I said this town is really small and there’s really only one nice wedding venue. It’s usually pretty booked with events for the summer, so there was only one option for our wedding date which was on my ex husbands birthday. Since we mended our relationship a bit I didn’t think my ex would mind but he did. I didn’t mean to get married on his birthday it was just how the circumstances played out but he is not happy.

I shouldn't be like that with my brother, he has a hard time socializing but I still don't want to take him, I feel sorry for him and he behaves very strangely and my brother start begging me to take him with me with my friends or find him a girlfriend, and told him to het his own friends and social life and now my mom thinks I’m am a bad brother AITA?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4840838,public,top,self,AITA for not inviting my brother to parties.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8v6q6/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_to_parties/,all_ads,6,,,,,

The rent was too high and we had to move back to save money to go back to the city. My girlfriend has said she is bored here; we are saving up to move back to the city but she does not have anything to do in the country. My family asks me to do a chore but its in exchange for free rent. They also bother us on the weekend with a project that is about 4 hours. I don't think its bothersome but my girlfriend does. She keeps saying I spend too much time with them and should be spending time with her instead. 

So...this game comes out and I make a promise to her that I will make time for her and our pets.

At first its not too bad; I am still ablet to spend time with her and play the game. But the game is getting ruined online  but I have been able to stay ahead of the spoilers. I keep deleting my history and cache but spoilers still come up.

During a 4 day weekend; I helped her with a project and asked that I have to play the game a full day. We both agreed; the next day I came home and instead of playing the game the house was messy so I decided to clean the whole house. She came home later surprised I cleaned the house. I told her I wanted the home to be clean before playing the game. That next morning; I said I chose this day to play the game; when getting groceries and told her. She got furious that I wanted play the game the whole day and she said wanted to watch tv together instead. I agreed but she was still angry. The next two days I did not play the game instead chose to spend time with her and family due to the 4 day weekend being a holiday. Spoilers are popping up but I am doing my best to avoid the spoilers. 

That monday night we both had everything done and she had phone call with a friend; and I played for about 3 hours. Tuesday we spent the day together and saw my family. This morning; I browsed my phone and all the websites had spoilers of the game. I cleared my search history from youtube, chrome but I still had spoilers. I told her I can't avoid the spoilers from the game anymore; a spoiler I had a theroy about was spoiled and I was right about my theroy. I was going to try to finish the game later tonight and this week. She got furious that I wanted to spend time away from her and said I don't value her time spent together. I told her I love to spend time with her; but the game is getting spoiled online and I wanted to finish the game. She said I wanted to spend time alone from her and the game was more important.

SO......Am I the asshole???

It usually isn't a big deal except for this month and last month. Last month like I said, they have been in and out of the hospital. I had to wait a little longer for payment which is fine. I understand, but this month there were some issues between management that led to an argument with the managers. Both of them quit right on the spot and waited a week to start a new job.

At the beginning of the month I sent each of them a request for their share of utilities and thought that'd be it. One roommate sent me their share, but I was still missing the other's when I paid. 

Yesterday, they told me they finally deposited the paycheck they've had since before Thanksgiving. Because banks are banks it was gonna take a couple days before it cleared. I thought that was fine but it looks like it won't be this time.

When I 23f was in elementary school the dentist told me and my mother I needed braces. It wasn’t cosmetic but because I would’ve had trouble chewing and my adult teeth all fitting in my mouth. I was too young to really get it, and my front teeth were always pretty straight. The issue is my molars were all kind of messed up. The quote was high - our insurance would cover half and my mom had to foot the rest of the bill.

I grew up quite poor and braces were kind of a big deal. My mom made me promise (again at like 10 years old) that I would ALWAYS take care of my teeth if she agreed to get them fixed.

I got them off a couple of years later and they put two permanent retainers in and gave me a nightly retainer similar to the Invisalign - clear and plastic that goes over your teeth. I asked for the metal one instead but I don’t know if the orthodontist or my mom decided that the other would be better. I hated it- I mean no matter how well you clean them they are made from clear plastic? I was really bad at keeping up with wearing it, did my best through middle school and high school but absolutely gave up on it by college.

Plus in my senior year the top permanent retainer broke and they just took it off. My front teeth shifted VERY little - really I cannot tell at all, they just sort of made themselves more comfortable lol.

But now my mom points it out often and is upset with me. She says she paid good money for those braces because I agreed to take care of my teeth. I just feel it’s unreasonable to extract a promise like this from a 10 year old and then be angry at me over a decade later because my teeth aren’t percect. Also, the molars were the issue and they are totally fine, my dentist has said nothing.

My mom wants me to get Invisalign and fix them but I outright refused. She hasn’t brought it up since Thanksgiving when I was obviously annoyed by the conversation, but I can tell she still thinks I’m being irresponsible.

The problem is the discrepancies between the gifts. There have been years when 1 will get a huge parcel of amazing things that they absolutely love, but the other received a pair of kitchen tongs.

Even though I know I'll get a very angry response, potentially making his behaviour much worse, what I want to do is tell him not to send anything, any more, ever.

My friend is visiting here in my state. His father passed away years ago and unfortunately earlier this year his mother passed away. His siblings are AHs and they aren't close. I was happy to invite him for Thanksgiving and have him as a guest while he stayed up here. He spent a couple days with a cousin before coming to my house. 

So my friend has always been the type to not pick up on social cues or do little social faux pas so I do know that's how he is but he has gotten better over the years.

We have two full bathrooms. Our main and the one downstairs right next to the guest bedroom. Our bathroom has a tub/shower combo. The guest bathroom has a shower.

When my friend got here he showed me these really two big containers of bath stuff he had and asked me if it would be OK to have a bath in my bathroom. Now I know some people are gonna say well if it annoyed you then you should have said ""no"" but in real life sometimes people are put on the spot and so I said that it was ok.

To me if I was staying in someone's house and they had a guest bathroom I would just use that bathroom whether they had my preferred shower or tub or not. Also it kind of skeeves me out because if I was taking a bath, I would want to clean it out before hand and that's with just my husband and I using it. But he is ok with it so ok for him. 

So I thought maybe he would do it mayne a handful of times but he takes a bath every single day. Again I know how sometimes he can be unaware on unspoken social rules. Or maybe I'm being extra in my annoyance.

I asked my husband if he thought it was weird that my friend has to take a bath everyday and he laughed and agreed with me.

On the brightside my tub/shower has probably never been cleaner because I've been cleaning it every day because it grosses me out to think I'm standing in whatever was left over from my friend laying in my tub.

Overall he is a good houseguest and I'll be happy to have him next year for around Thanksgiving but as we are in week two of him staying here I get more annoyed about him taking baths in my bathroom.

Now as a household with three kids, we buy gifts for three of the nieces/nephews and each of our kids brings home one gift.

The problem is that after using this system for a number of years now, the oldest of the nieces and nephews are in their mid twenties. One of them is married.

I told my wife this is ridiculous, and said she should let the women of the family (who handle the secret Santa drawing each year) know there’s a cutoff age. 18 would be good, but I’d settle for 22, since a few of them are students and still kind of kids in the sense they have no money. My wife says that since none of our kids are technically adults, she can’t be the one to make that suggestion.

I was struggling with my mental health and ended up ignoring the red flags and married him within 6 months of meeting. My fault entirely. A week after our wedding, his real personality came to light and I spent the first 2 years dealing with a physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive man who would threaten to kill me, my dogs, and ""hunt me down"" to destroy my life if I left. If the threats did not work, it would turn into him threatening to hurt himself if I walked away. So, needless to say, it was a very rough 2 years, and I eventually snapped. Since then the physical violence has stopped. Anyway, he is much better now, but when stressed or angry about the smallest things, it often turns into blaming and name calling me for it. 
So he was buying car parts on ebay and had me look over the ad to make sure it was accurate. It looked fine and the reviews were good, so he went ahead and purchased it. Well, only the hardware showed up today. Naturally, it was my fault and he this morning blew up on me and screamed that I screwed it up and I'm responsible for fixing it and getting the money back or contacting the seller. I said I will NOT do so and it is on him. That he will not treat me like crap and still expect me to bend over backwards for him. After mulling that over outside for 20 minutes, he came back in to let me know I am on my own for everything and he will not help me again because I refused to fix something so simple. So here we are.

AITA for just not going along and fixing it? It would take me 2 minutes, and I feel guilty, as he struggles with computer things and its easy for me, so I do all the finances and taxes/internet stuff. But I also feel that unless I put my foot down every time I need to that he's going to continually run me over. And I am tired of it.

problem it’s been left alone for longs periods of time while everyone is enjoy themselves; it’s important to take in consideration that we get paid hourly so I get paid the same amount of hours like the people that is going out of the gym

I was over in her country in October and she was talking about buying me a $130USD work jacket for Christmas so that I had a better warm coat. 

We went into one of their stores and I tried some on, the large was made for someone with a bigger stomach than me (I'm tall, broad and have chub but I've been prepping to start going to the gym to lose weight). I tried on a medium-tall and it was a great fit and would be a nice coat to wear. I only tried on the tan/light brown jackets as I liked them the most.   

Later that month she told me that she bought me a hoodie for Christmas and I felt confused and disrespected. She must have seen this as she asked me what was up, and I said it looks nice and I'll wear it but she had talked about this jacket for so long and made me try some on only to then buy a hoodie. I would be fine with just the hoodie for Xmas but she said she'll also get the jacket then. I thought no more of it because I really am fine with just the hoodie but I wanted to understand her thinking behind it all.   

The other night we video call and she says she's bought the jacket for me and I say ""ooh nice, is it the same style? As in thickness?"" And she says yes but she could only find a size large and sends me pictures of it and it's also dark brown. I'm completely lost for words at this point, and it's a video call so she can see my facial expression. I'm not angry, never am. I'm just thoroughly confused and slightly annoyed. I'm still hung up on the fact it's the wrong size but the fact it's a different color just makes it doubly weird.   

I asked her why she's okay with spending a lot of money on this without asking me. I don't mean this in a controlling way as we have both discussed that our money is shared, but I thought we'd agreed on a jacket for me and then she gets something completely different!   

We then had an argument where I was explaining it makes no sense to get me to try something on and then buy two things which aren't that, my wife said she would pay to get it tailored.

Things that she said which bothered me: 

* ""If its too big you can grow into it""
* ""It's practically the same.""
* ""I bought the hoodie because I couldn't afford the jacket and wanted to just get your present done."" (She has also apparently bought me some shirts with her friend) 
* ""Your mother always buys your clothes"" (she does for my birthday and Christmas and the occasional pair of jeans, but she buys my size and keeps receipts)

Before the weekend my MIL (52f) had asked my husband and I if our son (5m) would want to have a sleepover at her house after the family get together. Her 8 other grandkids (16m, 14m, 9m, 5m, 5m, 4m, 2m, 2f), 6 of her great-nephew/nieces (9m, 8m, 7m, 6m, 6m, 6m) and her 4 youngest kids (23m, 22f, 12m, 12f) would also be there. I declined for multiple reasons.

1. That's already 16 kids and 3 adults in a small 3 bed/1 bath house.
2. My son has never slept away from me with anyone other than my mom or sister and if he changes his mind or gets scared we would be 3 hours away.
3. It would require us to drive home on saturday night. Just to drive there and back again the next day.
4. To be blunt I do not trust MIL alone with my son. I know that sounds awful. She struggles with multiple mental health problems and is lucky to have custody of her twins. All of her kids have spent time in foster care growing up. She's a recovering addict and incredible eccentric in her child rearing beliefs. I have never left my son with her before.

My son had a great time playing with his cousins all day but at some point found out that there was going to be a sleepover. He then asked his grandma if he was sleeping over too, she replied ""you have to ask mommy"". This made me be the bad guy and say in front of everybody he couldn't go. It became a bigger issue when it was time to leave as he started having a meltdown over not being able to stay at MIL's with the rest of his cousins. My BIL asked why i didn't let him stay. I told him son didn't have any pajamas or a change of clothes, we had plans the next day, and i didn't want to drive back to get him. Everyone obviously gave solutions to these problems, he could burrow a pair of pajamas from cousin that lived nearby and one of my BIL offered to drive him back whenever he wanted. Everyone essentially kept ganging up on me, in front of my son, about not letting him stay. Eventually I said I don't feel safe leaving my son alone with MIL. MIL got upset and left, my husband started arguing with one of his brothers. After that we left.

I asked my husband why he hadn't backed me up sooner and he essentially said that he didn't agree with me about not letting our son stay with his mom. He said he wasn't going to disagree with me about it because he wanted to support me if it made me feel uncomfortable but doesn't mean he's going to stop people questioning me about my choice. He thinks i should call his mom and apologise for what I said.

Now my husband's family hate me more than they already did. They have never liked me and have alway found reasons to criticize me. My SIL texted my husband to tell him at the moment we won't be invited to the family gathering at christmas. 

I do feel bad for upsetting my MIL she is a nice lady and I know she loves my son.

My dad, whose been eating a steady diet of McDonalds, Burger King and KFC was not pleased by this prospect.

Back in the summer, he was being extra crabby because everything ""lacked flavour"" and was ""too dry"", and he demanded that his spaghetti have mayonnaise on it (because mayo has flavour).  I suggested that maybe I could add some more sauce and then he just lost it on me and started yelling at me that I was being ridiculous and was whats wrong with everything in his life. And then he promptly yelled some profanities at me and told me to get ""the F"" of his house and to never come back.  I told my brothers this and said that I didn't want to back and they told me that I didn't have a choice and that I needed to go back to help him out because ""nobody else is available"". So I do and Dad never acknowledge that he was wrong to yell at me nor apologized. Pretty standard.

Fast forward to last week.  Was making him food, chicken and rice, and this time when he reached for the mayo, I asked him if he would at least try the food without adding it, or perhaps we could use a salt free sauce.  Dad once again started yelling at me saying that he knows what tastes good, and then started to blame me for why he now has to go to dialysis 4 days a week instead of 3 (because lack of fat in food).  Once again, yells at me to get out.  I tell my brothers what happened and once again ""you don't have a choice you need to help him.""

Next day, I take my dads lesson with me, and I gave him a tuna sandwich for lunch, but instead of using mayo, I used last dab XX hot sauce.  He didn't say anything but he definitely knew it was in there and told me that I need to buy him mayo. My brothers told me that I was being a jerk and should apologize.

It wasn’t cosmetic but because I would’ve had trouble chewing and my adult teeth all fitting in my mouth. I was too young to really get it, and my front teeth were always pretty straight. The issue is my molars were all kind of messed up. The quote was high - our insurance would cover half and my mom had to foot the rest of the bill. 

I grew up quite poor and braces were kind of a big deal. My mom made me promise (again at like 10 years old) that I would ALWAYS take care of my teeth if she agreed to get them fixed. 

I got them off a couple of years later and they put two permanent retainers in and gave me a nightly retainer similar to the Invisalign - clear and plastic that goes over your teeth. I asked for the metal one instead but I don’t know if the orthodontist or my mom decided that the other would be better. I hated it- I mean no matter how well you clean them they are made from clear plastic? I was really bad at keeping up with wearing it, did my best through middle school and high school but absolutely gave up on it by college. 

Plus in my senior year the top permanent retainer broke and they just took it off. My front teeth shifted VERY little - really I cannot tell at all, they just sort of made themselves more comfortable lol. 

But now my mom points it out often and is upset with me. She says she paid good money for those braces because I agreed to take care of my teeth. I just feel it’s unreasonable to extract a promise like this from a 10 year old and then be angry at me over a decade later because my teeth aren’t *percect*. Also, the molars were the issue and they are totally fine, my dentist has said nothing. 

My mom wants me to get Invisalign and fix them but I outright refused. She hasn’t brought it up since Thanksgiving when I was obviously annoyed by the conversation, but I can tell she still thinks I’m being irresponsible.

They have been together for a few years now, and neither of them have ever given me or anyone else a Christmas gift at our gift exchange. My cousin is used to being the youngest in the part of our extended family who meets up for holidays, and she's always played up the ""baby of the family"" thing. She has never given me or anyone else a thank you card or anything either. She doesn't even really say thank you after opening the gifts, she just keeps tearing through all the ones labeled for her until she's done. For context, my grandma gives a gift to all the cousins, the aunts and uncles give gifts to each other and all the cousins, and I give gifts to everyone (cousins, aunts/uncles, grandma). Pretty much, I get a small gift from my aunts/uncles, my grandma, and cousins don't really gift to each other much... except for me (I always give something to everyone, including my cousin and her fiance). I don't mind that I don't get gifts back from everyone that I gift to, but I am annoyed that my cousin and her fiance have such a ""gimmie"" attitude that comes across as ungrateful when they don't give back or say a genuine thank you. My family (extended) is also big on giving thank you cards, so I make a point of sending out thank you cards to the people who give me gifts, and I usually receive a few thank yous in the mail in January. NEVER have I or my parents received a thank you card from them OR a gift at the holidays. It's annoying, and it feels like she is too old to still be getting away with the childlike ""baby of the family"" act she plays, especially now that she is engaged to be married. To clarify, I don't care how much money she spends on gifts for people. Even writing Christmas cards for everyone would be great. She does nothing but show up and collect. It's annoying and low class and not a good look in my opinion.

My dad married my stepmom 3 years ago. My mom got married to my now stepdad 2 months ago. My parent's custody agreement has always been 50/50 which worked well my parents were able to co-parent well even though they got divorced.

Before my mom married stepdad we lived in a cute 2 bedroom apartment, it was small but I liked it both my mom and I had our own space. Once mom and stepdad got married my mom moved into his house. Now, stepdad has twin daughters (8) due to family issues they live with him full-time. 

Stepdad has a 3-bedroom house. When I first went to stay at my stepdad's place I was informed I have to share a bedroom with my step sisters who are 8. When I said I thought there were 3 bedrooms I was told the other room is my stepdad's “man cave”. I was willing to try staying in a room with the twins, I tried for a whole month. It just didn't work they go to bed earlier than me and I have no privacy which is nice to have as a teen girl. 

I asked my stepdad if we could make the other room a  bedroom for me. He said he said he needed his space. So I told my mom I'm going to start staying more with my dads. I visit my mom 3-4 times a week. I go over to my mom’s (on weekdays) when I get off of school and stay over there until 1030pm so I'm over there for quite a few hours, when I'm there on weekends it's longer. 

Recently my mom has been complaining that she barely sees me anymore. I told her I'm sorry she feels that way but it isn't right I'm expected to share a room with 8-year-olds. I also said it's more understandable if we truly didn't have the room but we do stepdad is just being selfish and you’re agreeing with him instead of prioritizing my needs as a teenager.

   My grandmother(mom’s side) has literally raised me since I was a kid, because my mom and dad was working so they couldn’t take much care of me. She didn’t live with us, but she lived close and would always come to our house with yummy food. So, when I was young, I always loved her visits. But as I got older, I started to notice that my grandma was a horrible mess. 
  
  If I said something to her that ticks her off, she called my mom and lashed out at her for hours(really) yelling at her for her ‘lack of teaching her child manners’ and that would come back to me by my mom screaming at me for not behaving politely to my grandma. (I admit that I haven’t been on my best behavior tho. But I was 13. And was having a hard time in school😢)

  At first, I felt pity towards her. She has no one except my mom. So I always thought that I should be nice. But now I realized that there was a reason why there’s no one left.

  So-Few months ago, I had a huge fight with her. She said some unforgivable things to me. And I’m a very unforgiving person. If someone crosses the line, I usually just cut them off. So I don’t want to see her nor meet her. But my mom would force me to meet her. We even had dinner on my birthday. I didn’t say anything to my mom, but I was pissed. 

  Am I the bad one for not wanting to see her? I just don’t feel anything towards her now. No love, no hate . I just don’t wanna get involved with her in any sense.

While reviewing, I saw that my ex (24F) had applied for the job and made it past the initial screening. Her application was strong and she clearly put effort into it.

I suspected that he'd started on it again, although he'd told us earlier that he'd quit it completely. It had followed him smoking sometimes, instead of giving it up completely, as I'd said. Anyway, I didn't ask him anything about it, and just kept on with my stuff.

Later, I realized that he wasn't anywhere to be found, and then noticed him walking out of another room. It clearly smelled of it again, and I my suspicions increased again. I asked him whether he was smoking, and he said yes, that he hadn't been near me as I was studying. I remained there for a few seconds, and he might've known that there was something wrong (I've reprimanded him in the past about it) because he suddenly became quite stern.

I asked him how he was fine with ruining his health like that, and he asked me to just mind my own business. My mother, who was nearby, asked me to not start a fight.

He answered that I had no authority to order him around, with me claiming that I'd throw away his pack of cigarettes. 

It resulted in him completely losing his temper and giving me a full-blown lecture, and in the end I told him that if he isn't prepared to give up smoking, that he shouldn't consider me as his son anymore. In the end, though, it was a pretty bad situation, and he isn't interacting with ne anymore at all.

Today T messaged me saying he doesn’t think he can pursue the relationship further because he feels extremely guilty about betraying his friend, however he also isn’t sure he can still be his friend because of how abusive he was towards me. I think he’s confused because he has no idea how badly K treated me and has had all the information handed to him by me in only a 3 week period.

Very recently, I found out that my husband had installed a tracking device in his sister's car (he's a mechanic) while he was fixing it for her. I confronted him and he refused to tell me what was going on or expand on the situation. His sister and I are close. I threatened him to tell her and her husband but he lashed out saying that this has nothing to do with me and that I was out of line to get myself involved. He told me ""it's complicated"" that he can't say anything to me now and that I should keep my nose out of it. We had an argument and he started avoiding me saying there's gonna be an issue if I go through with my threat.

9, 14 and then Nancy is 22.

Nancy herself has a 1 almost 2 year old and another on the way, which is relevant.

Nancy has always been a perfectionist, to the point of anxiety and stress: she’ll often overwork herself, pushes herself too much or stretches herself too thin (when she went to school she struggled to fit gymnastics, cheerleading and dance on top of her classes) me and my husband always thought she overworked herself, and she’s continuing to do that (she wants to be a doctor or psychologist, she hasn’t told us yet)

We know she’s been struggling with health lately, we haven’t seen her because of it; chest infection and tonsillitis at the same time…

We saw her at the start of the week and she looked like death, she’s usually quite tan but she was so pale! And so thin, and then bags under her eyes even had bags…she was essentially falling asleep on the spot, so we told her to go into the living room to sleep.

Her boyfriend was in and out asking for help with their child, it got to a point where we just told him to go stay with his parents because she was so unwell, we genuinely considered taking her hospital because she was so out of it (she still is) she’s slept most of this week, that’s how sick she is.

Problem is Nancys boyfriends parents have been on my case because we kicked him out of his house, I wouldn’t have if he were being supportive of Nancy but he wasn’t! Apparently it’s not my place etc, they even called me a helicopter parent…my husband agrees with me, but my eldest (14) says she thinks I overstepped.

It was very expensive, about $2 million. I’m not saying that to brag, it’s an important detail.  
Of course, my parents want my family and I to visit them. My husband and I are in our early 40s and I’m currently pregnant. Their house is lovely, but there’s a huge problem: The guest bedroom where we stay has no air conditioning and it’s extremely hot. We’ve stayed in the past and I’ve literally been awake all night sitting in my sweat. We’ve brought fans, which makes a small difference, but honestly not much.   
Given how expensive the house was, I asked them why there wasn’t air conditioning in the guest bedroom, given that the rest of the house had A/C. They laughed and said they weren't sure, something about the system not working quite right. They said it’s not a priority for them to fix because they don't’ spend any time in the guest room and they don’t want to deal with having contractors at the house.  
I told them how actually it’s quite hot in the room and would they mind if I brought a window A/C. They were EXTREMELY against this and forbid it, saying it would damage the window. 

I’ve more or less dropped it because it’s not my house and not my business. However, we’ve been having this conversation for more than a year and it’s gotten to the point where my husband and I visit much less because its so incredibly uncomfortable and we don’t sleep at all. They are well aware of the problem. They’re annoyed that we won’t stay with them more, but haven’t done anything to fix the issue.  
Over Thanksgiving, I called and asked if the A/C situation had changed. They laughed and said no. I told them, no big deal, but my husband and I will be staying at a nearby hotel. My parents were furious and told me I’m being a huge asshole about the situation and that Christmas is about spending time with family.

I have already traveled home 4 times this year, which is a massive feat both financially and in terms of having any sort of personal life after sucking up all my PTO on visits home. 

My family disapproves of me “leaving the circle” and living outside of our small town but I bend over backwards to be there when it matters. 

Anyway - I learned that my sisters bf is planning to propose over Christmas, and he wants us all to be there to celebrate afterwards. I had no plans to travel home for Christmas since I’ve already been here 4 times this year and really want to spend it with my own bf in our home. I constantly miss out on forming my own traditions because my bf and I are always traveling here. I love my family but I don’t feel I need to be present for every single holiday and every person’s milestone. 

I communicated to her bf and my family that I would love to be there for them but it’s too big of a financial strain to make another cross country trip on short notice, pay for boarding for my 2 dogs, hotels, cars, plus not get paid bc I’m out of PTO. 

No one seems to care, and her bf just keeps sending me screenshots of available flights saying “that’s not even expensive, stop making excuses.” 


This makes me resent everyone so much. I could fly home 190 times each year and it wouldn’t matter to them. They will view me as an outsider unless I move home, leave my big career, become a stay at home mom and buy a house next door to the family like “I’m supposed to.” 

And they will make sure not to let me forget this if I decide not to fly home for the 5th time to celebrate this.

I guess when I grew up he could no longer pretend I was a boy and started to call me names a dad shouldnt call his daughter. It affected me so much and I only became better after moving out for college.

My father wanted me to go to a local college so he no longer need to spend money on me. But I insisted on a famous university and I passed. It was the university my uncle got into. My uncle was so proud he paid for all my college fees and allowance. It was in college when I fully realized that my dad is not a good dad no matter how good he was to my brothers, he was not to me. I no longer wanted to gain his favor or approval. I graduated at 20 &amp; got a good paying job right away. I was earning well compared to my brothers &amp; after 2 years I have decent savings. Then pandemic happened &amp; I got another job that allowed me to work from home to help my mom look after my dad who already started showing signs of cancer.

Where were my brothers? Tom have a family. Rod is an engineer. My twin is living his life in the city  working his low paying job. They often called but didnt offer any help. In my case, I only helped because of my mom. I only did what was right and what a good daughter should do. The care &amp; help I did was out of obligation and not because of love for him. I played the supportive, dutiful daughter.

My dad wanted to take a huge loan for his hospitalization and place it in my name only  and not with my brothers. His reason was because I was a girl. He said my brothers shouldn't take the loan since they will be the providers of their family unlike me. I couldnt describe how angry and frustrated I was. Even after all the help and care I gave, after all the mistreatments. 

I didnt agree on taking the loan, I will be in huge debt and my savings are now gone. The doctor already informed us that he only had months and the treatments will do more harm than good. It is not practical. Instead of using the funds on treatments why not use it to make him  a bit more comfortable. That way, the needed money would not be so huge and I could still afford it and not be in debt if he really insisted that I would be the only one to shoulder everything and not my brothers. I know his situation is very disheartening and maybe he is just desperate. But I cant believe that even in his last months, in his last days, he still cant treat me the same as my brothers.

My husband and I just welcomed our baby boy 6 weeks ago. My husband has been complaining about not spending enough ""alone time"" with our son to bond. He says that we need to be eqaull in having him but I feed him and change him and I do it several times a day/night. My husband thinks I'm using this as an excuse to get full advantage but I'm not.


He started spending time with our son in the room. Thing is, he'd demand I leave the room and close the door. He says he doesn't want me there when he's bonding with our son but I can't help but be worried when my son is out of sight, just to note, my husband is still ignorant in terms of caring for our son and so our son needs constant watch.


Yesterday, my husband was with him int the room and the door was closed. I was in the living room cleaning when I heard my son cry. I rushed to the room and checked on my son. He was most likely too hot and I removed the blanket to let him cool off. I told my husband I wasn't feeling comfortable having our son out of sight and told him I'd leave the room but the door needed to be open. He told me to ""close the door"" and I just blew up at him. He got offended and called me bossy and selfish and said that he's the parent too and I shouldn't be standing over him or watch from a distance during his bonding time.

I work in their service department doing scheduling, parts ordering, and general office coordination for the department and techs. The department is open 8-5, M-F.

Recently I moved about 60 miles away from the office due to being unable to afford to live in the same county as my job. I was previously staying with my parents and while they didn't throw me out, I could tell it was time to go. I take an hour and a half train ride in every day just to get to the office and the same going home. Before doing this, my boss agreed to let me leave 15 minutes early and take a short lunch. The train I need to take leaves at 5:05 and the last half hour a day is usually pretty quiet and mostly used for wrapping anything lingering and more often used to shoot the shit with co-workers.

Now he's asking me to stay all the way until 5 because we had an angry client call at 4:55 demanding immediate service and nobody was there to give it as my other 2 office mates were also out of the office that afternoon. We had a temp to help with the busy season but they fired her with no replacement in mind because she was annoying a co-worker. (Not anything serious, he just didn't like her attitude)

Now here's the thing. The next train doesn't arrive until 5:30 which means I'll sit at the train station for half an hour doing nothing in order to be here to answer the phones just in case someone calls. In addition, we have an after hours emergency technician on call for situations. Any time someone calls that late in the day, that's who we'd send as all of our other techs have gone home for the day. Any client can call after 5 and get emergency service same day.

I realize it sounds petty but currently I get home about two and a half hours before I have to go to bed so that extra half hour of sitting around at a train station is 20% of my nightly free time. I'm already pretty stressed from the lack of time to rest after work and this just feels like too much to me, especially because my wife has a similar commute in the OTHER direction. We'd really like to make the most of what we do have.

Meaning that here, female rights, child protection and mental health awareness are way worse than you could imagine. That really leaves lots of effects on certain individuals, especially senior ones like my mother (52, f).

Growing up, we were never really close. Mostly because she is a strict traditionalist, and I kept struggling with the issues mentioned earlier (mental health issues, verbal abuse, potential future forced marriage). Things that she's unknowingly playing a huge role in.

I understand this goes with 'intergenerational trauma' and that she's doing that because she, herself, faced similar situations, but I can't find it within myself to accept that as an excuse for her actions, considering that I tried to explain to her my point of view and how the world is changing and I did try to communicate my emotions in a healthy way.

I know she's struggling herself, in many other ways. She's quick to have mental breakdowns and cry for hours over the simplest stuff. Sometimes, it really gets on my nerves because when I'm facing her exact problems I never tear up like that. 

The problem is that she always goes to me for comfort (I'm the only other female in the house) and I really hate the sound of her crying. She's still my mother, and I can't stop loving her, but just her crying gets on my nerves. It makes me even more uncomfortable living in this house than I already was before.

I'm not good with comforting people either, but whenever I try to say something it always backfires and I get to hear a new set of gaslighting/internal sexism that I can't stand hearing. Sometimes, even her presence in a bad mood just fills me with so much annoyance and dread.

I don't want to sound like a selfish brat, but I didn't sign up to cure a century-old family trauma situation.

\-Work function on the upcoming 10th (also after bedtime)  
\-Cabin trip with a friend over the weekend of the 17th  
Granted we have a little one that we put to bed at 7:30 in the evening so it gives us BOTH a time to kind of plan things if we want to...even if it's right after work, I've told her to just plan things with friends and I will take care of our 3 year old so you can have some you time...when I plan things its usually after bedtime so that she doesn't have to be with him by herself. Even on weekend I've told her to plan things with friends. 

She proceeded to tell me that she feels like she doesn't have any friends that want to hang out with her since she's become a mom...which isn't true. She told me in the past to plan things with friends and now I have been when it's been convenient for her (usually after Hes down for bedtime so it doesn't burden her) But I've told her plan whenever with her friends and I will take care of him...but she doesn't plan anything even though there's more than enough time to plan things with her friends if she wants to.

Idk I feel like I'm being told to do something (make plans with friends in the evening to hang out, because I really never made plans before since I have always felt the need to be home to help), and then getting attacked for doing it. Is it my fault that she doesn't want to plan anything for some mommy alone time with her friends when I'm more than capable of taking care of our kid for the evening/day that she plans it?

One of my new coworkers ""Sandra"" (late 20s) is due to give birth to her first child any day now; she was close to going on maternity leave when I started there. One of my other team members had the idea of putting together a small gift basket for her that we could gift her during our weekly team meeting, and I happily participated. 

As a mom of two myself, I know a little of what she's about to face as a new parent. And while I would never intentionally kick someone off their personal Cloud 9, I also know those early postnatal days/weeks can be a gritty reality check. There's pain and discomfort, endless hand sanitizing, rushed showers and never enough sleep. I also know that expecting parents are often showered in cutesy baby-related gifts – everything from stuffies to onesies to bespoke nursery decorations. 

I remember actually tearing up when someone gave me something \*just for me\* to celebrate the birth, even if it was something relatively impersonal like a magazine or a bar of chocolate. From my own experience, the best baby-related gifts were actually useful gadgets, like formula containers or dummy cords. So because I don't know ""Sandra"" very well, I bought some neutrally-scented hand cream to soothe overly sanitized hands (diaper changing is no joke!), luxury shower foam to make even a three-minute rush job feel nice, and lanolin cream to help her recover between feedings.

Her dad said she'd be allowed to go on student housing, only if she'd share it with someone else because then it'd come out cheaper (we checked it, and it does).

She has the budget for her own room, but they're the kinds that are in a bad state and she'd have more comfort and it'd be cheaper if she shared a good quality room with someone else. She asked me if I wanted to share a room with her and at first I was on board with the plan. Later, I changed my mind.

The thing about my friend is that she has a very strong personality. Which has its good and bad sides. She is really supportive and caring, something that I greatly appreciate about her. The downside to it is that she has very strong emotions that I sometimes have a hard time dealing with. She's in a relationship but it's complicated at times. Mostly because of the guys' parents that are very strict. I get that, and I try to be there for her but the problem is is that she keeps complaining about it. Every second of the day. She also talks about it in a very angry way, like almost yelling. The only thing you can do is listen because she does not take your advice.

I have found myself in conversation with her multiple times growing tired of it because of the complaining. I mentioned that she complains about her relationship, but she complains about pretty much everything that bothers her. I'm sorry but I can't deal with every issue she has, I'm not a therapist. I know I sound like a bad friend, but this has been going on for a long time now. I've also noticed that I'm not the only one who thinks this. Mutual friends of our friend group have expressed the same feelings about her behaviour.

I don't know if I will be able to live with someone like that. I want to be more independent and not spend my days worrying about her problems, it also makes me physically tired. She was also planning on going on student housing with her boyfriend first but that plan didn't work out because of his strict parents. That's why I also feel like the last option because she hasn't mentioned it to me since now, a few months after she fell out with her other best friend.

Covid hit us hard, and both me and my bf were let go from our well paying job. We went from being able to go on a vacation once every 3 months to saving every last bit of our income. Right now, my bf is working as an engineer, and we're able to pay our bills while have some to save for our wedding. But I really miss the day I was able to buy branded clothes, bags, etc.

My bf has a gaming room in our appartement, and I always think how childish of him to still playing video games. I went into his gaming room and I saw collection of games, from cartridges thingy to playstations, and then I wondered ""How much did he pay for all of these?"". I googled one of the game, google said that it's worth about $3,000! I then decided that it's time for him to let go of his childhood and move on into adulthood.

He went on a business trip for about two weeks to Manila, and after he left I took a picture of everything and posted it on facebook, someone offered $15,000 for all of the games and consoles which I happily took. I used the money to buy our needs like clothes, and some gym equipment.

After he came back, I happily welcomed him and told him everything I did, I thought he will be happy but I was wrong. He rushed into his gaming room only to see his games are replaced by gym equipment. He blew up on me, and I've never seen him so angry like that. I told him that he need to grow up and stop playing video games and plus we need the money, which made him more angry.

He decided to went to his brother's place, the next day he texted me that we're done, and he already called off the engagement. Just like that, he didn't even wanted to talk over it first, I tried to call him multiple times but I got blocked. I tried to come over his brother's place, but his wife stopped me.

So reddit, after hearing my side of the story, will you still label me as TA?
