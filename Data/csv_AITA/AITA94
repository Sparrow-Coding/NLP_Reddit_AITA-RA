I (26yom) have been under the weather lately, got off my 24hr shift yesterday (firemedic at busy metro dept), working off 3 hrs of sleep made it to our turkey day celebration and toughed out the day despite feeling sick and having little sleep. When we got home, my wife told me that I could sleep in the spare bed and sleep in until noon. I went to sleep, however, I struggled with sinus pressure and a pulsing headace so I drank an inappropriate ammount of nyquil. My son wakes me up early to wish me a happy birthday, I tell him thank you, let daddy sleep please. He comes in again as soon as I fall asleep and asks me to wake up, I tell him I'm still tired. I fall asleep again and he comes in asking for the charger for mommy's tablet. I gave it to him and went back to sleep. Once I fall asleep he comes in again and tells me mommy made breakfast and wants me to wake up, this is at 10. So I come up stairs and tell her what I've experienced so far today and she got defensive and told me I was lying, that there was no way all this happened and told me that I woke up in such a shitty mood that I'm ruining the day. Texts go as follows after verbal conversation: 
 Me: Drop the attitude for 1 day please.

Her: I'm not letting you walk all over me just because it's your birthday. 
We all woke up early so we can make today specail gor you. 
My mistake.
Night.

Me: Walked upstairs for 5 minutes already got called a lair and yelled at. 

Me: He came in 4 times idk why you're so defensive about that.

Her: Just go to sleep john. I'm not putting up with this. kay night  

Me: When I come up drop the attitude please my day is already off to a shitty start with this God damn sinus pressure, headache congestion and living alarm clock and snappy wife. 

Her: HA! yea that'll definitely make me ""Drop"" my attitude.
Why don't you see how you treat people. Maybe I'll be nice if you treated me well. 


Me: Consider I am not lying because I have nothing to gain from lying and put yourself in my shoes for a moment . 

Her: life is so hard. Go to bed. 

Me: Look at how you're texting me... I'm just telling you my experience today and how I feel and you're trying to just make me feel worse. ""Life is so hard""...  ""maybe I'll be nice if you treated me well""... ""Kay night""... ""yup hard to argue with someone who's always right.""... ""Just go to sleep John."" ""Night"". How would you feel if I spoke to you like this just because you told me you're tired and william keeps waking you up?

Her: Again hard to argue with someone who thinks he's always right. 
I have no energy for this. I've don't absolutely nothing wrong. &amp; I'm at peace with that. you can try to blame me for you nasty attitude that's fine. 

Me: I never said anything nasty... just that I kept getting awoken by Will. You on the other hand, well refer to quotes in previous message.

This got me envisioning myself in her shoes and how I would feel if it were my dad; I realized that I wouldn't be sad. I’m not heartless as I am overwhelmed with sadness and dread when I imagine it being my mom.

My parents have this rule that all children must greet them with the Islamic greeting when coming into the living room after waking up/ coming from outside. Aside from this greeting, my dad and I could go months without talking unless there’s an argument; I build up the courage to greet him after and he’ll ignore it. If I don’t do it, that’ll lead to another argument.

He rarely calls me by my name and refers to me as ‘girl’ or ‘that girl you birthed’ (to my mom). This hurts as he refers to my siblings by name regardless of gender. My mom told me he didn’t have bad intentions. I addressed it in an argument with him and how it hurt me but he continues.

Regarding our arguments, he is verbally aggressive and hovers over me shouting. This is very intimidating, and I can never seem to defend myself. I try to avoid these arguments but it’s inevitable. i.e he shouted at me in the parking lot of a supermarket for ‘hating the hijab’ as I chose to use my jumper to cover my hair. I was just being lazy for a grocery run and didn’t care about my appearance-wise. Once I was tired during exam season and barely left my room as I was revising and got shouted at again. By the intensity of the arguments you’d think I went to the club or had a bf.

It was also my (f16) birthday so besides thanksgiving we also had a whole birthday moment. 

My family celebrates thanksgiving at my grandparents' house. One person being there is my Aunt (f30) and her daughter/ my cousin (f8). My aunt had 4 miscarriages before her daughter was born, so when my cousin was born my aunt made it a big deal which is fine. But it has led her to spoil her daughter so much and now acts like a brat because of it. If my cousin doesn’t get her way she’ll throw a fit. My cousin is also the last born of this generation of the family so my aunt has made it a point that her daughter is the princess of the family and she should get all this attention because she is special. My whole family just lets her think that way because they know how hard it was for her to have those miscarriages so her daughter is special to her. 

So as I was saying yesterday was also a birthday celebration for me besides thanksgiving. While most extended family members give me money or gift cards for my birthday my grandparents always give me actual gifts so they were sitting out for me. My cousin started throwing a fit that nobody got a gift for her. So my Aunt asked if my cousin could help me open my gifts I agreed. Well, she got mad that it was nothing she liked and ended up throwing and breaking a new makeup plate I got. My aunt said she didn’t mean to but did agree to buy me a replacement one. 

Then it was cake time and everyone started singing me happy birthday cousin yelled no and blew out the candles as we were trying to move the cake farther from her she completely smashed my cake. By then I was upset it’s hard enough having a birthday on a holiday but now I’m having it ruined by a bratty kid. My aunt started saying cousin didn’t mean to and that she was still little. 

So I said she should know better I get your daughter is special to you because of the miscarriages you had but she isn’t a baby anymore, instead she is a brat. So stop using she’s your special little rainbow baby as an excuse and learn to accept you’re raising a spoiled brat. My aunt instantly started crying and went upstairs.

My youngest cousin is in her 20’s, we have a very close family. A few years ago her and I were even going to be moving in together. Her, myself and another cousin even got matching tattoos a few years back. 

Plans change and she decided to join the Air Force. We all supported this decision, and thought she had a great career ahead of her.  

Now quite a few members of my family have also been in the military, and they warned her not to fall for someone who is her superior in the service. Of course that’s what she does, meets a guy 10 years older than her who has already been divorced once before. No one tells her not to be with him and we support it and tell her we will always be here for her. She then decided to move across the country to live with him near his family, once she left she sort of cut off contact. We can try to reach out and won’t get a message back for months. 

They then get married, but don’t invite anyone from her side of the family. They then get pregnant and have a child. Again most of our side of the family have never even met her child and he’s now 3. 

Flash to today. She came into town for thanksgiving, but decided against visiting with our family. But today (the day after) she wants just myself and my mom to come visit her for a few minutes. 

My problem is that she had the chance to see the whole family yesterday. They miss her and want to meet her son. I just feel so conflicted about going to visit her when she ignores everyone else and now refuses to come to family functions.

Long time reader, first time poster.
 
Since the pandemic I (35F) work hybrid from home/at the office. I’m only required to go in one day a week and it’s really flexible and I like the balance.
 
At home with me I have my wife and toddler (aged 2). My wife works shifts inc weekends, whereas I work during the week only. This means that some weekdays it is only me in the house (with everyone at work/nursery) and other days we are all in the house together.
 
Recently, I don’t know what it is but working from home has been increasing difficult. The instance I wanted to mention happened earlier today. I said this morning ‘I have a skype call at 9am’. At 9:15, wife and toddler came upstairs – wife goes to the bathroom – toddler manages to open my door and barges into my ‘office’ (our spare room). To which my wife shouts ‘I’m just in the loo’, and results in me having to apologise to my boss/colleagues who are listening to this unfold over skype… I’m just lucky it was a call with people who didn’t mind the interruption and not with an external party.
 
Afterwards, when I went downstairs I said something to the effect of ‘well that was a bit of a nightmare wasn’t it?’, expecting an apology but the reply I received was ‘well, people expect this when working from home. I needed the loo. And he lives here too’. I said that I’ve never once complained about the noise (he’s a VERY noisy toddler); I just expect for him to not be in the room with me when I’m on a call and I need to still be professional when working from home. She could have left him playing downstairs while she nipped to the bathroom (we have baby gates and our house is babyproofed enough to leave him for a few minutes).
 
I told her I would be working from the office all the days they are at home in future, as this is just the last in a list of clashes we’ve had about me working from home. As much as it benefits me in a lot of ways I cannot deal with the arguing anymore as I feel she really doesn’t understand the pressures I have working from home (her job is purely office based and always has been). I don’t want to do that, I prefer to work from home but I don’t feel like there is much choice. She thinks I’m being overdramatic.

I cannot afford for that to happen. It would cost me my friendships and potentially my apartment.

My apartment-mate is claiming that she has the right to be there because she pays equal rent (which is true), but our rental contract states that abuse cannot be heard from the apartment or we will be evicted, and I believe this may happen when England lose the soccer match. 

She claims she has nowhere to go in the city (she moved here just 3-4 weeks ago), but I don't see how that is my problem? There are plenty of bars around, some of which will allow her to be racist.

To understand this story you only need to know about two of them, Ella \[14F\] and Riley \[14F\]. Me and Ella are closer than I am with his other friends, we get along fine and I know her outside of her being his friend.

Now Riley and me have some very important context, she actually borderline sexually harassed me last year, a few of his friends jokingly hit on me, but she took it to far, making really uncomfortable comments, and it ended with her sitting on my lap without permission, I blamed myself for a while becasue I just laughed or smiled awkwardly, I am autistic so I have trouble talking and do this in hard situations, this also made it harder as I only let people I really know touch me, and normally only if they tell me first. The worst part is she only sat on me after my brother had told her to stop many times and that it made me super upset.

It ended when she apologized (very half hearted and smiling, I forgave her anyway), this was a few months ago, I avoid her and we do not talk, but I never reported it (it happened at school)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, onto what has happened now, Riley is bullying Ella, all because for three days when Ella was ill she did not message anyone back when they asked if she was ok. Today this all got out of hand and Ella locked herself in a bathroom's crying, very distressed. My brothers friends are aways arguing and have some sort of drama, I always stay out of it, but this is more than just drama now and had turned into Riley bullying Ella in a very extreme way.

The school has done nothing and I hate to see her so upset, would I be the AH if I spoke to Riley, told her what she did was basically sexual harassments (which my school has a zero tolerance policy about, so she would at the least get in a ton of trouble and her parents told.), and that she can either leave Ella alone, and they would never speak again, or I will report her for what happened.

Sarah had a job for about a month earlier this year but then quit and has refused to look for another job since then. My problem with this is that she expects everyone to just continue spending their money on her when there is nothing preventing her from working and making her own money. My mom was overseas for about two months and during this time I was expected to buy groceries and cook for Sarah. If she wants Starbucks or outside food, she expects me to buy it for her. She also expects me and my other two older sisters (who live on their own) to buy her other random things she may want (shoes, clothes, computer, etc.)

I have been getting very fed up with her because I am having to take care of her, but she always has a terrible attitude. No one can ever talk to her without her having an attitude. When I've complained about her attitude to my other sisters, they tell me to have more sympathy because Sarah has depression and she didn't have the best childhood. We grew up in a very sheltered home, so we were not allowed to hang out with friends outside of school, so Sarah was always stuck at home like the rest of us. I am beginning to lose my patience with her because she uses her depression as an excuse to behave badly towards everyone else. Neither of us really had a great childhood because we grew up with parents who stayed married despite hating each other.

The other day, me, Sarah, and our mom were heading back from the store and we had stopped at a gas station so I could get a cup of ice because I have ice cravings. When we pulled into the drive way, my dad was outside so I asked Sarah if she could put the cup in her nearly empty Walmart bag (I didn't have a bag of my own to put the cup in) because my dad gets mad when I eat ice, and I didn't feel like listening to his griping. Sarah starts huffing and puffing and rolling her eyes. I asked her what's wrong and she just ignores me and keeps rolling her eyes. So at this point I lost it. I told her I'm not spending even a penny on her anymore and to not expect anything for Christmas from me. 

My sisters and my mom told me I'm being mean. My mom told me to just buy her gifts this year and then next year I don't have to buy her anything. I told her no because next year she's just gonna tell me the same thing.

I just ignored him and continued what I was doing, but eventually, he walked over to my computer hard drive and swept it off my desk, the desktop fell and shattered, I did get aggressive here, and started to have a meltdown of sorts myself. 

I thought I fixed it but my computer wouldn't turn on, I worked to save for a gaming computer with my own money during my last year of high school, and It's around $3000, I'm also pissed because I've created a fictional world and planned on writing a book set in it, I've been working on the world since I was 13 and a lot of the data was on there. Thankfully a decent amount is still on the cloud, but a lot of things I will never get back, and they're important resources, I created my own languages and I had translation charts that are now lost.

Short backstory, she is extremely religious and does not respect my choice to be secular. My mom doesn’t have family in this country so she was very excited to have her over last week. She asked me if we can get together and I agreed because I feel bad that she’s always alone here. My mom is the type of person that’s good in small doses. The issue was last week, when I had enough of her BS when she wanted to come over to my house in the evening. Mind you, I have children who go to sleep early and go to school. I told her that day wouldn’t work out as they also had extracurricular activities after school and we would not be back until right before their bedtime and I’d like the kids to see her (my mom) as well. She doesn’t make much of an effort to come over because she’s too busy shopping other days. Anyway, we agreed for her to come the next day at 4pm right when we got back home from school, so the kids have enough time to see her. She agreed. I reminded her why it had to be that time (bed time, school) and she kept agreeing that 4pm was fine. A few hours before school ended, I confirmed via text yet again and she told me she was out shopping with my cousin but she will be here at 4pm. We get home and I’m thinking IM late since it’s 430 (picked up food), but it would be fine since my husband was home anyway. Then 5 pm came along and I’m wondering where she is. No communication from her side. I text her and she sends a voice message acting surprised like she forgot. Tells me she’s so busy shopping but she’ll be here when she’s done shopping. I snapped and asked her wtf!? She acted confused and asked me to call my dad because he wants to come as well. But I tell her I made the plans with HER and he’s waiting for HER to pick him up. What good would it be to call him when he can’t do anything about it? So she tells me “ok, ok I’ll just go tomorrow” and I told her I just spent so much money on food to entertain her and her idiot niece TODAY! anyway, I told her to forget about it.My dad was also upset but asked me to speak to her because it looks bad that we’re fighting because she’s my Mom and I should See my cousin. I told him that I don’t care that she’s my mom, she has no respect for me so I don’t feel inclined to speak to her or keep trying to entertain her BS. My older sister feels and has been feeling the same way as well. She even told my older sister that she wants nothing to do with me, like I did something wrong. I guess she’s angry that I did not make an effort to see her idiot niece past that day.  It sucks because my kids want to see her but she makes little to no effort. I feel like it’s a one way street with her and it’s hurtful. I honestly feel better not speaking to her than to remind myself how disrespectful, selfish and careless she is.

So I wasn't really able to spend time on other stuff like friends, my mom wouldn't let me go out if I didn't finish my school stuff.. I was told from teachers I'm dumb. I always wanted to study literature or something in this field, because I loved reading and writing stories.  I ended up working with handicapped people. Don't get me wrong, I do love my job but it's not that fulfilling. All just because I always got told how stupid I am. Now (34 years old) I was diagnosed with adhd... no-one ever thought about it during my childhood.  But sister got always the support because she's so smart (she never finished her school, has no job)

Since I can think of I struggled with my eating. I wasn't really able to eat in public or even with my family. So I always stealth food and eat it hidden in my room. I also eat too much, just to make me feel anything.  I was just punished for this. Like being grounded or something else. My sister is the opposite. She always refused to eat. Oh what wonder, they all ran and tried to help her. They bought her everything she wanted.. just because she's sick. She got a horse,... all this... me just punishment, cuz she's sick and I'm just acting out. She got diagnosed with maniac depression while I struggled with depression, but I was told just tried to get attention.

While I still was still there my dad gone on wellness holiday with his new girlfriend. I lost so much weight cuz I wasn't able to eat. The only person who really support me during this was my granny and boyfriend. 
So I was finally home 1 week before my 30th birthday.  I spend my birthday alone at home. No-one cared. 

My sister got a apartment. They paid all the pills and debts she made. All i want i need to work for. I drive with a car that isnt really safe. But I need it cuz to come to work. 

Now my granny has her 80th birthday.  We gonna celebrate Big with the whole family. They made a whatsapp group.. After few days they realised that they forgot to add me.  

My sister always was really welcomed with open arms from my whole family.. every time I visit it feels like they just accept me..but aren't really happy that I'm there.

Yesterday, during Thanksgiving dinner with her family (who, let me say are extraordinarily conservative and were against us being together as we’re an interracial couple), her dad and I were discussing politics and, while I don’t agree with everything that he thinks about our nation’s polity, he made some interesting points that I thought were more in line with my/our views. The gloves came off, my fellow potential a-holes. 

Let me just say, I am of the opinion that even if you’re right about something, you can be wrong about how you come off to others about it. And if you can’t be nice when you speak, then don’t speak at all. It’s just the way I was raised. 

I don’t strictly disagree with what she said, but in the back and forth banter of it all, she said, verbatim “Oh that’s right, I forgot, you’re always right about everything.” Read all the sarcasm that there is folks. Now, my wife and I have an agreement about presenting a united front, particularly in front of her folks, because they’re the sort of people that will use any conversation had with them as ammunition against you in a later conversation. So I was very taken aback by that statement as 1) I’m not passive, but I’m sure as heck not the person that has to be right all the time and 2) shock factor that we’re going to have to deal with her folks about that statement later at some point.  

I admit, my response may be a-hole worthy. I calmly said back to her “Babe, you can be right about whatever it is we’re talking about and not be a smartass about it in front of your family.” 

Long story short, she’s not talking to me at the moment. I don’t feel guilt per she except that maybe I threw more fuel on the flame with her family, but what do you guys think.

My (18f) dad and stepmom to be wanted me to go with them to my grandmother’s house for thanksgiving. I hate my entire extended family on my dad’s side and they feel the same about me. I knew the entire situation would just be super stressful and I didn’t want to go but knew my family would probably try to force me.

The morning of thanksgiving I left early before everyone was awake and went to my friend’s house. I got a call when they woke up asking where I was and I said a friend’s house but wouldn’t specify which one and my dad reminded me I had to be back home by two to get dressed and get ready to go. I said I know. Then two hours before it was time to go I texted my dad saying I wasn’t going and then turned off my phone. My friend and I left the house and went for a hike in case my dad came looking for me. Two came and went and I didn’t turn my phone back on and ended up having thanksgiving with my friend’s parents who were more than welcoming. It was the best thanksgiving I’ve had in a while. 

When I turned my phone back on I saw a ton of missed calls and texts from my dad, stepmom, and extended family. All wanted to know where I was and when I was going to get to my grandmother’s house. I turned it off again and ended up staying the night with my friend.

Well I went home an hour ago and my dad and step mom to be blew up at me and said that I embarrassed them by not showing up and worried them when I didn’t come home and they tried to take my phone so I just turned around and left again and ended up back at my friend’s place again.

My friend’s mom told me she understood I was stressed but that I was a bit of an asshole for not texting my parents that I was spending the night (she thought I had) and that any parent would react that way when their kid showed up after a night MIA.

I (23 yo) have a group of 4 friends including myself.  We already knew each other from school but we only got close when one of our friends (not included in the group so would be 5) suddenly passed away from dr*g ab**se. All of us have ADHD. I'll refer to them as A, B and C.

Needless to say we were that ""emo lost"" group for a long time. We bonded really close, specially after I got out of an abusive relationship. They were always extremely supportive to me and I'd trust them with my life. We went through so much together it would take a lifetime to list everything. I had a crush on A for a long time too.

Since the pandemic began we started falling away from each other. One by one we stopped sending daily messages and eventually we grew apart. 

Thing is I feel like I'm the only one that is actually upset with the group falling apart and trying my best to keep in contact with everyone. I'm the only one who tries to gather everyone together to play online or whatever. I'm the one who's been trying to gather us up together. It hurts to know that this group matters more to me than to  them now, giving all that we've been through.

I suppose that happens to every group of friendship, but I guess I never thought I'd feel ghosted by these friends ever in my life. Sometimes it takes weeks for them to reply me and to me that's not fair because I'm always available and constantly replying them, helping them and all.

When I lost my father, none of them showed up for the funeral or accompanied me during this harsh time. They simply sent a text message for condolences and felt like they've done their job. Is it too much to ask that they were a little more present when I was mourning the pass of my father? Giving the fact that everyone thought they'd loose their parents in pandemic, I'd imagine they'd be more empathic. Forgot to mention I had lost my aunt a couple months back too. 

I gave them as much space and time as they needed, but when I needed help and comforting I got none from them. My father's death will complete one year this week and even though I asked all of them for support, I feel that I only got it from B. Even after leaving the group chat, the only one who actually bothered to check on me was B. C sent a quick text and when I didn't reply she didn't care. A is completely out of the picture, she barely knows that I'm not ok.

 Long story short, they started laughing at me in Among Us and I got pretty upset with it. I was drunk, sad and lonely and cried for hell that day. I know they didn't mean that, but it hurt. As it's been hurting all along. So that's why I quit the group, and I'm pretty sure it's gonna die without me in it.

While I did happen to find it slightly odd that it was my sisters inviting me and not my own parents, I didn’t question it, as I understood that—what with Jeffrey’s medical issues and all—they may have been unable to find the time themselves to invite me.

Well, when I arrived at Elaine and Jeffrey’s house with Carolyn and Juliette, I was greeted by Angelica, who informed me that Elaine had been forced to step out of the house for a minute to grab something, but that I was “welcome to come inside”. When I did, though, Jeffrey started to commence a ruckus, claiming that he had “never invited me”, and that “Juliette and Carolyn are \[were\] unwelcome in his household”.

Despite my silent protests, Carolyn inquired as to why she and her daughter were so unwelcome, to which Jeffrey responded with, “well, neither of you aren’t related to me, anyways”, which was (biologically) true in the sense that Juliette was adopted and—of course—that forced Jeffrey to believe that he and Carolyn (and my daughter) were strangers (which he did not feel for Georgia’s husband and children, because—since her children were related to Jeffrey—he felt that he and her husband were related in an odd sense, may I add).

Then, Elaine walked through the door and—looking rather calm—asked me and my family to “please exit her household”, and—despite Carolyn grabbing Juliette’s carrier to walk out—I stepped in front of Elaine and told her that “just because you don’t feel ‘related’ to my wife and daughter doesn’t mean that you’re going to usher us out of your house like garbage”. I also managed to mention that Angelica and Georgia had invited me. This, of course, shocked the entirety of my family, but Carolyn stepped back in with Juliette and stood by my side, seemingly agreeing that we were not going to leave.

Well, we ended up staying the rest of Thanksgiving, despite my parents verbally wishing for us to leave (for the same aforementioned ‘biological’ reasons), due to our evident persistence to step out the door just because my wife and daughter didn’t “share the same biological properties” as them.

The next day (today), Carolyn mentioned to me that she had told our aforementioned story to some people at work, and that they had essentially called her \[us\] the asshole because we “didn’t step out when Elaine and Jeffrey made it blatantly clear that they didn’t want you all \[us\] crowding their meal”, and—now that I think about it—my wife’s friends weren’t necessarily incorrect.

So I, M24, have been friends with Adam, M25 since we were kids. Adam and I have had a fantastic friendship, and we consider each other like family. We both come from considerably wealthy families, and our families are also in business together, so we're both pretty close to each other's families.

Throughout our friendship, Adam hasn't really been the type to date, and he was also child-free because he said being a dad seemed kind of stressful. I, on the other hand, have always been the romantic type and have always wanted to be a dad.

Adam and I are also in a tight-knit friend group of people we've known all our life. We're all pretty close with each other, but I'm the closest with Adam.

Now, about a year ago, Adam went on a trip to Jamaica and while there, he met this girl named Alicia. Apparently, Adam and Alicia hit it off because since then they've been dating and Adam has been spending most of his time in Jamaica. He even bought a house for her parents and has been paying for her two siblings' schooling. Which I think is quite absurd since he doesn't even know if the relationship is gonna last.

Alicia is also a single mom and when Adam met her, she had a 2-month-old daughter who is now 1 year old which Adam has now considered his own, even his parents consider her as their granddaughter, and his whole family seems to consider Alicia as their daughter.

Recently, Adam came to me and told me that he was planning on proposing to Alicia and wanted my help planning it as a surprise for her. Now I was pretty shocked when I heard this and on the spur of the moment asked Adam I he was really planning on marrying that gold digger. Adam looked shocked when he hears that and asked me what I meant by that. And I told him that I think Alicia might be a gold digger trying to get into his pockets since he's been paying for all her families necessities and he's also taken on the father role of a kid that isn't his even though he previously said he didn't want kids.

When I said this Adam got quite angry and told me that if that's what I think of the woman he ""loves"" then I should stop contacting him and stay away from him and his family. This shocked me and I asked him if he was really gonna throw away years of friendship for some girl and her kid and he said yes. 

When I told all our other friends about this they got pretty and at me and said Adam was right to do what he did so now I'm wondering if I might be the asshole.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4824004,public,top,self,AITA For Calling My Best Friend's Girlfriend A Golddigger?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4go2a/aita_for_calling_my_best_friends_girlfriend_a/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,

AITA - Me (f51) &amp; my hubs (m53) have been married for a year &amp; dated for three years before tying the knot.  We are both divorced – I have a kid from my previous marriage (f15) who lives with us full time. Hubs has two kids (m20) &amp; (f25) &amp; they lived with their mother (Ex 42) after the divorce. 

The first Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas I spent with my now hubs at his mother’s house was when his dad was dying &amp; passed away in between Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas in 2018. The Ex was there for both Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas dinners.  

MIL continues to “feel sorry for” Ex bc she has no friends &amp; her family lives in a different state. Ex’s mother passed away a few months ago. MIL kept hinting she wanted to invite Ex to Thanksgiving. I finally said, “Look – if you want to invite her, Thanksgiving is at your house, if you don’t invite her, Thanksgiving is at our house.” So she invited Ex &amp; Thanksgiving was at MILs. Again, very awkward, but not my home so I don’t make the rules. 

MIL came over one night &amp; brought us dinner. Then she told us that MIL &amp; hubs’s daughter (f25) had decided that Christmas Eve we would all go out to dinner together &amp; that Ex &amp; ex’s father &amp; brother would come too &amp; that Christmas morning would be held at MILs &amp; that Ex &amp; Ex’s father &amp; brother would be there too. MIL then told me that I should be grateful that she looked out for me &amp; said Christmas night dinner would not include Ex &amp; her father &amp; brother.

My boyfriend has no issue with what I said but his mother is saying I’m an evil asshole. We’ve been together for two years and live together. His mom has never liked me because she thinks my boyfriend can do better than me (he’s told me this) and I’ve also overheard her saying similar things about me. He’s told me to not take it personal since she hated every girl he’s ever introduced her to. She’s very overprotective of him and wants the best for him since he’s adopted and her only child. 

My boyfriend has told me about how he has some issues with her because she did try to hide a lot about his adoption in regards to his biological parents wanting to be in an open adoption and her moving him away and having a huge savior complex. She does genuinely love him but she does too much. Anyways this happened a few days ago when my boyfriend and I stopped into town to spend time at his parents house. His dad is always really nice but his mom was being very rude to me. We ended up getting into an argument after I was baking cupcakes in the kitchen and she came in upset I was using the kitchen (my boyfriend told me I could) plus it was my utensils I used to make them and I cleaned up after me. She said it’s rude to not ask the homeowners if you can use their kitchen and that she feels uncomfortable. My boyfriend had taken his dogs on a walk so it was just me and her in the house.

I said sorry and that my boyfriend told me I could bake them and that we were making them for everyone. She said that she won’t be eating anything a stranger cooked in her house and I said I’m not a stranger. She said until I’m married to him I’m no one to him and that he could choose someone else anytime and our relationship means nothing. I told her she doesn’t own her son and that he’s free to do as he pleases and she laughed and said she’s his mom and she can tell who the right woman is for him and it’s not me. 

I said that just like you chose him to be your son, I chose him to be my boyfriend and there’s nothing you can do about it. She said that she’s a real mother to him and and to not disrespect her by comparing my relationship to theirs and I said my relationship is just as real as hers since she’s going off choices and technically we did choose each other and she chose him, he didn’t choose her. She got upset and started crying and my boyfriend came back and she tried twisting my words and told him that I said their relationship isn’t real because it’s not biological and that I’m an evil asshole and is trying to turn his aunts and cousins against me.

I (27f) have been working at a family-owned business for a little over a year now. A lot of the employees have been working there since the current owners' father was the boss. It's a very tight-knit group, and I do feel welcome. 

Towards the end of 2021, one of my bosses got engaged. He was very vocal about the wedding, but I wasn't really expecting to be invited. Yet I got an invitation anyway. All my coworkers are going. 

Normally I would go, but there are a few factors holding me back: 

1. It's on New Year's Eve, which I have typically spent with my friends and family. 
2. The attire is black-tie, and I don't own anything fancier than a dress from Kohls. 
3. The ceremony is less than an hour long, and I'd have to get a ride downtown and back for the ceremony. (I can't attend the reception for a variety of reasons, including anxiety and budgetary). 

I was originally just going to go to the ceremony, but now I'm not so sure. Traveling downtown and back (I live in the suburbs of a major city) is difficult, as I don't drive. But I don't want to seem ungrateful or as if I don't care about my boss and his fiance.

Months later she wants to reconcile. I explained that I don't think its a good idea, because she doesn't trust me (which I understand after everyting).

I(20enby) had decided to go with my bf to his families house for Thanksgiving. My mom didn't tell me anything the whole week about what she was going to do for the holiday, so I figured she was just gonna make some food and stay in. 
I admit when I left I only said 'I'll be back."" So I get to the house, and it was so nice. Everyone was friendly, and didn't mind our anti socialness. We played video games and had a few drinks, and overall I was enjoying myself. Around 6 pm my mom called and asked where I was. I told her, and she told me I need to pick what I was gonna do, and that I was using her house as a 'halfway house'. It's not the first time she said I was doing that. In fact in the last year she must have said it more that 10 times. 
I was getting anxious, I hate when she gets upset with me. I didn't want to leave so early, but I knew I had to. So my bf got one of his family members to drive us home. When I got back it was around 8. My mom, sister, her 3 kids and her husband were all in the living room. They didn't even stay for more than an hour, and when they left I stayed in my room for the rest of the night.
I get that I didn't tell her where I was going, but it feels like every time I try to be out of the house for a few days or for certain holidays I'm being compared to a couch hopper and some kid with no appreciation for my own family.

We have recently been in an argument about her house. 

I hate her house, there is so little to do, 70% of the time we either watch tik tok or do the deed. My house, I have a 50 inch tv in my room, a gaming pc, a pool, and a soccer net (yes i sound spoiled but i bought the pc and tv). At her house there is a 32 inch tv and a cat. Which leaves us to our phones, or getting it on. Honestly, I think it’s a waste of time. At my house we watch movies together and play with my dogs or play with my nieces. 

I go over once every weekend or every other weekend where as she comes over 1-3 times a week. This started when her step mom started saying I was a terrible bf because I never go to their house. My girlfriend has been nagging on me to go over but I also have been busy for holidays. The last three times she asked was when I had to clean for family coming into town for thanksgiving, my sister’s birthday, and when she was on her period (I didn’t want to go cause she was horny and yea). She says I need to make sacrifices, which i understand, but we’re still in high school and i’m not missing family things for her. I will admit in the past I told her no because I wanted to play games or the new cod and that was a smaller argument, but that typically is after we hung out the day before. 

I told her no yesterday because I wanted to watch the world cup game (USA VS ENGLAND) and play games. I don’t see a problem with it but all of her held in anger about it came out. I told her I hated her house and my house just has more to do and she came out and she started calling me an asshole that doesn’t care about our relationship.

He told me then that we would probably go in either the first or the second week of August, but that I should try to not plan anything in August. It was either skipping the vacation with my friends or only having two weeks available for their vacation. I planned my vacation with my friends at the end of August and it will be a week, still giving me space to go with his family. I already booked the vacation as I had been delaying booking with my friends and they really wanted to have it done.

Now suddenly, his family has booked the family vacation at the same time as my vacation with my friends. This is because the residence that they want is only available at that time.

My husband (H) and I have a 4-wheeler (4W) that’s our daughter’s.  The 4W is old and always has issues. My H got it out and let my nephews ride it around. He was out there with them the entire time. When my oldest nephew (N and he is 18) had his turn, he was riding it fast. But H never told him to tone it down or go easy on it, in fact I’ve seen H ride the 4W that hard before.  H did try to get N to stop twice to give the other nephews a second turn. N finally stopped but then the 4W wouldn’t start again. There may be an issue with the clutch, we don’t know yet. It definitely needs a new shut off valve (or something like that I don’t know engines) as that part was always bad. 

So this morning after looking at the 4W, my H comes inside and I ask him how it is and he angrily states “if I can’t fix it, your brother owes me a new 4W!” I said “wait a second, it’s always been broken and you were supervising the boys on it?  You never told N he was riding it too hard or to take it easy.”  H launches into some speech how that’s what men do if they break something and your brother has plenty of money so what’s the big deal? (I’d say we are on equal financial footing).  I held firm and finally said “if you tell my brother he has to buy you a new 4W, you’ll be making stuff weird in the family.”

I’ve met what she calls her “leather family” about five times now. About as frequently as I see some of my own chosen family and more frequently than I see my own family, tbh. 

She tells me that they saved her from unsafe BDSM situations and accept her for who she is. So it’s important I get along with them. They are like chosen family to her. I get that. But each time I hang out with them I get creepy vibes from them. Supposedly they are all queer and trans, but I feel myself explaining things about misogyny, consent, and power I shouldn’t have to explain. They are also all much much older than her (we are in our 20s and they are mostly in their 50s.) They all have sex with one another at kink parties. And get mad at me (and her) for me not going to these meet ups or parties. I’ve tried to politely say they aren’t my type. Then my girlfriend calls me “Princess” for having “too high of standards.” 

They also talk too much about blood, piercings, and violence for me to withstand time around them. I wish I wasn’t this sensitive. I’m trying not to be. But one just kept talking about the blood/pus issues he had after top surgery at the bar. My girlfriend mentioned at one get together that we will be trying to get married and get pregnant. At this get together, people in the leather family suggested that she use her ex (who is a cis guy in the leather family) to donate sperm. When I said no, I’m uncomfortable. They then offered the sperm of two other men in the leather family. I once again said I was uncomfortable. My girlfriend doesn’t see the problem. She thinks they are being helpful and I don’t accept her as she is. 

For context, I go to my girlfriends bio family house. I plan vacations with them and I try my best to get along with them. I am friends with her friends outside of this leather family, but lately she has isolated herself from all of those people. This all escalated when this holiday season I didn’t want to go to her leather families Thanksgiving. She isn’t talking to me right now. I feel like a terrible boyfriend.

I bit of backstory. About 5 months ago. I \[13M\] started liking one of my friends, which we will call Luke. Now Luke \[13M\] was straight which of course meant there was no point in telling him. In fact I chose not to tell anybody except my friend who I only talk to through social media. A month later I told a friend of mine that I did like a guy but he was straight. The next day her and 2 other friends of mine, who we will call Milly and Izzy, were begging me to tell them. So I did. And they thought I should tell him. So about a week later I did. Of course I got the ""I'm sorry, I don't think of you in that way"" friendzone shit. And that's all that ever really happened. I did make a couple of jokes about it every now and then but other than that we didn't speak of it.

Now a months after the holidays, the first week back, Luke and Izzy got together. Of course this was sudden and I may or may not have secretly cried. But I had to deal with it. Because that's how life works. They would get really close and hug all the time and sometimes kiss which of course made me uncomfortable, but I am in no position to be controlling what those 2 do.

Now fastforward a month to yesterday. Izzy and Milly were talking about something which I didn't care about because I was caught up in other stuff. About an hour later, Izzy says

""Fuck it, I'm just gonna tell him.""

""No Izzy don't,"" said Milly.

""Me and Luke made out last night.""

""Oh. Okay,"" I say.

Now I overheard them talking about something that sounded like her getting a hickey but I chose to ignore it because I'm too desperate to be hearing that.

We also decided to move into his original house in the aftermath of our wedding, as he, Hailey, and I had to fit into it.

My father (68M), Gregory, though, is unable to say the same. When we had him over for his birthday a few years ago, he showered Hailey with disrespect and pessimism, and even went as far as to tell me that she “didn’t deserve what she got.” That same year, Hailey was told that he had to “deal with something at home”, causing Gregory to leave early, though she was old enough to understand that he’d basically ‘kicked out’.

This year, though, my younger brother (39M), William, moved into my and Cameron’s house with us, as he was struggling financially and desperately needed something stable in his life until he could get back on his own two feet. 

Recently, though, William proposed inviting Gregory to Thanksgiving as he had been “looking forward to seeing him.” I told him that Hailey was also coming, though, and that Gregory had always made it clear that he was unable to treat Hailey like a ‘real person’, so Cameron and I had decided that he wouldn’t be allowed to visit us (if he asked).

William—who cares about Hailey and our family—agreed and said that he wouldn’t propose it to our father. And—as soon as I thanked him—it left my mind and I carried myself away with various other preparations.

A few days ago, though, Hailey had come to our house for a visit, which was the point that William decided to break it to the family that “Gregory’s coming for Thanksgiving!” Cameron, Hailey, and I were shocked, as we had never discussed such a possibility, but William went on, saying that he had been asking, causing him to decide to invite him.

Well, I told William that he was not coming and that he would have to call Gregory to tell him that he was not going to be allowed to come (which seemed especially fair to me as our father had apparently not even purchased a plane ticket prior to my brother’s reveal). Unfortunately, though, my brother refused, so I had to ring Gregory myself to tell him that he would most certainly not be coming due to how he had shown he was unable to treat his step-grand-daughter well.

William started to call me the asshole, saying that he had not been able to see Gregory for years due to his stretched financial conditions, and that I had likely just taken away his only chance to see our father, which (as I likely don’t have to mention) he has/had always loved dearly. This argument especially pained me, as my brother and I have always been rather close (well, for siblings, that is) and respectful of one another. Reactions like the one mentioned above are rather infrequent for the two of us.

About 5 months ago. I \[13M\] started liking one of my friends, which we will call L. Now L \[13M\]  was straight which of course meant there was no point in telling him. In fact I chose not to tell anybody except my friend who I only talk to through social media. A month later I told a friend of mine that I did like a guy but he was straight. The next day her and 2 other friends of mine, who we will call M and ***I*** (italic and bold) to avoid confusion with the pronoun), were begging me to tell them. So I did. And they thought I should tell him. So about a week later I did. Of course I got the ""I'm sorry, I don't think of you in that way"" friendzone shit. And that's all that ever really happened. I did make a couple of jokes about it every now and then but other than that we didn't speak of it.

Now a months after the holidays, the first week back, L and ***I*** got together. Of course this was sudden and I may or may not have secretly cried. But I had to deal with it. Because that's how life works. They would get really close and hug all the time and sometimes kiss which of course made me uncomfortable, but I am in no position to be controlling what those 2 do.

Now fastforward a month to yesterday. ***I*** and M were talking about something which I didn't care about because I was caught up in other stuff. About an hour later, ***I*** says

""Fuck it, I'm just gonna tell him.""

""No *I* don't,"" said M.

""Me and L made out last night.""

""Oh. Okay,"" I say.

Now I overheard them talking about something that sounded like her getting a hickey but I chose to ignore it because I'm too desperate to be hearing that. I was shocked, and then 3 minutes later I was just... sad. I could barely focus on our schoolwork and I kind of just sat there thinking about the 2 of them and holding back my tears. ***I*** and M would ask me if I'm okay but I would just respond with yeah.

It’s quite famous; vibe is high end ($$-$$$). You always have to reserve a table. 

While walking in, we saw that a table for 2 was empty near the windows. I asked our waitress, “sorry, would it be possible to seat us at that table for two near the windows?” She snapped, “yeah I already checked that but that table is reserved for 4. We’ll join the tables. You’ll be in the back.” I was surprised but didn’t think much of it. We follow her to our table— in the absolute back, the last table cramped up in a corner next to the coat rack and loo. We asked if there was any other table. She said “the bar is an option”. Since people usually only drink at the bar, having dinner there seemed awkward. We said it’s fine. Later we realized people were constantly opening the bathrooms. We asked another server nearby if we could move to the bar. She let us switch. 

Here’s where this gets weird. We saw that 2 more tables opened up within 5 min of us being seated at the bar. We asked our server again now that more tables were empty. She said she can’t do that as they’re reserved. I said I understand, but we also had a reservation for a table and they’re empty. From my understanding, you can’t reserve specific tables and no one else has arrived yet. She said if others don’t show up I’ll seat you there. She said all this while rolling her eyes and making faces. At the time I let it go. I just wanted to have a good meal with my partner. 

The bartender asked us what we wanted to drink and we politely told him sorry, we weren’t planning to drink tonight, just eat a meal. And we’re sorry we’re doing it at the bar. He was sweet and said it’s totally fine. He asked if we wanted a table. I said yes, told him about our original reservation. He asked if we told our server. I said yes,twice. Surprised to hear that,he said he’d look into it. He told his coworkers “hey can you check if they can get a table, they told their waitress a while ago I don’t know what she’s been doing”. She entertained other people who came in meanwhile, taking them to tables. Two more tables opened up. 30 min in, we’ve been denied a nice table, server hasn’t visited us once to ask about our order.

Since other servers got involved, she came to us at the bar, and in a weird hostile way told us “follow me”. Finally we got a nice table near a window, 45 min in,and 2-3 other tables for two were empty still. Our hostess changed, rest of the experience was good. 

I thought I was reading too much into the situation. Maybe she (a white woman) was not racist to two Indians in an Indian restaurant.

Now my first couple days I got to know most of my new teachers, besides one who was off for a couple days due to sickness and we had a sub. Now from what I've heard this teacher, we'll call him Mr. Jones, is a really good teacher so I was excited to have him compared to other teachers of the same subject. When I first started the new school I informed all the teachers that I was deaf, I don't really need an ASL translator because I can read lips like a boss and my teachers have since used lesson plans that I'm able to follow along with by the instructions on the board and if I don't understand then they pay me a bit more attention in class so that way I don't fall behind which I appreciate. All of this changed when Mr. Jones got back though. Class seemed to be going fine until we got to doing a practical exercise, which I didn't really understand the instructions that he had given because he spoke to fast for me to lip read him and the instructions weren't on the board so I was completely lost. I asked him to repeat the instructions a couple times but that still didn't help, which I eventually got help from another student sitting next to me. After class he held me back for a few minutes to chat with me and ask why I as a new student was giving him a hard time. I told him that I wasn't giving him a hard time I just didn't understand the instructions and needed them repeated because I was deaf. He told me that he couldn't repeat the same instructions multiple times when they were fairly straightforward. He then told me that I wasn't deaf because I don't look deaf and I responded kinda shocked to hear that come from a teachers mouth. I asked him what a deaf person looked like and he responded that I didn't have a hearing aide or a cochlear implant. I responded that they wouldn't do me any good as I was completely deaf, why spend money on something that wouldn't be useful to me. He then told me that if I was completely deaf then I shouldn't be able to be talking with him right now and that if I was really deaf I should be put into a class with kids with disabilities.

This left my roommate in the top bunk when she arrived a month later, which is a little smaller but has the benefit of being next to lots of space to store things.

My roommate suggested about 2 weeks ago that maybe at the start of December, we could consider swapping bunks? I initially agreed, largely to keep the peace, but I've had concerns since I said okay. For one, I would be clearing my entire bunk, moving everything up top, for about 10 days before needing to clear everything and bring it down again. Additionally I do still worry about how I'll manage the ladder, and it will undoubtedly be easier to pack my suitcase with the bottom bunk to gather things instead of the floor.

I accept she has perfectly good reasons for wanting to swap - the bed is bigger, it's simpler to get into without a ladder, and I did get my first choice before she arrived. I just have concerns that for 10 days it's really not worth the faff on both sides. She'll have to move things out of her bunk too, and we'd both be swapping the bedding.

So WIBTA for telling her I would prefer not to swap bunks? It seems a simple situation but I've got a nagging feeling it'd be quite rude of me.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4823868,public,top,self,WIBTA if I ask not to swap bunks with my roommate?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4f16u/wibta_if_i_ask_not_to_swap_bunks_with_my_roommate/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,

My brother and his wife hosted. I am vegan (and lactose intolerant). My brother hosts most family get togethers because it's tough for them to get out of the house with three young kids. I always ask in advance if I can bring anything, but am always told no, with the exception of my faux turkey and gravy that I brought last night. Well, that's what I had to eat last night, plus cranberry sauce, and I ate a dinner roll, which honestly I'm not sure was even vegan. They put cheese on the roasted carrots, Brussel sprouts, and salad. The regular and sweet potatoes both had dairy. Honestly I was pretty bummed. This has been an increasing trend for them to have few to no options for me, it's gotten worse over time, and last night was the least they've offered me to eat. I really hesitate to say anything though. I don't want to be that vegan. I just want to be able to eat. I'd be happy to bring my own stuff (to share, if desired) but I am always told that I don't need to. I just feel hurt that my brother puts me in this situation. I can't tell if it's a test or sibling rivalry or what. I do feel like he's been less accommodating since he got into hunting a couple years ago. He also feels the need to comment about killing deer and whatnot whenever the opportunity arises. I never say anything back, I just don't engage. 

So WIBTA if I said something about the food situation? I don't want to come across as entitled. I know he doesn't have to cook me anything special. But would putting a few carrots, sprouts, and salad aside last night before they got topped with cheese have been too much to ask? Or letting me bring my own food?

I'll call him Jack. My boyfriend's friends consists of 2 girls (I'll call them Amy and Julia) and 5 guys. They had also joined because of their boyfriends. I was shy and had a hard time getting to know them - though the guys pushed for 'the girlfriends' to get along. 
1 year later and now I go to college with Amy, Julia and Amy's boyfriend. Everyone else has moved to different colleges though we stay in touch often.

It's Jack's birthday soon so he had planned 2 events, dinner on a friday night and cinema on a sunday night. On the groupchat, Julia asks if we can eat somewhere else. Amy chimes in and says says the same. Everyone else in the group politely disagrees, asking why we should change a perfectly fine plan. (everyone can get to where we had chosen, and it was Jack's choice as its his birthday). Julia's response: it's shit food. 

Julia's boyfriend (Nathan) tells her good food doesn't matter, we're going to see Jack for his birthday. Amy and Julia proceed to say they aren't even able to go anyway because they are working (they already knew this). So they've been complaining about shit food and trying to change plans for something they can't even go to! 

I'm sat next to Jack as we read the chat. He shows me the groupchat he has with just the guys, where Nathan says he's arguing with Julia. Julia tells him to f off, and that the girl's opinions are never considered for an event she's not even going to. I ask if they can make it for the sunday instead. Amy says she has work then too (fair). Julia says she can't because she has a work meeting at 10:30am. Her boyfriend tells her to come afterwards. Her response: why? She clearly didn't want to come to see us for Jack's birthday. I had been anticipating seeing everyone for a while and Julia's complaints and rude comments upset me and Jack. 

On the guys chat, Nathan asks me for my opinion. Jack holds the phone to my mouth and records a voice note. I lose my temper, saying that their excuses were ridiculous and that I don't want friends that act that way. Jack and Nathan agree with me  (calling them childish etc). 

However.... we forgot that Amy's boyfriend was on the guys groupchat too (he never talks on it). He was at college with Amy and Julia at the time. He showed the messages to the girls. Amy texts me and says she's heard what I said and that I had made both Amy and Julia cry. She proceeds to say I should have said it to them directly, that I've always sided with the guys, etc. I apologised for what I said, and now since then Julia has ignored me. Their excuse for complaining was that they were 'just making suggestions for us' and that we overreacted. 

I have always criticised the kind of 'pick me' girls that only hang out with guys, and now I don't know if that's what I've become, or if these girls in particular are just not the people I want to be close with.

Since our daughter’s been born, she’s become… let’s say more militant… about feminism and women’s rights than she has in the past. I 100% support her in her endeavors but sometimes it can be a bit, especially when she makes snide comments about men whenever my friends are over. 

Yesterday, during Thanksgiving dinner with her family (who, let me say are extraordinarily conservative and were against us being together as we’re an interracial couple), her dad and I were discussing politics and, while I don’t agree with everything that he thinks about our nation’s polity, he made some interesting points that I thought were more in line with my/our views. The gloves came off, my fellow potential a-holes. 

Let me just say, I am of the opinion that even if you’re right about something, you can be wrong about how you come off to others about it. And if you can’t be nice when you speak, then don’t speak at all. It’s just the way I was raised. 

I don’t strictly disagree with what she said, but in the back and forth banter of it all, she said, verbatim “Oh that’s right, I forgot, you’re always right about everything.” Read all the sarcasm that there is folks. Now, my wife and I have an agreement about presenting a united front, particularly in front of her folks, because they’re the sort of people that will use any conversation had with them as ammunition against you in a later conversation. So I was very taken aback by that statement as 1) I’m not passive, but I’m sure as heck not the person that has to be right all the time and 2) shock factor that we’re going to have to deal with her folks about that statement later at some point.  

I admit, my response my be a-hole worthy. I calmly said back to her “Babe, you can be right about whatever it is we’re talking about and not be a smartass about it in front of your family.” 

Long story short, she’s not talking to me at the moment. I don’t feel guilt per she except that maybe I threw more fuel on the flame with her family, but what do you guys think.

One is the house I currently live in with my partner that we own together and our 2 daughters who are 10 and 2. The other house is my childhood home which I own myself which I inherited when my mom died in 2015. My mom’s house was fully paid off not long before her passing so I own it outright whereas my living house is mortgaged.

We lived in the house with my mom nursing’s her during her illness until her passing and stayed there for several years after as then, we just had one kid. The house was crowded before with my mom so When our second came along, we realised the house wasn’t big enough for us anymore. We had some savings and I received some money when my mom passed so we used that to buy a bigger house we love.

My problem is I cannot bear to touch my mom’s house. I lived there for most of my life, 28 years and it holds a lot of sentimental value to me. I do not want to rent it out or even sell it right now. I don’t even know if I’ll keep it for my daughters or sell it and give them the proceeds to help even though I’ve got funds set up for them. My point is: the house means a lot to me so right now it’s sitting empty in my possession.

A friend, Cassie is pressuring me to rent my house to her at a discounted rate or sell to her at below market value. She cannot afford her $2500 rent a month anymore due to her partner losing his job and her hours being cut. She is struggling to find another job as is he in the city and an affordable place for their flails of 4 including 2 kids. They have some savings and with their family’s help could apply for a mortgage but it’s nowhere near the amount needed for NYC house prices. I think she said they can qualify for 450k whereas the average starting price around her is 650k. She wants to still live in Brooklyn for their kids to be able to go to school otherwise she says she’ll have to find another job out of the city and uproot their whole lives.

I feel for her I really do but I do not want to be a landlord or sell. I told her I was sorry but no and that I sympathise as NYC prices are crazy but that my house isn’t up for negotiation.
