So I got engaged about a year ago and this past weekend I had my bachelorette party.

I invited a group of 8 other girls (not including myself) onto the trip and we were all so excited. Out of these 8 girls, three of them are single, one is married, two were engaged before me and two were engaged after.

So from my POV, it's my special weekend and the only time that me and my girls will celebrate ME being engaged and about to be married. So because of this, I politely asked the four girls who were engaged to not wear their rings just for the trip because I didn't want it to be confusing for anyone who the bride is. I was very polite in my message to each of them, that I've copied below in case anyone wants to see what I said:

&gt;Hey, \_\_\_\_\_! I'm so excited to celebrate with you this weekend. I did want to ask you a favor though! I know you and a few other girls are engaged, which I am SO excited about and ready to celebrate when the time comes, but just for this weekend I feel as though having multiple engaged girls takes away from my vision of the weekend. So I wanted to ask- would you mind leaving behind your ring just for the weekend? I PROMISE I wouldn't ask something so much of you if it wasn't that important to me, it would be so appreciated! &lt;3

Three of the girls didn't respond, but here is the one response

&gt;Hey girl! I will be bringing my engagement ring on the trip with me but I would be more than happy to take it off for pictures and such if you want to show off just your gorgeous ring! I just feel uncomfy not wearing it when we go out (especially to the club) but if there's a safe in the airbnb or something I could potentially leave it behind for some of the activities

Anyways I just hoped the other three's lack of response meant that they would respect my wishes but to my total disregard ALL FOUR OF THEM SHOWED UP WEARING THEIR RINGS.

I just wanted to have a fun weekend so I didn't address it, but the second night I was really hurt that they were all wearing their rings for all the activities we were doing so at night I went into their rooms and found their rings and just put them in my suitcase. My intention was to just have them there for the weekend.

the next morning all four of them confront me and even the single girl and married girl were kind of taking their side. They were freaking out asking me what I did with their rings and asked me if I was crazy and to give them back. It turned into a huge fight where they weren't listening to my reasonings and just yelling at me telling me that I have no right to expect them not to wear their rings. I told them to F off and thanks for ruining my bachelorette, went and grabbed their rings and threw it at them and then grabbed all my stuff called an uber to a motel and just stayed there until my flight the next day.

I've been crying non stop and got bombarded with lots of nasty texts implying i'm being an AH.

My mom is great and supportive- but her sister ( my aunt) and my extended family I don’t feel comfortable. 

In the past couple of years I had a series of bad events ( lost a good job, lost a relationship, a family death and I broke my ankle) all in a very short time. I fell into a very dark hole and was very heavily drinking therefore not taking care of myself and to be honest not really caring about being alive. I got help- my dads side of the family helped make arrangements and after months of therapy I’ve gotten mostly back on my feet. I’m taking care of myself, have a great job, and looking at finding better housing arrangements.  My mom is close to her sister- and told her about my personal struggles in confidence. It turns out she ran her mouth to the rest of my extended family that my hygiene was horrible and all in all sharing information that was not hers to share.  So I sent her a very blunt text- my story and struggles were not hers to share- that she has now caused even more shame than necessary ( there’s a lot of shame to deal with when healing from substance abuse) and that she hurt my mom and she hurt me.  I haven’t heard anything back but I did block her and my extended family on social media. 
I firmly believe my struggles are my story to tell- and not hers without permission. I just feel like I could possibly be TA for causing more conflict .

honor the policy our ex-employee failed to honor and cancel the venue citing this staffing error.

Or take on all the responsibility that our ex-employee was going to even though our team would have never approved it as a joint effort.

My mom was, at first, “happy” about it, but things changed when she realized that I would like to take care of my own self and my relationship rather than calling her EVERYDAY. She started to show signs of disapproval and kept getting reasons to tell me to break up with him for no sensible reasons at all.

Mom was not happy about this, and constantly nagging me/blaming me for being ungrateful to her (since she’s still supporting me financially for my uni).

So my mom contacted me just a few hours before my shift, and started showing her sulky behaviours as she criticized me on how “distant” I was recently due to me not calling anyone at home much. I calmly explained to her that I was busy with both my uni and my work. She calmed down a bit, then started asking me about my progress on getting a nail certification. I told her that I was arranging and balancing my schedule to go for training, and I do have a plan that I deemed to be fit. As soon as I let her know about this, she went on a full rampage, saying that I’m just a lazy, ungrateful sh!t, that I don’t train as intense as she wants me to is because of dating my bf, and that I should have break up with him sooner. I tried to explain that I would try to spend as much time to train as possible and I’m, indeed, busy with other things aside from dating my bf. She didn’t listen to my explanation, got sidetracked, and decided to throw a tantrum about how ungrateful I am for not contacting anyone from my family while still asking for financial support. She started to compare me with my younger brother in Singapore, saying that even when he got full scholarship for a junior/high-school program (he’s 6 yrs younger than me FYI), he would still contact my fam EVERYDAY, and that I can’t do “this basic thing for them”. When she realized that I was speechless with her tantrum, she gave me the silent treatment, ultimately decided that she “didn’t want to do anything with me anymore”.

But we’ve been in agreement that school comes first and job I should an extra. She doesn’t live with me but we have a very good bond.

This week, she called me upset. She was given notice at her job. She was sacked. She said it’s  not fair, she’s only called in sickness a few times when she was hangover or had an assignment due. I completely agree with the pattern, assignments come first. 
She was really upset and said it wasn’t fair and they didn’t like her that’s probably why they fired her because they always told her of friends for mistakes.

I took it upon herself to help her out and called the company. I told them how disappointed I was in them and that they had to understand that school comes first and they couldn’t expect her to come in when she’s has assignments. I tried to be reasonable and explain it to them but they wouldn’t listen. They told me they only hire students and schedule them around their lectures and are reasonable to work with when people have assignments but calling in a night before a morning shift is a way to go. I argued with them that it’s not reasonable and that they must understand that school comes first and they can’t just fire her.

But the manager told me she didn’t have to speak to me and to quit calling. This was incredibly disrespectful. I called the next day to try and get the franchise owner on the phone but I got another manager who was just as disrespectful if not worse than the first one. What’s worse, I hear other employee laughing in the background and making fun of th fact that Jane’s mummy is calling and wondering if Jane lost a blanky.

Appallingly, the manager didn’t tell them off. This made me incredibly upset and I wrote to the HQ and left scathing reviews everywhere I could as well as tweeting kfc. I haven’t heard anything since.

My daughter found out about this and is fuming. She thinks I am babying her and now, she wouldn’t want to come back because everyone would make fun of her. She’s really upset because the manager called her and told her to tell her mommy to stop calling them.

I (33f) have known R (36f) for almost 14 years after we met in the military. She’s been married to J(30m) for over 11 years, but it hasn’t been all rainbows and butterflies. They’ve both cheated on each other numerous times over the years, but somehow always work it out for their sake and for their kids. 

Always, R and I have been drifting apart from each other recently (it happens I know) and the only time she talks to me is when she wants to bitch about J and always thinks he’s cheating. Keep in mind he gave her his location on his phone all the time, let’s her go through his phone and stuff, etc. So there’s no evidence of this. 

One day R asks me to look up a number that popped up on J’s watch and it was a text now number. R asked me to message it to see who it was so I did. No response. R continues to say she has a feeling that he’s doing something while he’s golfing or something so that gave me the idea. I got a new text now number, texted J and said I had fun golfing with him. He asked who I was and I kinda of leered him in to see if I could get anything out of him. I obviously didn’t so I left it like that, not telling R anything I did. 

R became super paranoid someone was stalking her and J so asked text now app who sent the texts. Well, apparently the app told her it was someone from my location and I’m the only know she knows from that city. Now she’s all mad at me for getting involved in her marriage and that what I did is, “fucked up.” I haven’t texted her back after she found out and freak led and don’t know what to say to her.

My (f22) younger brother (m19) does athletics training once a week that starts at 7pm. He’s quite good and our family and his club think he has a real future in the sport. For context, he does nothing for the rest of the week, he doesn’t work or go to college, this is his only weekly commitment. Our parents have offered to pay for his driving lessons but he’s shown no interest in learning to drive. When he did work 30 minutes away my mum and I took turns chauffeuring him to and from work.

Today, England and Wales are playing in the World Cup group stages to get through to the round of 16, the match starts at 7… 

As usual my mum asked me to drive him to training because she can’t see to drive at night. I agreed and said I’ll take him a bit earlier than usual so I don’t miss the start of the game. I messaged him at 5pm telling him I’d be dropping him off at training earlier that usual because I wanted to watch the match, he was dismissive saying “it’s only a group stage match and I’m not even a real football fan.” 

At around 6:15 when I was feeding my pets I realised I hadn’t told him we’d be leaving at 6:40 I so went to his room and told him (he’d already showered so just had to get dressed). He complained but agreed. I chose 6:40 as it would be approximately a 20 minute round trip. 

At 6:35 I went up to my room and changed so I was ready to bring him to training, he came up at 6:38 saying he needed to do a number 2. I warned him that if he wasn’t ready he’d be walking to training. 

At 6:42 I went outside to turn my car around as he still wasn’t ready. I sat in my car until 6:48 before I came back inside and watched the players walk out etc. He then sauntered into the living room saying he was ready to go. I told him I would not be taking him as I’d warned him if he was late he’d be walking. He then started shouting at me saying I’m “messing with his future” and “we’re done don’t ask me for anything” for around a minute before storming out of the house. 

My mum was sat in the sofa watching the entire exchange and said nothing. When I tried to talk to her about it she said I’m making her head hurt but then a few minutes later said I should’ve taken him…

I (m) had a crush on my close friend Joe  for like two years, but never told him because I didn't want to loose him as my best friend. I introduced Joe to my friendgroup around a year ago, they all immediately clicked and I thought that nothing could go wrong and was really happy.
But then, a few weeks later, one of my friends, Lisa, started to develope feelings for Joe after they made out while being drunk. She apologized to me so many times, because she knew about my feelings for him. Or course I wasn't mad on her, like, you can't control your feelings. We talked about the whole situation and she promised me that she would never date him, since I'm way more important to her and she didn't want to hurt my feelings.
Just to clarify: I would never have forbidden her from dating Joe or being in a relationship with him. I've been in a very similar situation before and these two people ended up dating. Although I was a bit hurt, of course, I was happy for them both.
I told Lisa that too, but she said she would never do that. She even offered me to break up contact with him (which I didn't want). 
A few weeks later I had a interesting conversation with Joe, where he told me, that he and Lisa started  dating  (she didn't tell me). He also showed me one of their chats, where Lisa told him that I wanted to forbid them to meet each other (which I never did!) and some other things I never said. Joe was irritated and asked me why I would do something like that, I explained him the whole situation and he believed me but let me know that they would still continue dating.

I tried to talk to Lisa about it and asked her, why she lied to me. And suddenly her opinion on this situation was the complete opposite. She told me that it's none of my business, I should stop being so sensitive and dramatic and that I was a bad friend.
While I was pissed/hurt because she lied to me the whole time, she acted like I was just being a little, jealous kid.

She said that I was an asshole for not letting her be happy and that it was unfair of me to make her feel bad (being mad) for being with this guy.

Fast forward about 6 months and I've started dating a new partner. She had insecurities around me being friends with my ex, due to previous relationship trauma - she was cheated on by a previous boyfriend. She was always on guard for evidence I was going to do the same. This didn't feel like an issue to me, since Ex and I we were strictly platonic.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, one of the cats started to get really sick. He used to be my Ex's before we dated, so I was giving her updates all the time. He was in and out of the vet, sneezing blood all over the place. I had him on four different medications, administered at three different intervals a day. I was extremely stressed out about it. After about two months of this, we were approaching a two week trip with my new GF we had planned for a while. I had hoped the cat situation would have resolved in time, but he was only getting worse. My mom lived with me, but I didn't want to rely on her to take care of this dying cat at all hours of the day, so I called up my ex and decided to coordinate a day for her to come to town and we could put the cat down together. 

&amp;#x200B;

My new GF's birthday was also coming up, we had plans to spend the day together. The way it worked out, the only time that would really work for everyone to put the cat down was the day after her birthday. I figured Ex can go over to my house, spend time with her dying cat and my mom. I'll spend the day with my GF, have a nice bday and go home and put down my cat, a week later we'd fly out on our trip. So I called my ex, told her the plan, everything was going to work out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I told my GF the plan. She immediately got very upset with me, told me I ""invited my ex to sleep over on her birthday"" without asking her first, cancelled our plans, decided I didn't get to celebrate her birthday with her. We'd still hang out, but it ""wasn't her birthday"". I wasn't allowed to take her out, I wasn't allowed to give her presents, she decided her birthday was ruined. She saw it as an act of infidelity, and strongly implied through her language that I was sleeping with my ex. She demanded to come watch the cat be put down, but my Ex said that would make her really uncomfortable, and I kinda agreed, so I prioritized her comfort since it was her cat.

&amp;#x200B;

We fought about it, eventually the day came, I went over to my GF's apartment, we argued all night, didn't celebrate, I went home in the morning. My ex and I put down the cat in the sunny front yard of my house, it was a really sad and beautiful. We took the dog to the park, she stayed another day, slept on the couch, went back home to her town. My GF never called, didn't want to talk about my feelings, didn't care about my cat at all. We still went on our trip, but it put a huge rift between us.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months and he has a birthday coming up next month. He and I have talked about gifts for him briefly in passing. About a month ago he and I were out to dinner and on our way back to the car his sandal ripped apart. I know these are his go-to shoes and he would need a new pair but isn't impulsive enough to replace what was broken on the spot.

Fast forward to today - he still does not have the sandals and it is cyber deal week. I mentioned to him as I walked out of the house this morning that I wanted to start looking for a birthday gift for him. When I got to work I told him I was looking online for deals during cyber week and asked him to send me ideas of what he wanted.

The first link I sent him was of the sandals I knew he wanted/needed and asked him what size and style he preferred. He took it upon himself to dive deeper into looking for a pair and found the exact ones he wanted on amazon.

We were going back and forth on a few styles and I said I wanted to get them while they were on sale and he said he would pay full price for the style he wanted. He then told me he was going to order them on amazon because there were only two left. I told (based on the link he sent me) even though it was on amazon and not on the sale that it fell within budget for me and I would be happy to get them.

Since he wanted to place the order ASAP with other things in his cart he told me I could still get them for him as a gift and just pay for them. I decided not to be overly pushy about it because he wasn't grasping the fact that this was the gift I wanted to get for him because of the sentiment behind it.

He then started sending me links for things he did not need but said I could get him and I became frustrated. I told him there wasn't anything else I had in mind that I wanted to get him for his birthday to set expectations.

After an hour or so went by he said that he could cancel his order so I could get him the sandals if it means that much to me, so that is what I did. However it left a sour taste in my mouth over the whole back and forth and I wish he would have just cooperated by letting me get the shoes in the first place.

We only saw them once or twice per year when I was growing up, but they were always “Uncle Mike and Aunt Leanne.” Because of this, I had sort of a built-in best friend as a child, their daughter, Monica (28F). We were always close despite the distance. 

My mom and Leanne both have strong, controlling personalities. Because of this, a few times in the past, they have broken contact. Recently, this happened again, as Leanne has decided that my mom is “toxic” for her, and that she needs some space. I think this ultimately is fair (although sad), as everyone is entitled to choose who they spend time with. 

Although it typically wouldn’t have anything to do with me, the tension leading to this had been building for some time. My single mom moved in 2020 (with Leanne’s encouragement) partly to be closer to them. Since she moved, though, it feels like we are only ever invited over for holidays involving gifts. For example, Leanne asked my mom to contribute $300 on a birthday gift for *her* husband. She also asked me to contribute $200 on a graduation gift for Monica’s long-term boyfriend. When we asked Leanne what we could get Monica for her birthday this year, the response was two pricey pairs of shoes (over $100 each).

The day after Monica’s birthday this year, we all planned to go on a weekend cabin trip together. I took off work partly because I was excited to see Monica, as I live in a different city and don’t get to see her very often. When she arrived, we were excited for her to open her gifts, but she shrugged them off and said she would open them later. I soon learned that she would be leaving halfway through our trip to travel and go to a concert with her boyfriend. This generally wouldn’t be an issue, but it follows many canceled plans (e.g., *my* birthday) and her blowing me off when given the chance for friends she sees much more often. Obviously, people naturally grow apart, but she has always called me the “low maintenance” friend. And I’m sort of tired of being that.

We always do big Christmases with them, I spend lots of time finding the perfect gifts for Monica, her sister, her parents, her boyfriend. But my mom and I always seem to get discount/outlet mall gifts, and play second fiddle to other, more fashionable guests (although they do always invite us at holidays - which is nice, because otherwise it is just the two of us). 

The cost of gifts is generally unimportant, but they each drive a BMW (one for each) and seem to expect nice gifts from us. I don’t think Monica is truly aware of how this comes off, as she’s a genuinely kind person, only rather self-centered and insulated.

The curtains are drawn &amp; no lights are on. It's pretty dark. I asked him, &amp; most recently, Jackson (when he came &amp; stayed with us for Thanksgiving break) who this person is.

Also, any damage that may be caused by this person will be the responsibility of the people living there.

All my life, I always wondered why I looked different. I've had people call me ugly and look at me weirdly. I've had people pointing out my facial asymmetry. I could ignore all of that, but lately, I just can't. 

I looked up possible reasons why I look this way and found out about plagiocephaly. I found out that I was supposed to have been given a helmet to wear as a baby to correct my head. So I decided to confront my parents as to why they didn't bring me to the doctor (at this point I wasn't angry at them. Yes I was frustrated with the way I looked but not at my parents). My parents simply laughed at me and shrugged it off. What set me off was when my father jokingly said that it was my fault since I used to like sleeping on the right side of my face as a baby (which assumably caused my plagiocephaly). While trying my best to keep my composure, I asked them again and made them answer me seriously. They said that they didn't bring me to a doctor as they didn't think anything was wrong.

I just exploded. All my life I had confidence issues because of the way I looked but my parents just can't take it seriously.

On to the problem, my BIL invited me and I couldn’t not go but I knew she wouldn’t like it. She also proposed a speech and in the second part I noticed it started getting really familiar. She had copied almost my entire speech. Half of the people there was my family and they realized what it was while the other half was confused. 

The difference about my husband and his brother is that my husband likes to be funny and play jokes while BIL is serious and finds humor annoying so what she said came as a shock to everyone. People started whispering about her and by that time everyone knew it was fake.

The only thing people posted and talked about after that was how she used someone else’s speech and how she horrible she was to not find true words to describe him. She texted me afterwards because mothers were so angry they had to cancel their honeymoon. She said I was such a AH for running her wedding like that’s but it wasn’t even my fault.

!Not My Story! 

My daughter is a 14 yr old. She used to be the nicest person ever and has never had ANY sort of behaviour troubles. We recently got a black Labrador (4 months) who adores her. 
She has been struggling in school and her teacher gave her some notes and hints on how to solve her math equations. The lab got a hold of her notes (HER NOTES WERE ON THE FLOOR) and chewed them up. 

She came home from school bawling her eyes out and said that she needs her notes so solve one Robles because her teacher told her if she doesn’t get 100/100 due to her horrible test scores than she will not move on to the next year/class. She came into her room to find her notes all crumpled up, soaking with spit and all over the place in pieces. She grabbed the dog and started strangling him. Making him whimper I ran up the stairs and pushed her away. I told her that she needed to stay at her grandmothers.

It was only brought up by my mom because my aunt and uncle are coming to visit her this week. 

Back in 2013, I had lost my job and had to move back in home with my parents. Definitely a pretty low time of my life. I got a temp job working in a warehouse as a picker and my shift started at 4 AM, so this meant I had to be awake at 3 AM. At this point, I had been back home for a month or so.

One night, about 10-11 PM , my mom and my aunt were having a Skype conversation in the computer room right outside the spare bedroom that I was staying in. The conversation was very loud, and I made a few attempts to kindly ask them to turn the conversation down, or take it to another room. They refused. My mom said “well I live here, so I’ll be on Skype as long as I want“. 
My aunt, then chimed in “well, if you don’t like it, you should move out.“ She said this, with a big grin on her face and began laughing at me. 

Having my mom and aunt say that to me, really hurt. At that point, being so tired and aggravated, my anger got the best of me, and I told my aunt to fuck off, gave her the finger, and unplugged the computer. Me and my mom argued for a little bit but I finally got some sleep. Me and my mom sat down after work and apologized. 

Now, 11 years later, I find out that my aunt has been holding a grudge against me this whole time. I am more than willing to apologize, but my aunt says she was not being inconsiderate towards me in any way and doesn’t want to apologize for her part.

I think I might be TA because what I said was disrespectful and out of anger. And it was vulgar and mean.

I personally thought it was a hilarious gift and also useful, but goodness gracious the look on her face when she opened it was pure unadulterated anger... I don't know if she found it offensive or was expecting me to get her something more expensive, or jewelry or what. But SHE WAS PISSED. She was yelling at me like "" SERIOUSLY IS THIS ALL IM WORTH TO YOU, A PEEQUALITY?!?!"" and I tried to calm her down like babe its not just a joke you can use it when we go camping, but she wasnt having it, I think she thought I was making fun of her by buying it for her, and I mean I kind of was but in a playful way. I don't know how to fix this lol, guess i gotta go buy her some earrings or something now, cause she has barely even looked at me since last night, and hasn't said a word, on top of that she got me a new Macbook for our anniversary so I feel like she completely outdid me and I was not expecting something so expensive, we normally dont splurge on gifts for each other....

We were always very close together, we always did something, we also played a lot at the time of classes, and we always had talk to each other. Our level of intimacy was also very great, I had a lot of freedom to talk to her as much as I want, and she also to me. But I can’t tell, but she also had a lot of anger inside her. Maybe school stress. And also your mother who wouldn’t let her leave the house for nothing. 
I found out she didn’t care about me when she didn’t even greet me. And that was just me, because after I was discarded, she’s my other friend and they started to get a lot closer. I say much closer. It got to a point where she did everything that was with me, with my other friend. I arrived in the room, and no words were exchanged much less a look. My friend arrived, in a matter of 5 minutes she was already laughing. 
I mean, the school that used to be a place for me to socialize and forget about my stress at home a little bit became hell. I can’t even talk to my friends, I feel uncomfortable socializing with one righteous person to another who is on your side, nor look at me. 
Sometimes she looks at me, talks to me, but the basics of everyday life. How: ""Will you go to such a place?"" ""You can get the snack for me"", ""the xxx is with her headset"", and when she lends me materials, it was not me who asked, but my other friend. She doesn’t sit next to me either, and I don’t know if she even misses sitting either. 
I can’t understand her, it would be okay if at least she told me she doesn’t want my friendship anymore. She talked to our friend who is part of our group, and this friend of ours told me that in the conversation, she said it would be better not to talk to me because it could get worse, she would get angrier. So after all that, I still wonder: Next year, she would really ignore my whole existence, and she would keep talking to all my friends, but would still continue to hate me?
This began to be a headache, missing around 1 week for teachers close the note, and I will be able to miss. But I wanted to enjoy laughing, clowning until then, but with my friends.

I barely post on reddit but I am so angry and need to know if I am just overreacting. 

So, recently I got a good friend of mine a job at a shop I work at in the mall. 
I thought she was a nice woman and cared a lot about her. I knew she was struggling so I talked with all my bosses (shop keeper and upper bosses) if they could hire her and recommending her to them. 
I did it, she got the job and didn’t even have to make a CV or apply for it online. 

It’s been almost a month since she works with me and everyone just hates her because she doesn’t like to work and always finds excuses to go earlier. 
I was already sad by that because I tried so hard to get her in and everyone seemed disappointed because they expected someone who really cared and hardworking. I take my work seriously and thought she would put a little more effort into it… 
This same friend, I thought I could trust. Last week I found out I am on my third week of pregnancy. I am very happy and told her about it. I told her that I will wait until I am 12 weeks pregnant to tell anyone at work. 
I tell her a lot about my private life since we has been hanging out for months now… 
Well, on Friday and Saturday I had my days off. Surprisingly I get back on monday and a coworker asked me if I was really pregnant. I told her i wasn’t but she kept saying that my friend has been telling everyone at work… 
I was so angry. I ignored it though and talk normally with her today, asking why she did that, she just said “well we work together, it’s normal everyone will know what happens in your privacy “ 
I let her be but after work I exploded after I went to get bread at the bakery in our mall and even the workers there knew about my pregnancy! 
I want to say many bad things to my friend or even stop being friends with her. Her attitude is making me sick…

He insisted that “no he would not give me keys” said “let this be a lesson to you” and “I’m not giving you anything you can learn”. Also said he was maybe coming home earlier if he felt sick (he had a cold last week). He then stormed off and practically ran to the train platform so he didn’t have to walk with me.  

I tore him a new one over text and told him how he was an asshole and how inappropriate it was to talk to his wife or a woman that way. He proceeded to tell me that “I acted this way during my first pregnancy” (I’m pregnant now) and that “I need to see a therapist to deal with my emotions” 

Also said “ I’m sorry you mistook me wanting the keys as mistreating you”

We had a friend group and in March decided to go on a group trip in June. Someone made the group chat to help start the organization, and off it went. For some time it had no activity so H started looking for places to stay, sending it in the chat. Everytime H sent something in the chat F and OF1 started to mock him, making fun of him. OF2 initiated a party in the group chat before we went on the trip. (side note: we most of the time were not asked beforehand) H was okay with it, only had one condition. He didn’t want a ”target on his back” because at this point he was fed up with the jokes, teasing, and sometimes bullying from F and OF1.

The party didn't happen because F and OF1 got offended by this.

After some sh*t stiring and bad mouthing in the group, they didn't want us to go and excluded us from the trip. We thought that was the end of it, both the trip and the friendship.

Then over the course of the next 7-8 month they made attempts to be friendly again, with more or less success.  
Few days ago when we played LoL and F mentioned to someone he thought we could have a New Year's Eve party at our house. When he approached me with it, I told him first he needs to clear that past issue because to us it looked like we were excluded for no good reason and was not comfortable throwing a party like that. He got offended and accused us of holding a grudge. He said 'We are not forced to do anything together.' and that was that.

At the end I realised that maybe the reason we were part of the group is we had our own place to crash at, everyone lives with their parents, and there is no problem with it, but I still find it disrespectful to always assume our welcome.

Do we really act like jerks to bring the past up?

This will be me, my boyfriend(25), my mom, dad, brother, SIL, cousin and my cousins wife.
We have been talking about going to eat and to a bar afterwards to play pool. As p
We most of the people are going to work early, we want this to be a weekend day.
My boyfriend has a weightlift tournament with his club one weekend in december, where he's lifting one of the days and he wants to be there the other days as well, to support his friends. I of course understand this completely. The next weekend he has a Christmas Party with the weightlift club Saturday and I'm working Friday evening. The weekends after it is Christmas and NYE.

My boyfriend and I was talking about dates for the birthday celebration and I asked ""But you won't be able to do it 9th-11th?"" And he said ""No... Unless I take a day off from the tournament"" I then said that it of course wouldn't have to be all day and that it could just be the evening. And asked if that would be okay, if we had no other possibilities. He didn't answer question but started talking about him always moving his plans and why noone else could move their plans. We have prior to this given a couple of experience gift to my family, where he one time found out that he had a tournament that weekend and the other time his sister planned her sons 1st birthday on the same day. Both times, especially the first, it has become an argument, as this was gifts that we had given together and now he wouldn't attend. But in the end we just did each our own thing. He works out 5 times a week and this quite often gets in the way, so he isn't able to do stuff with my family and I.
I think it's important to also say that we've been together for 9 years and there's been a pretty big chunk of this, where he did not prioritize me and that probably makes me react harder to stuff like this.

This specific time I tried to answer him but then ended up crying and going to our room. He decided to start packing his stuff for work and wanted to leave an hour before he had to. I asked him why he was leaving and ended up asking him to just stay away then. But instantly regretted and asked him to stay and talk about it. We both things we for sure regretted.
The thing is that we ended in a place where both it was mostly me who was in the wrong, because he always had to move his plans. Which I actually don't he has ever done.

After 2 weeks our contact broke completly up.

So after I met her, we were both drunk and started cuddling for hours. On the second day we met again.  Somehow (don´t ask me how) her ring was laying in my bathroom under the  toilet, so she asked me to give it back to her. We met again, I gave her the ring and she said to me that she only said that she´s missing me so I will come to a second  meeting and bring her ring.

After we drank again, the real fight started. She told me she could never be  with me, because I´m identical to her father and to conservative. I told her that I don´t want to be with her and send her home. It was late and  I wanted to bring her home but she denied. She started crying. I left without a word and on my way home  started crying too. I think I catched feelings because after 40 minutes I  called her to apologise for what I told her. I said while arguing that she should better dating somebody who likes to beat her like her father  and her ex-boyfriend.

She also apologised for her words and invited me over the next day. On that  day we didn´t argue. We started cuddling and talking. It was very  sensual, we were laying in bed for 6 hours. I felt bad for what I said to her, so I bought her  chocolate and apologised in person.

The next day was really weird. She said she will come over to me. Then  after 30 minutes she suddenly texted, that she don´t have time and won´t  come to me. I had to accept it and just wrote ""ok"". I think it was a shittest to test my reaction. I guess I made it because a few hours  later she texted me that she likes how her bed smells like me :).

So the next day we met again. Then I wanted to help her with a problem and she suddenly texted me that she doesn´t want  to text nor talk to me and I should let her alone. I called her calmly to ask what´s the problem. We met at night  and talked it out. She told me again that I´m to russian for her (btw  she´s russian herself). After that we get up and she went to my place.  There she told me, that she has feelings for me and we cuddled all night  and kissed for the first time.

I was a virgin and stressed out. I fingered her and she came, she asked me to do this.

Now comes the part where I´m the biggest asshole on this planet. I couldn´t accept that I made her feel well and she didn´t want to do the same for  me. I didn´t force her but I with my words I unintenionally created pressure on her. She did what i asked her to do, but only later realised that she didn´t really want to.

So, I recently ordered a bunch of anime figures for my family, and found two figures I thought were cute. They were on sale, and I wanted to buy some figures for myself too, so I bought them without any knowledge of the franchise they were from, as I wanted to start collecting figures I think look nice. However, a few days after buying them, I learned that they were from Nekopara, which apparently is a porn game involving extremely age-ambiguous characters, as in, most certainly minors. I wanted to cancel my order, however some of the items I bought for my family weren’t available anymore and so I wasn’t able to, or else they wouldn’t get any Christmas presents from me. I am unfortunately stuck with them. I still think they’re cute, and they aren’t sexualized at all (they are the pop up parade Chocolat and Vanilla ones), but I feel so guilty about it.

Nobody in our family has higher than a high school education, save for us. I have a Bachelors and my sister is currently working on her PhD. Obviously, we’re both proud of this, but my sister often brags to an extent that many in our family find uncomfortable or discouraging and she talks down to the people around her. When she began her program, she explained it in very technical terms that confused our aunt. When she was asked to clarify, my sister made a fuss about how it was so easy for her to understand and she forgets that not everyone can wrap their heads around it. It’s been an issue since she started her masters and I’ve admittedly been at my wits end with her for quite a while.

I hosted Thanksgiving this year. When we were eating, my sister was asked about her research and she went on a long, complicated spiel about her work. She was missing context, pulling out every ten cent word, getting super technical, and under-explaining every concept. She talked for about ten minutes straight, barely pausing for questions or comments. It dominated conversation. Eventually, I interrupted her and tried asking our dad about his work. My sister interrupted him and said she wasn’t finished, then continued talking. I told her I was finished listening to her and that she could talk all she wanted, but she’d need to do it in another room. She made some comments about my hosting and continued on. I stopped her again and told her that nobody was interested and she needed to be quiet, which she did. It was, admittedly, extremely awkward and quiet and my husband decided to just plow on and make conversation with an aunt of mine. After that, conversation carried on as usual with my sister being very, very quiet.

Afterwards, our parents scolded me for being rude but said my sister *was* being over the top, but I should’ve just let her talk. A few of our other relatives thanked me for cutting her off. 

Her fiancé called me yesterday morning and said I embarrassed my sister and made her feel ashamed. He implied I was jealous of her success and asked me to formally apologize to her. I said I’d apologize to her but I wouldn’t mean it and he hung up on me. 

I’ve thought it over and I can see how my approach was wrong, but I genuinely did not see any other option at the time. Always willing to learn, though, and seeking a new perspective.

So I’m from NI and in the UK we have a policy where if a student in school missies a certain amount of days, a teacher is then permitted to come and knock at the door of said pupil (and even enter their house when their parents aren’t home) if they’re late or absent from school.  In year 7 I had a brief period of insomnia that caused me to miss a lot of school and therefore a teacher would come to my house 5 minutes down the road every time i was even a slight bit late. However, this was really distressing for me. Not only because I wasn’t sleeping but the teacher who was coming into my house every few mornings was a MALE TEACHER and one who really did not like me for whatever reason. After this I came into school on time a lot more but whatever  reason the teacher was still sent to my house even after my attendance improved. And the year after, and the year after. I’m in year 10 now and every time i was even 2 minutes late for register for the past few years I’ve had this teacher come into my house. It pisses me off every time it happens, especially if I have a note to be off from school and a valid reason not to be there. I’ve talked to the teachers about it but they still think it’s “necessary” even though my attendance is over 90%. Anyway, my last straw came this morning when I was running ever so slightly late to school and while I was literally TWO MINUTES away, this teacher pulls up next to me on the road and starts giving out (as he usually does) and makes me get into the car and drive me into the car park of the school. Loads of people in my year saw me get out of the car and people starting talking about it. It was so embarrassing. I was talking to my friend about it and a teacher overheard me calling him ‘ridiculous’ and she told the teacher (home visit guy) about my conversation with my friend and he called me out of class and started giving out to me for being “disrespectful” and that he’s only trying to “help me and I need to learn to appreciate that” I was already having a bad day so I snapped at him, i told him that this whole coming to my house thing was unethical and i have a very good attendance now so I don’t need to have someone come to my house or follow me down the street, I also talked about the embarrassment of getting out of his car and the fact he’s giving out to me over a conversation I had with my friend. I tried not to be disrespectful but looking  back on it I was definitely giving out to him. I now have 3 weeks detention and I’m thinking about arguing even more to get out of it but I feel like I fucked up by arguing this teacher. So, pls tell me AITA?

I ( 23 F) and my boyfriend (26 M) are together for 2 years and we have happily lived together since then. To reduce costs, we decide to live in his mother's apartment, who no longer occupied it because she lived with her boyfriend

Just before moving, his mother’s situation changes: she leaves her boyfriend.But she can't move in alone, because she can't afford to pay her rent with her income.

Then we move in as a three. On paper, it looks good : We all get along well, she will be happy to take care of her son and, it will cost little 

as an introvert, the opposite of her despite what she may say, I doubt but I thought sharing it could be a bad signal him (my first mistake)

So here goes the summer, the more time passes, the more I feel oppressed. She talks a lot: on her own, to the animals, to say what she eats/does/thinks. And when she's not talking, she's singing. And if not, she's on the phone. 

I feel like I'm living in a constant mess.

strange things happen. She comes to tell me her love stories in my room while I'm still in my bed on the morning. After having surprised my boyfriend and me in a serious discussion, she asks us if ""it's okay"" by insinuating that she is talking about our relationship, something she will not assume despite my asking her. that doesn't suit me at all.

I try to say what I feel to my boyfriend. finally I dare tell her that I need to be alone, ask her not to do the household chores even if it ""pleases her""  so as not to feel indebted to me and to have an exhaustive list that I don't want to hear.

But I'm not saying everything (another mistake) So my behavior changes. I lower my head when she passes to show I am not open to discussion. I put my hair on the side where she is so as not to meet her gaze. I put my headphones on even if I'm not listening to sound busy. I lock my room. I manage to organize what I have to do in the living room and the kitchen and the toilets to limit contact.

Over time, we finally have evenings where I can be natural with my boyfriend. We are both alone, and we eat in peace.

Now it's my boyfriend's behavior that changes although I can also link to the huge job he has at the moment. But He talks as if he were my father (don't put things on the bed, don't put the glass on the edge of the table, don't put pepper in the pasta water … ) Things he never said before.

But a light comes on : we receive an unexpected purchase proposal for a property that we both love !

What blew things up was that he even asked me if I wanted to live with my mother until we buy the house (with travel 4 hours to work there and back for 4 months)

After having insisted, he admits that he has the impression that he is rejecting his own mother that she hides in her room at night to eat her food, and she doesn't dare to do anything anymore.

He reassured telling me that he just thought of this idea because he feels bad for me

I tried to stay focused on the topic but I kind of rant about some of my feelings because it’s been a while since I've talked about them.**

**Context:** I (18)  early graduated and transferred to Davis (currently my first quarter), my sister (16) also early graduated and enrolled as freshmen (also her first quarter). We’ve been in the same classes, programs, extracurricular, and now the same university. If I ever wanted to go to a birthday party when I was younger they’d always say to take my sister. But I’ve actually never gone to a birthday party or anywhere with friends for that matter since my dad is too overprotective. Which is unfortunate because most of my friends stopped asking me and now I don’t know how to make friends. Anyways I’m going off topic. But I’ll add one more thing that is important for context, my family is low income and my dad lost his job in covid so I helped them start a trucking company and do all the paperwork and brokering (started when I was 16).

**Actual Issue:** I'm sick and tired of having to deal with my sister. I live in the university apartments since that’s standard housing for transfers and she lives in the dorm since that's the standard option for freshmen. My parents put us in the same schools, college, and now university. He even wanted us to enroll together and we did. My parents need to understand that we can't live together forever. My dad pushes the idea too often, I should take care of her cause she’s younger but there’s only a 2 year difference. If I can take care of myself why can’t she. Initially I agreed w/my parents (she at dorm M-F and my place on S-S. But she’s always here. I’ve always wanted my own space and to be alone for once but now she’s in the way. Her main argument is that we’re lactovegetarian and dining does not have good options but she has a communal kitchen. And she always asks me to cook. I cook on my time but she always asks me to make food and complains when I don't. It's really annoying and inconsiderate. So I tried setting rules that if she wanted me to cook and was gonna live here the least she could do is the dishes and laundry (she only puts them in the machine, I fold them and put them away). Whenever she comes I’m in a bad mood. I just feel so content when I’m alone even though I’m depressed and maybe do want friends but i don’t need or get that comfort from her. I’m tired of people in general and of people. I feel even more emotionally drained with her. My parents are planning to cancel her housing so she can stay with me which I guess I'm fine with because we're not that financially well off. But that's not until 1-2 months so I don't know why she keeps forcing her way into my place. I understand my parents though.

Dallas and I played the game way more than Watermellon has so we are a lot higher level than him. Dallas is almost max rank so he has almost every helicopter and an A-10. I bought a DLC that gives me a free Chinook and a few extra cosmetics for my player. Watermellon had originally introduced us to the game where he had the DLC already, so he would fly us to where we need to go. Dallas was feeling good this day so he wanted to fly his heli to the base we were supposed to raid, but Watermellon insisted he was a better pilot and that he should fly. I also wanted to fly because I spent $5 us on the DLC. I kept flying from one of the FOBs to the base they were at which angered Watermellon. Dallas and I kept talking so we couldn't hear Watermellon speaking. He eventually got upset because he thought we were ignoring him. Dallas eventually told Watermellon to ""shut up I'm talking to Akira (my nickname)"" This made Watermellon really mad so he snapped back, Dallas didn't like Watermellon's attitude so he started bullying Watermellon. The whole time I said and did nothing. Watermellon cried from how harsh Dallas had treated him and I felt really bad

I always had reservations about small kids around dogs and knew to be careful. I, in no way, expected her dogs to not react if my kids did something, they're dogs. But kids are kids as well and I watched her the best I could. 

On a visit, one of her chihuahuas got too close and nipped at my daughters face when my daughter reacted to the dog being so close (I shouldn't have let the dog so close). When I confronted my mom, she declined it had even happened even though we were both sitting close enough to see it happen. No one was injured but I was afraid something worse would happen. So, we promptly left and I later called to ask if she would be willing to put her dogs away behind a gate (as she already owns one) in a room so my daughter would be safe. She said she saw no reason to and didn't want to keep her dogs in such a small space for our visit (which would usually last an hour or 2). I then told her that for the safety of my daughter, I wouldn't feel comfortable coming over with dogs freely roaming, and we wouldn't be returning unless she changed her mind. 
Now she's claiming I'm keep her granddaughter away from her and not allowing her to see her, even though she's free to come visit our house anytime.

There have been times where I’ll tell him I’m heading to class and will see him right after, but when I tell him I’m outside his house hours later, he’ll be in the process of STARTING his shower, didn’t brush his teeth, didn’t put on clothes. So I’m stuck waiting for 30 min in the car until he gets ready. He does this several times a week, multiple times a month. Even when I get out of work, he’ll have me wait 20 min for him outside. There’s been a time specifically where he was wit his friends and told me to come get him at 1 so we can smoke before I head to work at 4, but didn’t appear till 3 and when he appeared , told me we still needed to go to the dispensary. This situation sparked up today’s argument because he had me waiting in the car for him for 2 hours and he could of told me to go to the dispo WHILE I WAS WAITING but instead he waited till he seen me to tell me what we needed to do like I didn’t have to start driving to work at 3:30. Todays argument I got to class at 11;30 and told him I’ll see him after. He went to my college and knows every class is 1 hr 20 min long and even has my class schedule saved on his phone. I texted him when I got out that I was on my way then texted me I was outside when I got to his house. He didn’t respond so I FaceTimed him and seen him sitting on the toilet and he said he still needed to shower and eat. I got mad because he knew when I got out of class and knew I was coming. His argument was that I didn’t give him enough time to get ready between the time I texted I was coming and by the time I got there because the messages were less then 10 min apart. My argument is the school is less then 10 min from the house (same school I been going to for 4 years) so he needs to not act clueless and get a grip on reality. He does this ALOT and after what happened with his friends, I’m tired of waiting on him. I feel like he’s taking advantage of me and constantly making me wait 30min+ for him.

We divided work like this: 50% will be done by me, the rest done by my other 3 teammates.

One of them hasn't written a single line of code the entire semester for this project. He only touched the code 2 days after the submission date. We submitted an incomplete file last Sunday, and we intended to send the professor a complete file by tomorrow. I was disappointed because he's a smart dude with a high GPA in CS. I gave this guy a second chance and told him he has till tomorrow 1 hour before the defense to finish the feature assigned to him.

His excuses are:

He has other projects where he's getting fucked.

His IDE's emulator isn't working. 2 weeks ago he said he'd go fix it constantly but he never did. Another teammate had the same problem, yet still worked on the project.

He has no internet right now so he cant work on the project (Despite the project being a 20 mb file and that it only needs code not wi-fi).

**What I did that might be judged:**

First of all, he wanted to do a meeting **2 days** after submission for me told explain the code to him. he was in the labs coding the feature we assigned. I had to also go there because he had an error he didn't know how to fix. I went, fixed the error, refused to explain to him the code of the project (nearly 30 java files), and I went to the next meeting I had for a different project which I was late to because I had to help him. I did tell him that as he was coding, if he needed help I'd be available by text.

Second of all today, he asked me (for the third time), what the time for tomorrow's defense is. I told him ""I'm not letting you go to the project  \*insert laughing emoji\* unless you finish the x feature"" It's a literal translation for another language, so it sounds wonky. He was offended by this and left the group.

Another thing I did was that I accidentally chose a time slot for our defense where he has 10 more minutes of another class. I had to do this because none of my teammates were responding with their schedules and I had to take a decision so that we could get a good time.

**From his perspective:**

He's allowing people from other projects to do the same as what he's doing to me right now without punishing them. So I should do the same too.

I am rude in the way I talk to him in that last message. 

His emulator isnt working, and he doesn't have internet right now, so I'm being unfair.

Before I get grilled for wanting to avoid my grandma I'll offer some context: my parents got divorced when I was only a newborn but I have been made aware of how bad she treated my mum before the divorce and even told her she needed to suck up my dad's infidelity and stay with him because that's what men do. I have also witnessed first hand how she is mean to my aunt (aunt by marriage) and belittles her every time. 

My grandpa got very ill and passed a few years back. His sons tried having nurses at home to take care of him so my grandma wouldn't have to do the work but she would be mean to the nurses, yell at them and not allow them to do their work. She would go as far as not allow them to change my grandpa if he had peed himself on account to washing to much and it being fine as it was. The house reeked of pee whenever we visited. We also started noticing he had bruises here and there and they started getting worse. One of the nurses came clean and said she saw her hitting him. They eventually moved my dad into a nursing home and he passed more peacefully there. 

I can't stand having to talk to her and pretend, I can't even tell her that I love her back or that I wish her well because I don't. I don't care for her and to me she's just another human breathing oxygen. My brother says I need to suck it up for my dad and play pretend but it's just becoming a huge burden tbh.

We were together for nearly 5 years. We are still friendly toward each other but of course there are still disagreements. 

My ex has talked to his coworkers about me, about our issues, and has told me multiple times in conversation that his coworkers “hate” me, due to the fact that he was constantly complaining about me, never explaining the things he had done wrong, etc. I’m not gonna say I was the perfect girlfriend, but there were a lot of nice things that he could’ve said about me too. I have never even met these people in person so all they know about me is what he has said. 

I have never had anyone in my life tell me I was as “mean“ and “rude” and “embarrassing” as he has described me. Literally never. 

With Xmas coming around his coworkers want to come by our place to hang out with him. He approached me and asked me to stay at a friends house for the night so they could come over. 

For me, I was shocked. This is still my home until the lease is up. I still pay half of the rent, even though he makes way more than me. Some months, I actually end up paying more than him once the utility bills come in. I told him that I thought it was disrespectful for him to ask me to leave my home so that people who don’t like me could come in and put an ornament on the Xmas tree that I bought and he didn’t even help put up.

I asked him to let me know what date he’s inviting them over so I can just get a hotel. He doesn’t want me pay for a hotel, because I think that would make him feel guilty. So, instead he’s asking me to stay at a friends house, but why do I need to put that burden on my friend? Why is it any of her business? I know my friends like me, but do I really have to bug them so I can stay the night on their couch when I have a perfectly fine room that I already pay for?

So, am I the asshole for being upset that my ex is kicking me out of our apartment for a night to invite his coworkers that hate me?

When I confronted her about it, she stated that she wanted a divorce and that she has been unhappy in our 10 year marriage, for years. 

Her initial communication with this person was through discord, but after I had confronted her, and the news about wanting a divorce, it went to just phone calls instead. She also began having….vocal relations with him on the phone, while we still live in the same house (tagging NSFW for this paragraph, just in case).

I was infuriated. I wanted to know who she was doing that with. What made him a better option than me? I pulled the phone records, and after a little googling, discovered TWO people that she was doing that with. When I THEN confronted her about it, and added that I didn’t want to hear that in my own home, she responded with “my body, my choice.” She also said that pulling the phone numbers and googling was a breach of her privacy. 

As it sits now, we are going through the divorce process. She got a phone in her own name, and continues this nearly every night. It’s driving me crazy.

Last year my mother had major open heart surgery and wound up staying with me for three months. My brother, whom I do not at all jive with, stayed with me during that time as well. 

During this time I picked up smoking again after having quit a couple years before. 

After they left I started working myself toward quitting again. My GF got back from a through hike that October. Because she's been extremely harsh about my smoking in the past, I kept it to myself and kept working in quitting. 

Obviously she found out and flipped out. Going so far as to demand I tell her every time I light up. 

Seems pretty insane, but I get it. So I have every time for over a year. She's still beating me over the head about it. 

So that sets the stage, I guess. 

Now we've also been in an open relationship while we've been together, though I haven't felt the need or desire to step beyond its bounds until recently, she has repeatedly. Which honestly isn't a problem as long as she's honest about it. 

After multiple relationships beyond our own crash and burn, she makes me promise not to let her do it again. 

Something im completely uncomfortable with, but she pushes until I promise. She doesn't want me to see or be with anyone else either because she wants to work on us. 

So come August, she's off working a job under the table in OR after landing a free trip to Iceland. 

I asked her to come home for my birthday. 

At the time, she tells me she can't afford the trip and has to work. 

Okay, I get that. Sucks but it is what it is. 

About a week after that convo she tells me she's going back to Iceland. 

Oookay...? 

Find out later she'd hooked up with a guy while she was there the first time. Thats entirely why she's going back. 

Literally flew out of the country on my birthday to be with someone else for three months. 

Hid the whole relationship from me. 

Obviously I'm pretty fucking hurt. 

Meanwhile she's telling me how much work she's been doing to get over the smoking...over a year ago. 

Am I the asshole for calling her on lying to me, not being there for me, cheating on me, and generally being shitty for trying to rationalize all of it? 

Yeah, I did hide the smoking and it wasn't okay. I've also been absolutely fucking tripping over myself to make it up to her.
