Another time I asked him for work help and he snapped at me that he's not my fucking babysitter. He's also dismissed issues I've brought up about work saying i'm over reacting even though senior colleagues have gone on to agree with me.

last week we had a big event then party with our clients. J and I had a presentation @ 9:30am the next day, we had been working on it for two weeks and I was nervous as we were presenting to big name brands in our industry. I love partying as much as anyone but had decided I would go home early to be up and ready especially as our city was having transport strikes over these days. J came up to me and said our colleague (M) had bought snow and can we pinky promise not to do any bc of our presentation. I said i wouldn't and was going home early anyway.

Fastforward to the next morning, I'm on the way to work and J messages saying can i being my company hoodie as he stayed in M's hotel as they were out late and he's wearing the same clothes as yesterday. I told him I was already on the way to work. Despite our issues I could have brought it.

I didn't say anything more about it. i was annoyed but continued to joke around with him. M tells me he's proud of me that I didn't stay out to party. J says we need to develop something stronger thank pinky promise as he ended up doing the snow and i respond that it's not my proble he can't keep promises.

Some time later J and I get into a fight where he calls me unprofessional because i didn't want to talk to him after he was rude to me. I complained to M saying how dare J call me unprofessional for that considering his behaviour before and how he showed up to our presentation. 

X defends him saying he was sad about him and his husband breaking up (something he told me 2 weeks ago) around 3:30am and J stayed to comfort him. That what if it was me? He also says i should take this to my grave. (He didn't tell me about the snow). I responded that J should have been home already at 3:30 am and that I wouldn't even have been there at that time. I also asked M if he was ok?

M thinks I'm being unfair since it was ""his fault"" J was out and wore the same clothes from the night before. I told him even though it doesn't change much ""from a professional standpoint"" he should let everyone else who is talking about this know. He refused but said i'm being unfair to J for being annoyed at him.

My mother has always been an addict. My own father was her drug dealer. She had me at 36 while she was already a married woman with 3 children. My mother actually left her husband for my father. She then proceeded to lose custody of my older siblings in the divorce. My mother was with my father for 10 years, during all those years my first memories where sleeping in cars and living in a shed in the backyard of a condemned house. I don’t remember ever going hungry though. After that we lived  in the same apartment for a long time just us, and my little sister she had later on (same dad). These years I would honestly say were my happiest childhood years. Fast forward a few years, my mom has lived the past 3 years with her, my step dad and little sister in me and my husbands house without paying rent. My husband eventually gave them 3 months to find a new place but they didn’t. My stepdad was already staying at a place he was building so eventually they all moved there. The reason my Hsiang kicked them out was because my mom and sister never cleaned and I stared finding meth pipes around the house. The last straw was when my 1 year old found a pipe while she began playing in the spare rooms closet. Also during this my sister was bring strange guys to stay around the house. So now me and my siblings are evading mouth mother no one wants to be responsible for her. 

But today I got this message from her:

“I don't know what “y” (my sister) said to you but the  truth is i go some days with out food “M” (my stepfather) still hurts me sometimes and I'm embarrassed to ask anyone for help i have severe depression i stay in bed for days . I'm not asking for anything i just am very long and always  pain makes it hard to walk. I don't say anything b cause I guess my pride is a problem i am clean. It's been 6 or 7 months no desire to do drugs anyways I needed to get that off my chest. I just feel so alone. I love you and miss you and miss “k” (my daughter) she was sunshine. I'm sorry for being a bad mom, I really tried to be there for you always. Thank you for everything you have been a great daughter even though we have had our problems. I really just want to sleep and never wake up to make all the pain go away. Love you always, mom.”

It started good, we dated and apparently he fell in love with me and I with him. 
But it never really clicked with us, and it felt wrong for me, I saw him more and more as a best friend rather than someone who should/could be a boyfriend.

Over the years it didn’t worked out and we separated and went back together. So he had trust issues and whenever we tried to worked it out, he would slam the “it was my fault etc”, it was  but he shouldn’t come up with it every time we talk. A few times he said that he only wants to fuck me ( we never had sex) so he can go on with his life. He is pissed when I talk about men in my work or college.
I liked the attention that he gives me, I feel like he is the only men that I know that he ain’t lying, I’m realizing more and more that I kept him in the leash and he doesn’t deserve it.

So this year it was different we weren’t in high school anymore and are more “adults”. So we tried it, but than he insult me and called me a whore bc I had with a few boys something (I haven’t dated this year, only with him) for me it was serious but after he said it I ignored him for a few days for clean my head. I know we aren’t good for each other and that I hurt him more than he me. 

I want him to be happy and go on without me. So I said that we should quit with this devils circle and go on with our life’s. He didn’t understand it and tried everything so I can stay, I explained to him that It won’t work out and that we should stop trying it, the past is the past and we can’t forget it. He had a mental breakdown and insult me with every insult in earth. I tried to stay calm and after a while I didn’t tried to explain it and just agreed with everything that he said. 

After a few days he messaged me again and asked if we could go out to eat something. I said that it won’t happen and he should stop messaging me. He started again that it’s my fault that this relationship isn’t working out, that I don’t love him etc. I agreed with everything so he could stop, after a while he said he would hurt himself bc nobody loves him, I tried do calm him down and saying that just bc I don’t love him like he needs it doesn’t mean everybody hates him and that he shouldn’t hurt himself bc of a stupid girl.
He went on and insult me again and wanted to know why it will never happen. He just can’t understand that it won’t happen tries everything so I won’t leave him. 
So here goes to the part: After he said that he isn’t valued to be loved or something I snapped and said I’m a lesbian. 
I know I shouldn’t have said it and I feel terrible. Even tho he know I  kissed a few girls it wasn’t something like “lesbian vibes”. 

He more or less accepted it and is apparently snoring coke so he can forget. 
I shouldn’t have said it, lied to him and give some terrible excuse just bc I want him off my back.

Aita? My roomate L has been bitchy lately and has me and my Suitemate K confused on what we’re supposed to do. So I was hanging out in our living room area and L came out to chill which was fine. L then went back into our bedroom and I said oh I get it you don’t wanna spend time with me as a joke. And L said no I just wanted to watch my own stuff this is fine by me no hard feelings. We had plans to go grocery shopping the next day. So we discuss what we are gonna buy (we pay for our own stuff). L said I’ll text you my grocery list.

 Then K comes home from work. L comes out to say hi and proceeds to hangout with us in the living room. All is well we three are catching up with our day then as we’re talking L puts on headphones and is on tiktok. K and I disregards this as she does this often and it annoys us but we learn to live with it. Then L text me saying she doesn’t think K wants to talk to L. I say she’s probably just tired. We three continue to talk but since L has headphones in she “can’t” hear what were saying. K and I talk and ask L something and she says huh and we repeat it but she keeps saying huh. So we just say nvm. After that happening like three more times L goes to the bedroom. Then K and I continue our convo. Sometime later L comes out and asks us to go to get food. I am full and K just ate. But I say sure let me put on pants in a uhhhhg I’m tired tone. Then L says nvm and goes back to the bedroom. I’m confused as to what just happened. But a thought she changed her mind. I later look at my phone and see a text w/only four items on it. I’m confused so I text her is this it? I don’t get a reply which is odd bc she’s always on her phone. I later confront her and said I thought you needed other things. She said no and I thought nothing of it and went to bed. I tell her to text me tomorrow when she’s off of work so we can go grocery shopping. 

She never text me. We didn’t end up going. Which makes me mad bc this is the second time she’s blown me off. I saved a spot in my schedule for it as it was a busy day. So I decide to go grocery shopping with K. As we talk we decide to have game night with some mutual friends. We invite L but get no reply. Again odd bc she’s always on her phone. So she’s actively ignoring us. 

Then the next day we have a last minute idea to hold Friendsgiving. We again invite L and again no reply. So I ask L in person. She says no bc she has work but we say we can wait until she gets off so she is included. She doesn’t reply. So K messages her about it and she says she might make it. K senses something is off and asks about it but L doesn’t reply. 

Next day We have the Friendsgiving. We keep trying to inform L of the plans but she is not responding. So we make her a togo plate. She doesn’t eat it even though she has no food and keeps looking for something to eat. and now she is giving us the silent treatment.

For context/the story;

About 10 years ago, the decades long friendship of my dad &amp; a bunch of his buddies was hanging by a thread due to petty jealousy over…who knows, honestly. Whatever. He stayed friends with some of them, Jason; &amp; was kinda no longer considering another, Bill, as a friend. Using real names for my convenience, &amp; because I highly doubt anyone else I know has even heard of Reddit. Idgaf. Anyway, they’re all the partying type, &amp; my dad was usually the host of said house parties. I use to go often because 1) he’s my dad, obviously &amp; 2) I really enjoy music &amp; hanging out with my dad, step mom, &amp; siblings etc.

Zone in on one night during the time when all the petty bullshit was happening between my dad &amp; his friends/not friends, whatever. It’s a party weekend/night. I don’t go because I had a headache &amp; had decided to stay the night at my grandma’s &amp; watch movies until I finally passed out instead. My dad’s friend Bill decides to try some desperate measures to try to demonize Jason, in attempts to make him get dropped so Bill can secure his spot as my dad’s favorite friend or whatever lame shit.

*Bill makes up some bullshit ass story that Jason, who was like an uncle to me, has been grooming me &amp; that we fucked on my dad’s couch during the party that night. The night I didn’t even fucking go*. Not only does this story almost get Jason’s ass beat by AT LEAST a dozen people, including but not limited to my parents &amp; step parents, but it also nearly ruins my reputation as a freshly-turned-18 year old girl. **I have hated Bill ever since**. Jason was like an uncle to me, &amp; never did or said any weird shit to me like that. &amp; Bill was like an uncle to me, &amp; he does THAT to me??? Like, he could’ve picked LITERALLY anyone else. Hell, he could’ve picked my *sister* to be the helpless little girl of his lie! But nooooo, he had to betray **ME** &amp; Yes, I view it as a betrayal.

Like sure, he made up the lie to try to ruin Jason’s spot as my dad’s best friend, obviously, but he also ruined/almost ruined MY life as well. &amp; Yet he has the fucking NERVE &amp; AUDACITY to be like “oh hey (my name) how are you? I miss you!” Like how about you miss me with that bullshit before I make you miss a step on the stairs, traitor.

He got very angry about all his stuff being packed up and indicated that he hadn't really intended to leave for good, just for a week or so to calm down. This is something he had done previously (his parents had an empty apartment he was able to use) so I knew that had probably been his intention but I had had enough with the relationship. He hasn't earned any sort of income for a decade, so money was tight. He is very critical of my parenting but hardly did a thing to help with the kids or around the house and constantly wanted money. He is a great cook so would help with meals, but only if he had the exact ingredients he wanted, often these were very expensive.

The final straw really was that he became convinced I was having an affair when I was at work (I work from home) and would come and sit behind me while I tried to work, staring at the computer screen and talking constantly. It was incredibly difficult to work like this.

I definitely have my faults too and I put up with a lot of this because I assumed I was equally annoying or inconsiderate and that we have to make concessions, but being accuse of cheating was the end for me. And since he left, life has been a lot easier - even with three kids. I don't feel anxious all the time.

Problem is, now he cannot stay in the apartment anymore and while he actually has the option of a free flat with some work attached, he doesn't like the location - it's 15 km from us which he thinks is 'too far'.  He's dropping hints about moving in again and using the kids as a reason. He says they have suffered with him gone and I am bringing them up very badly, with too little discipline. I really don't want him back at all but I am wondering whether this is a selfish perspective and whether it would be better to tolerate his behaviour in order to let the kids grow up with two parents. (The oldest child says they don't want him back at all, the other two are too young to ask, really).

I know he will struggle on his own, but I also feel he had several months to find work/accommodation and so he doesn't \*have\* to be homeless... but suspect he could end up that way.. He is very proud and has been out of work for so long because no job is good enough. He also won\\t claim benefits because he is too proud to do so

So I am asking, WIBTA if I told him he can't move back in?

The team rented out a nightclub and threw a party to celebrate winning the championship. 

Since it’s a nightclub, you have to be 21. 75% of the team is under 21, but every girl on the team except me who is underage has a fake ID. They’re super popular at school. 

So one girl was going to let me in through the back door, since I’m on the team too and should be allowed to participate in a team event. Not to mention, I paid to go since everyone on team had to buy a ticket.

She tried, and was stopped by a the bouncer boy, who made both of us leave. He was extremely aggressive and rude. 

My friend and I were furious that he ruined our celebration and started searching for his information online. We found out he’s a 25-year-old nontraditional student at our school, and we were able to look up his building since every student’s dorm is listed on an internal directory if you know their name.

He’s currently trying to join several social societies at school. My school is extremely strict about parties since they hate being liable for students drinking, so all parties must be registered and end by midnight, or they’ll be shut down. So the only way you can party is by joining a social society that throws parties. They have property of their own and aren’t monitored by the school.

I happen to know the social chairs and presidents of all the social societies at our school, since most of them are athletes or friends of athletes. So my friend and I contacted all of them and told him the guy they shouldn’t admit the guy since he ruined our sport’s championship celebration. And they said they can blacklist him. He’s one applicant of hundreds, so they lose nothing. I figure since he ruined our night, it’s only fair that I ruin his night for the rest of his time at our school. 

Frankly, I think he should be blacklisted even just because I don’t think a bouncer is a wanted addition to any social society. Bouncers ruin parties, they don’t get to attend them.

He confronted my friend and I asking why we’ve told people to be wary of admitting him. I told him exactly why. He said it was his job. Well, maybe he’s using the “just following orders” defense, but it’s my job to inform friends of who shouldn’t join their society.

We remained intimate in the time of him staying at my apartment so it felt like we were still dating. The first couple of weeks he took care of me while I had COVID, I felt grateful to have him. After two months he’d started a job, but it didn’t last long so I gave him the option to stay home and do domestic chores and focus on his GED. He agreed, but after this I noticed things not being done before coming home and him constantly on the game.

We fly out tomorrow and have to wake up early to check out and for another sightseeing plan before our flight.

We indeed did go out for food and drinks after a long day of sightseeing. It was a fun evening and we had about 3 drinks each and good conversation. I got kind of drunk and he said he was barely buzzed. As we were walking back from the restaurant, I (drunkenly) had the idea to order alcohol using Uber Eats and keep drinking and watch a movie. We got back to the Airbnb and ordered alcohol - a 12 pack as that was all available. Bear in mind I paid for the dinner and the drinks and the Uber Eats (as well as most things on the trip).

It took a while (45 minutes or so) to get here and in the meantime I sobered up. When we finally got around to sitting down with the drinks, I realized I didn’t really like the drinks we ordered and drank only one. As we watched funny videos and the movie, he drank about 3 drinks. He asked me why I wasn’t drinking faster and I said I don’t really like the taste of the beverage. 

We continued watching, a while later I noticed him acting annoyed and shooting me looks and ignoring me. I asked him why he looked annoyed and he repeatedly stated that I haven’t drank more than one drink and that I backed out of our mutually agreed upon plan. I said that I had valid reasons for continuing to not drink (sobering up, not liking the alcohol, thinking of tomorrows tasks) and he repeatedly kept going in circles and saying I backed out of the plan and he was annoyed and there was no point in ordering the alcohol. At this I got mad and we ended up arguing and I told him to grow up and that someone else’s choice to not drink is not his business and that why does or matter if we’re just watching a movie how many drinks I had, and that I’m sorry he can’t enjoy the movie with me unless I’m drinking more. He kept repeating that I backed out of the plan and left him to drink by himself and that “why did i order alcohol then”.

He's never really been ""good at life"". He's had a few jobs here and there, but mostly just stuff like Walmart, McDonald's, and he delivered pizzas for about a month. He's never held down a job for more than 60 days. He dropped out of High School, and never bothered to get a GED, let alone any college/trade school. He mostly just sits in his room drinking my booze, smoking my pot, and eating my food while he plays whatever JRPG he's currently obsessed with.  

I don't mind this, I truly don't. I did well in life, and my wife invested our money **very** well. So we're comfortable. I have more than enough resources to support him fully for the rest of our lives, and I intend to do so. He's not taking food out of my kids mouths, he's not cutting into their college funds. It's literally extra money that I would just be squirreling away if I didn't spend it on him.   

Last night at dinner, my wife told me that her brother lost his job (he worked for a company that recently had MASSIVE layoffs, so it was due to no fault of his own), and asked me if we could float him some cash for bills and stuff while he finds a new job. I told her to have him send me an estimate of how much he needs to cover 6 months, and that was that (or so I thought).  


My brother proceeded to head over to Facebook and post a rant about how people need to be more self-reliant and not ask for handouts they didn't earn. He didn't mention my BiL by name, but it was pretty clear that that's what triggered his rant.   

I commented on his post, and I asked him how living off of me for the past 9 years was ""self-reliant"". I told him that he is in an incredibly privileged position, because not everyone has a millionaire brother to pay all their bills for them. I also asked how the allowance I give him every week is not a ""handout"". 

Anyway, a bunch of his friends from his video game started clowning on him in the comments (apparently he tells people online that he's an investment banker). He deleted the post, and has not come out of his room since (there is an en-suite bathroom, don't worry).

It appeared accurate to colour and approximately half way between the jaw and shoulders in length.

The seller has a public meet up location for those not wanting delivery, as I live locally I met her. She had the wig in its original packaging (she was selling only a few new wigs). I opened the top of the package and checked the bangs and the material and all seemed in order. I was not able to try it on as the public space had no mirrors, or tables or benches etc, think just after closing at a shopping centre, it's also light out where I am untill well after we met so safety isn't a huge concern at that time in the area. 

The seller asked for more than what she had advertised for and when I called her out on it she let it go saying 'oh my mistake'. I thought simple mistake since she had a collection of wigs for sale. 

Once I had brought the wig home and went through the process of trying it on I noticed it was significantly shorter than she had advertised. Chin length and even shorter at the back. This did not align with the sale price or product pictures or videos. 

I contacted her and pointed out these differences, asking if she had meant to give me that wig incase she had mixed up the bags or something similar. 

She told me she advertised it accurately and that I should have unpacked the wig fully (multiple layers of packaging) and tried it on by the side of the street, that I could onsell it now because she didn't care.

I was taken a back by how rude she had been in that message. I replied letting her know that I wasn't angry and meant no disrespect, that I was simply asking because the wig wasn't what it was advertised as. I didn't ask for a refund and was just about to finish my request that she checks her stock and product promotion to be sure that there wasn't an error when she blocked me. 

She blocked all of my contact information and blocked my access to her business page to write a review. I contacted the company she was selling through letting them know about the inconsistencies between the advertised product and the product I received and how she was rude to me.

Math and English are mostly fine, but I am struggling in History because that topic doesn't interest me very much and a lot of the assessments involve research and writing essay whereas I score better in tests. At the end of the semester, my average was 64%. For this semester, my average is 75%. However, you have to have an average of 65% through the whole year to stay in AEP, and currently my average for that is 63%.

I have also brought this up a few times with my parents and asked them if I could quit since I was finding it difficult, didn't enjoy the subject and felt that I would do better in the general class. They said no every single time, because according to them it's better to be in a higher class and get crap scores than be in a lower class and get really good scores.

My teacher pulled me aside and said that although I was doing okay, he was wondering whether I was alright in AEP and whether I wanted to quit or not. I agreed to, since I didn't like the subject anyway and I could get a better grade since it's easier to learn in the other class (I get really good scores in Science than the other subjects, like around 80%-90% because that's the one subject I'm not in AEP for) . So we agreed that I would stay in AEP for the rest of the year since there were no more tests, and then I would go to the general class next year. For context, I was completely fine with this and had even wanted to quit, only I wasn't able to because of my parents.

However now I feel like an AH because I know that my parents wanted me to be in that class and are probably going to be really mad at me because I quit. I haven't told them yet because of this reason.

I F14 and my mom F36 have a cat who has recently needed esophagus surgery because he ate an object that was causing harm and he couldn’t digest food. This cat is my moms cat and has no interest in me as i don’t interact with him because he doesn’t like me so i thought it will be best just to not interact with the cat altogether. The surgery was $3000 not including taxes and other expenses, after everything was said and done it comes to about $3500. We are lower middle class as we only have one income. The cat is already in not great health condition let alone the cause of needing the surgery, she took her cat to the vet and with the situation the vet said that she has two options, the options being either we put him down or we pay for the surgery. Of course she choose the surgery although she was really considering the other option. I told her that it makes more sense to put him down but i was empathetic to how she doesn’t want to and supported her in the decision of going on with the surgery. My mom had to borrow thousands from my great grandmother to pay for it. The cat has made it through surgery and is now recovering. the vet told us to keep an eye on him as he’s living in a cat carrier currently. my mom made me watch him last night for two hours in the middle of the night until 4am. I was extremely tired but she wanted me to watch him so she can sleep. i am also starting school this week, but this isn’t a normal school, it is an online school and requires lots of independence and time management. I am very stressed out because i am starting three months later than everyone else for mental health issues and i struggle with school a lot. So after being extremely tired because i am menstruating and going through much stress this week she wakes me up early so i ended up getting around 4 hours of non consecutive sleep and then she asks me to watch the cat again during the day while i have online school. i am trying my next to multitask but she gets mad at me. Tonight rolls around and she comes in saying that she needs me to watch the cat again the full night so she can sleep because she’s tired (she doesn’t work this week and her work is one 5 hour shift). I told her i will not be willing to do so because i have school and i didn’t get a lot complete and that my mental health is not very good right now and i don’t want to stay up the whole night again. she then yells at me and says that i do nothing and i’m worthless and all i do is sabotage her life and i can’t help her at all. she storms out into her room and slams the door.

When I came back my brother's cat haven't returned and it was almost 11pm and  my dad left the other cat outside as well.

He continued to fight over it and followed me to the kitchen still fighting, I stopped talking at the moment that he insulted me and told him that I was done with the conversation and that I didn't care.

He went outside and found it and he came back all scratched but the cat seemed fine and after all the drama I checked on him and he is actually fine.

In the past years, as she got older, her consumption of alcohol and nicotine started taking a toll on her, physically and mentally. It is nothing major yet but she‘s changed. 
When i see her starting to drink in the early afternoon hours, my stomach turns. I am so worried for her health. And i told her that many, many, many times before. But she never got help and she will get really defensive telling me she “needs to do this in her own pace and i cannot force her” to change her consumption behavior. 

Anyway, i am currently visiting and it’s just the same as always. But on the weekend i had somewhat a panic attack after, again, being reminded that she is straight taking the route to self destruction. 

As a consequence i told her i would not join a four day short trip around the Christmas holidays with her and her husband (who also abuses alcohol) if there was alcohol involved. I told her i need that to keep my own sanity since i suffer seeing them doing what they do.

My mother got really angry and told me i won’t be welcome anymore on the trip. I am sad but it’s what i asked for: either the alcohol or me. So i am not fighting her decision. 

Now i am wondering if i asked too much. After all, on public holidays like this, you usually drink, no? And my mom is still functioning. She works, she takes care of her dog. She doesn’t mind the damage she is doing to herself. In other words, it is her life that she can live as she pleases.

My husband and I have been married for a few years.

I have never made it a point that I did not want a ring or formal proposal, in fact quite the opposite. I have said things about it more than a few times, and how it makes me feel to not have one. It makes me feel embarrassed when I am with my friends who have them or when they ask why I do not have one and it makes me feel sad when I see other people have a ring and grand proposal. I did not get a proposal and I feel like being upset about it is fair. Most women dream of having a proposal that means something, rather than just a hasty casual wedding. Whenever I bring up the ring, he tells me he’s working on it. For a while we had been in a situation where he could not afford it and it still made me sad but I understood. That is not the case now. I have thought about different scenarios where he would maybe come home and surprise me with one (holidays, birthdays, etc.) but it has never happened. Every time I bring it up, he says he working on it, wasn’t sure which ones I would like (we clarified this and still nothing), or has not had the opportunity to go.

My dad and mom divorced when I was 10. My dad started dating my stepmom when I was 16 and married her when I was 18. Without going into too much detail, my stepmom was mentally and verbally abusive to me from around the time we moved into their house (also when I was 18, a few weeks before their wedding). Two nights before their wedding, she and I got into a fight, and she threatened to cancel the wedding and throw me and my father out of the house. My father told me I had to apologize and take ownership for everything or she might not marry him. She would yell and scream in my face over any little thing, insult and shame me, badmouth my mother to me (who is in my life and helped raise me along with my dad), and demanded I treat her perfectly without giving me the slightest ounce of respect in return. She also kicked me out of the house a couple days before my 19th birthday, knowing I had no money or place to go at the moment. 

 It wasn’t until I met my now-fiancée at age 21, moved into an apartment with him, started working full time, and distanced myself from my immediate family that I finally got some peace. Even then, it was rare to go to dinner or any other family occasion with her present without her saying something snotty or insulting. She has also refused to apologize for anything or acknowledge any wrongdoing for anything, instead pinning all the blame back onto me.

I’m 30 now, and my fiancée and I are getting married soon. I have been NC with my stepmom for almost 2 years now. My dad and I have a rocky relationship—in part because he has always taken her side and defends her—but he and I have repaired some of our wounds. I have told him that he is invited to the wedding, as are my stepbrother and stepsister (I have no issues with them, and I don’t see a reason to not invite them), but that my stepmom is not. I told him everyone who is invited is somebody that my fiancée and I truly want there, and I do not want someone who was unapologetically abusive and cruel to me at my wedding. My father told me that he will not come if she is not invited, and that most of his side of the family will agree. He told me that by uninviting her, I am uninviting him as well—and that this just proves I don’t value having a relationship with him.

Ok so to start with I (F30) am a Widow of 3 years, my husband passed away in October 2019 something I still don’t think I’ve completely recovered and am not sure that I will. Now after my husband had passed in February of 2020 my family who are British Pakistani Muslims were encouraging me to get Remarried. My aunt had a colleague who was was a white British Revert to Islam and he had asked my aunt to spread his proposal around to people and she put forward his proposal to my parents and spoke highly of him and that he was a trustworthy person and my parents agreed to it. I personally was in no mental state to make any decisions since I was grieving I was essentially trying to focus on my work but other than that I was kind of just going wherever I was told to.

My family had me meet the guy twice in February only 5 months after my husbands passing but then lockdown hit which essentially stopped everything for that year. In early 2021 my mother got covid and almost passed away (was on the ventilator for 2 months) and couldn’t walk anymore it was an emotionally trying and devastating time for everyone involved. Once my mum came she told me she wanted to see me get married to that guy and everyone in my family and household started pressuring me to start seeing him again and had people telling me to just do what my mother says because her health is bad and she can’t take stress which I adhered to.

I began seeing the guy again after Ramadan in 2021 actually had a date with him on Eid day and I felt out of place but the man seemed nice enough and quite understanding towards the turmoil that was going on in my life through our discussions he was only really ever talking about marriage which I saw as a good thing and that he didn’t want to mess about. After a few months of sporadic meets In August I finally agreed to an engagement. Now once I did that a lot of red flags started popping up he started gearing conversations more towards sexual things asking preferences etc and telling me what he enjoyed aswell as pecking me on the lips 2 days before our engagement. Then the biggest red flag came once we actually got engaged, which was in the night Of our engagement around 1am he came to my hotel while everyone else had either gone home or was asleep and was keen on us having a physical relation there and then with his excuse being in Gods eyes we’re already married now and that the marriage ceremony is just for show.
So obviously this made everything feel very dubious for me it made me question if this guy was a con artist pretending to be Muslim?

I had eventually told my family a couple of weeks later and they essentially tried waving off what happened and wanted the marriage to continue which I then refuted and clashed with them over and ended things with the other guy and moved out of my parents and went no contact.

After 6 years of working I left the house to go to university and asked my mother if she could take care of Penny for me since I couldn't take her with me to live in the student halls. My mother agreed since Penny is very friendly and well trained and she loves dogs, plus I couldn't return home often because I was living 200 miles away from my hometown but I would send money to cover the cost of her food and vet appointments, which I did. After my first year studying the friend I used to live with sold her home and downsized which meant I could no longer rent a room after I had finished my degree. I was fine with this and wished her well. 

After completing my degree (3 years) I returned to my mother's home whilst I searched for a job. After around 6 months of living with my mother I found a job and an apartment nearby and started moving all of my furniture. When I was finally ready to move in I drove over to my mother's house to pick Penny up and take her with me but my brother (25)stopped me. He complained that it isn't fair to take her away because for the past 3 years himself and his girlfriend have been taking care of her and they have bonded with her and don't want her to leave (they both live with my mother). I argued that I asked our mother to take care of her and didn't ever ask him for any help.

 It ended with a huge blow out because I eventually took Penny with me to my apartment. Now my brother refuses to speak to me and has blocked my number after sending me a couple of messages calling me an asshole and his girlfriends mother (I've never met her mother or even had a conversation with her) is messaging me on social media calling me disgusting.

He (21M) decided to dm me (24F). We had similar interests and sense of humor. We shared one class together which definitely took me by surprise as he’s a comm major and I’m a child development major but it’s a class for both. We went on a couple of dates. He wasn’t looking for a relationship and neither was I. He was quite close to me and very affectionate towards me. He called me honey, baby, sweetie and had slept over a few times. We would walk together and he’d drop me off at the university library as I often study there. 

He stopped hanging out with me, claiming he had mono and unable to kiss me despite the fact he kept seeing other girls and sending me snaps where he was in another girl’s room. He stopped showing up to our shared class and spent more time at his parents house than at his apartment. 

He was still texting me and sent snaps to each other on a daily basis. He told me to just be confident. He would get jealous if I looked at another man. He was quite annoyed with what I did. He even said it won’t get me a boyfriend after I posted (then deleted) a meme about making fun of alpha male/manosphere. He compared me to other girls and even suggested I should go to the gym and do squats to get a bigger butt. By that logic he should lose weight since he’s not exactly in shape either. During a snap streak he broke the news that he was talking to another girl and it was getting serious. I was quite surprised since he talked at length about how he doesn’t like getting into relationships because he was in a toxic online relationship with some girl who made his life a living hell. I was upset as it confirmed my gut feeling the past month. He got upset and began to insult and belittle me over my “feelings” for calling him out on his inconsistency. I was angry that he didn’t tell me in person or gave me a call. I went to my friend's house during the fight. They revealed a lot about him since my former roommate’s new roommate is his coworker and how he’s actually not very confident himself, unpopular with his coworkers and the kids they help out and constantly fucks up at work. They also mentioned how he gave them the “can I have a hug” type guys you might see back in high school. Idk what I saw in him but he was the most seemingly normal guy I’ve met. A new female coworker had a birthday party and invited all of her coworkers except for him since he apparently gave her the creeps by trying to hug her. I blocked him on my ig but was still fighting over Snapchat. He was PISSED that I now know this side of him. While he was typing all this crazy shit to me, I blocked him as he was pathetic and not the guy I thought he was.

The night was fun &amp; splendid. I met a guy (19yr male) who had an intriguing persona, was well spoken &amp; seemed overall endearing. 

We talked about literature which we are both fond of. Our conversation flowed and he invited me to come indoors as we were sitting outside with his &amp; my friends. He insisted that i get a last drink with him and i didn’t mind as he paid.

Before the drink arrived, i excused myself to go to the bathroom &amp; when i came back my gin &amp; tonic was there along side his red wine.

I was about to drink until i realised that the ice had surrounding bubbles which i haven’t seen before &amp; i am an extremely sceptical so i thought my drink might have been drugged by him so i asked if we could swap drinks as preferred red wine now as it helps me sleep better because i intended to go home soon.

He was hesitant at first but agreed and i saw him intensely looking at the drink and then started drinking. After being quite frightened for a while, he started to inform me that he felt sick and dizzy and became unconscious. I was in complete shock because i thought i was speculating. The bar owner called the ambulance and i started overthinking that it wasn’t him. 

It came to light that he had been drugged and i informed them that i didn’t put anything in the drink. Whilst the ambulance was there, two more other girls in the bar fell unconscious. 

A man who spoke to both of them was arrested under suspicious behaviour. It came to light that he did drugged them and tried to drug me whilst the drinks were at the bar. I feel encapsulated with guilt.

They’re new to the area and don’t know anyone else here. Wife just told me this morning and the dogs were coming tonight. She probably didn’t mention it because she knew I would push back. Or she just didn’t even consider the ramifications of what she was volunteering to do, which could also explain it. Probably some of both. 

She knows I don’t like dogs (sorry internet). I immediately thought of all the ways this is going to be inconvenient. These are large dogs and apparently they sleep inside. If they were outside dogs, this might be a non-issue. But she didn’t ask them that ahead of time.

We’ve been married for over 15 years and have some kids. We finally decided last year to get our first nice living room furniture. We have some nice things now that our kids are old enough that they don’t destroy everything. The first thing the dogs did when they got to our house was jump on our couch. Also, it turns out that we’re watching them for a week. I don’t think she actually asked how long and just figured it out tonight. 

I’ve been seething all evening. Pretty sure she picked up. So after getting ready for bed, she came into the bedroom and I said, “so what are the dogs going to do? We can’t sleep with the door closed. They’re going to wake up at some point and not know what to do.” She said, “we can sleep with the door open, or I can sleep on the couch. Which do you prefer?”  After not much of a response from me, she said “I screwed up. I should have gotten more details and I should have talked to you first.” I just didn’t say anything. She’s right. I definitely would have made her get more details because that’s how I operate. She just saw an opportunity to help a friend and didn’t think past that. It’s admirable, but I think sometimes it can be to a fault. 

Shortly thereafter the dogs were awake and walking around our room. One jumped on the bed, which didn’t make me happy. My wife eventually got the dogs out of the room and closed the door. It looks like she’s going to sleep in the living room with the dogs. And I didn’t stop her.

I was returning to my dorm room with my hands full of paper and I wasn't exactly paying attention to what was going on.

Since I had my hands full I kicked the door open like my roommate normally does.

What I didn't expect was my roommate standing behind the door for no reason (he might be trying to admire himself in the mirror but idk). He was also barefooted because he would never go shopping to buy himself a pair of sandals or something or wear indoors.

As a result his toe was devastated by the door, his toe looks somewhat purple and is bleeding, though not very severely.

I got him a band-aid and asked for help, but my roommate keeps on blaming me for hurting him, and he keeps asking questions like why would I open the door with my foot, or why I had my hands full.

I don't really know what to say since he is usually the one that kicks the door open with all his strength even when his hands are free.

Besides all that he ain't the best roommate. I've been doing the cleaning for the past month or two because he keeps making excuses like ""I don't know how to use a vaccum cleaner"", or ""I already did my part earlier."" He also never cleans up trash and leaves empty noodle cups and now the room smells like shit.

So just keep in mind I am trying my best


So here’s some background me (F 15) and my friend (F 15), let’s call her Jackie.
So me and Jackie have been friends for a while, and we met through a mutual friend when we were like 7. Jackie is VERY loud and has many friends, compared to me, even though I am quite sociable I literally only have 3 close friends. 

Onto the main topic, I have been interested in basketball since grade 6 and so has Jackie but I’ve only ever played on school teams ( never in actual games). Jackie is wayyy better than me at almost everything, and she joins sports teams and makes friends and just has a great time. This year I was thinking about joining an out of school team, and so was Jackie. the main reason I decided to join was because she was going to be there to mentor me, because I haven’t been to any sports tryouts ever and have really bad anxiety (Jackie knows this). 
Now here’s where it all starts to go downhill, Jackie decides to invite a girl from our school named Marla to tryout too. Now Marla is OBSESSED with sports and I’m not even going to lie she’s really good. But the thing is I’m pretty sure Jackie never mentioned that I was joining too, so when I heard Jackie talking to Marla i heard that Marla was saying that “she wouldn’t be able to actually join, but she’s trying out to prove that she’s good enough and support Jackie”.
Now idk if that’s just me but like that seems pretentious yk? 

Anyways my family has always been pretty poor and we never have a car, so the plan was that I would go with Jackie to tryouts. But then a couple of days before tryouts I found out that jackie was going to go to tryouts with Marla in  her car and Jackie was going to ask if she could drive me too, sooo turns out she said no she can’t drive me but I literally can’t think of a reason why not?? (her family is like super rich) so then I have to ask my uncle to drive me, and I kinda feel left in the dust and I’m freaking out a little. Even though I haven’t said anything about it yet to Jackie, I probably won’t even, cause things like this have happened before and she just tells me “you’re literally so clingy, why can’t I just have other friends”

During this time, I have constantly been handling the things he cannot (for whatever reason) and he has done the same for me. This has worked out very well for our dynamic. That being said, I handle most things: money, kids, schedules, etc. and that is completely fine because I enjoy doing those things and it is not much of a hassle for me.

He has been out of work on disability for 2 months now and we have yet to recieve a single disability payment because of the process it takes to get it approved and his unwillingness to speak to doctors, even schedule appointments. I have made very phone call and filled out every document so far in the process.

Recently, my health took a turn for the worse and we scheduled a necessary surgery, expecting a long and terrible recovery process. Before the surgery, I told him I would not be able to handle all of the things that I have been handling and made him a list of the things I needed him to take care of, making sure to communicate specifics and deadlines in the process (writing everything out so he would not have to rely on memory, which is one of his concerns). He promised he would handle these things.

Now, he didn't necessarily lie to me and say he did the things that he didn't, but he gave the impression that he had taken care of these things because he was spending the time he had to take care of them (business hours) playing video games. Deadlines have come and passed with no communication on his part that the items were not taken care of and now I don't even know if we are going to receive any money for the time he has spent out of work.

I told him this was unacceptable and he said I was expecting too much from him and not taking into account his anxiety over phone calls, paperwork, etc. But he didn't communicate he was going to have problem with any of it. If he did, we could have figured something out beforehand to make the strain lesser, but he didn't.

We hit it off immediately and were hanging out multiple nights a week and even consecutive days. In the beginning he was putting in effort and wanting to take me on dates, was calling me every night, and said this could be something serious.

The issue that quickly came up was that he doesn’t listen or remember anything I tell him about myself. I told him I feel worse when we talk on the phone bc he’s completely silent when I’m telling him things about me and my day and I feel like I’m talking to a wall. Later he would ask me questions that made it clear he wasn’t listening at all and forgot everything (i.e. asking about my mom I had already told him passed away several times). The other day I was telling him about how I needed to go into my office and everything that was going on, he seemed engaged then when he was dropping me off forgot all about it and went to my apartment. When I reminded him he said he “messed up” then turned around and dropped me off on the side of the road and I ended up walking 20 min (it was a 3 min drive from there) and was 30 min late to work so he wouldn’t be a few minutes late to his haircut.

I was sitting with 2 others S (F28) and P (F29). At some point in the evening after a couple of wines (keep in mind we're all pretty open) S and P were chatting a guy that S was seeing. S said that she had broken things off as she felt like she couldn't trust this guy because after they had been intimate together he disclosed that he had genital herpes type 1. 

I said to her I'm sorry that she had been told about this and that it's important for disclosure so people can make up their own mind, particularly when it's something that can spread even when using protection and when there isn't a breakout even though it's a small chance. 

After this I said that although I wasn't defending his actions I imagined it must be difficult because there is such a stigma in society with genital herpes and coldsores (oral herpes). Where many people don't bat an eyelid with coldsores yet genital herpes seemed to be viewed differently. 

S said yea but they're completely different things. I said well they're not, while there are 2 hsv variations that can cause genital/oral herpes you can get types 1 oral or genital and hsv 2 genital and sometimes oral (although much more rare). 

S looked at me weirdly and asked me what I meant and why I was bringing up coldsores they've got nothing to do with this. Basically everyone gets coldsores but that's got nothing to do with genital herpes, this guy didn't tell me about his STI. P chirped in and said yea I get coldsores and then S said me too. 

I said ""yes I get it, you're correct most people do have oral herpes which are coldsores, coldsores=herpes, the same virus can also cause genital herpes. There is a misconception that only HSV 2 causes genital herpes but this is incorrect if you were to have oral sex you can give someone genital herpes even if you just get coldsores.""

I then said that it's shit that this guy didn't disclose but did you tell him you get coldsores before being initimate. S said ""no who tells people that, obviously I wouldn't kiss someone while I had one"". 

I said"" fair enough but that's probably exactly what this guy was thinking. He wasn't having an outbreak therefore the chance of passing on was very low (not 0 though) so he didn't disclose"". 

I said ""anyone who get's coldsores is capable of passing it on as genital herpes if you engage in oral sex. So it sees unfair to have double standards. I mean you could give someone genital herpes"". 

After this S just said yea I guess so, and P and S went to get more drinks and sat away from me from the rest pf the night.

We have known each other since very young and began a relationship a few years back. We dated for a few years and he finally proposed and we were married shortly after. 

Prior to our engagement our relationship was put to the test more often than I could’ve ever imagined. Not even two months after our wedding I find out he cheated on me with someone I asked him to stay away from if he wished to continue our relationship. 

I didn’t know what to do then. I was devastated and all I could think of that day was to numb the pain inside me and I drank the night away and probably cried a lot and took things off my chest—- that’s what he says. 

It’s been almost two years since I found out and two very long years of working on our relationship and regaining the trust bc I was very much in love; I still love him. 

Since that day, I have not been the same. I have made a lot of progress but I have my days. And lately, the connection is a bit off and I keep bringing up the fact that he cheated on me over and over and over again. 
Sometime I do say mean things that I later regret and I feel dumb because I know being spiteful won’t help either of us. I know that it has been painful for us both but I feel broken inside and I wish I could make him feel my pain sometimes, despite knowing he is sorry. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I love him still but it’s just not the same once the trust has been broken.

 of course i was like wtf so i took her back to my apartment and she told me everything and i let her lay down and got her whatever she needed and kind of let her get it out and cry and everything. 

then i called her brother (my bf) to come home ASAP (we live tg), and when we got there she told/shows him and he did chuckle but like in disbelief, but then she was crying harder so he told her that we’d figure it out don’t worry it’s not that bad. 

and so i pulled him aside and asked about thanksgiving because it’s coming up and she def won’t wanna go. he said that he didn’t think it’s a big deal and she can just wear a mask or something. but his family (specifically dads side) is very anti-mask/anti-covid whatever. 

and so i’m like cant she just not go, i will stay with her. but he said no and that everything will be fine because his family really does take the holidays very seriously and if anything goes even a little wrong it’s like the world is freaking on fire. 

so i TELL him basically i will stay back with his sis because she doesn’t feel comfortable and why should she have to. he told me i can do what i want but it won’t be a good idea because then his family will create drama about me and stuff and resent me for like keeping sis away from the family/not coming. 

fast forward i called his mom and told her what’s up. (their mom and dad thought that she just suddenly spent the night at her brothers) she then came over and saw for herself and was like jesus. i said we could stay back because she doesn’t want to go, and ofc she said that would be an uproar but the dad would never go for the mask either. she said she would bring it up to the dad anyways. 

so she told the dad what happened and that sis is not comfortable going so i will not be attending as well as sis, and now he’s saying i’m trying to break apart his family and i’m disrespecting him and i’m manipulative and i’m holding sis hostage and all this bs yk. the whole family hates me now because of him and his influence. from what i know the mom is trying to reason w him (my bf and her are on my side), but sis is still staying with me and her brother.

I grabbed the lotion from his bed side table and sat straddling his back and started trying to get the lotion out. He told me stop don’t use it and I was like “uh, I always use lotion, it makes it easier to rub?” The bottl had a broken pump so I untwist the pump and use the stick to distribute it. He started flinching and reacting to the cold (again pretty typical) but he kept telling me to stop but I thought it was funny. No lotion was coming out so I shook the open bottle and lotion went all over his back. He. Flipped. Told me to get off, he told me to stop, that it was disgusting, he’s so annoyed and angry. I kept laughing but soon realized he wasn’t joking. I went to the bathroom to grab a towel and when I came back, he was sleeping w his back turned towards me and the covers all on him. I tried to pull back but he not having it. I tried to tell him goodnight, apologize, and give him a kiss but he rejected me and told me to go to bed because he was tired. 

To get angry is really unlike him and now I am annoyed because dude get over it, it’s LOTION.

 of course i was like wtf so i took her back to my apartment and she told me everything and i let her lay down and got her whatever she needed and kind of let her get it out and cry and everything. 

then i called her brother (my bf) to come home ASAP (we live tg), and when we got there she told/shows him and he did chuckle but like in disbelief, but then she was crying harder so he told her that we’d figure it out don’t worry it’s not that bad. 

and so i pulled him aside and asked about thanksgiving because it’s coming up and she def won’t wanna go. he said that he didn’t think it’s a big deal and she can just wear a mask or something. but his family (specifically dads side) is very anti-mask/anti-covid whatever. 

and so i’m like cant she just not go, i will stay with her. but he said no and that everything will be fine because his family really does take the holidays very seriously and if anything goes even a little wrong it’s like the world is freaking on fire. 

so i TELL him basically i will stay back with his sis because she doesn’t feel comfortable and why should she have to. he told me i can do what i want but it won’t be a good idea because then his family will create drama about me and stuff and resent me for like keeping sis away from the family/not coming. 

fast forward i called his mom and told her what’s up. (their mom and dad thought that she just suddenly spent the night at her brothers) she then came over and saw for herself and was like jesus. i said we could stay back because she doesn’t want to go, and ofc she said that would be an uproar but the dad would never go for the mask either. she said she would bring it up to the dad anyways. 

so she told the dad what happened and that sis is not comfortable going so i will not be attending as well as sis, and now he’s saying i’m trying to break apart his family and i’m disrespecting him and i’m manipulative and 
i’m holding sis hostage and all this bs yk. the whole family hates me now because of him and his influence. from what i know the mom is trying to reason w him (my bf and her are on my side), but sis is still staying with me and her brother. 

now im starting to think i’ve done more harm than good and i’ve broken the family apart and i’m kind of scared",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4814556,public,top,self,AITA for planning to not attend bfs family’s holidays in support of his little sis and her bad nose job?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1m63i/aita_for_planning_to_not_attend_bfs_familys/,all_ads,6,,,,
