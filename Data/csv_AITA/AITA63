I don't like cars/driving, but my partner loves it and hates public transport, so when we go somewhere usually it's by car, with him on the wheel. I'm generally grateful, even though I don't mind public transport, we live in a city and while it isn't as quick as a car, I get by without driving just fine.

That said, there were a few instances where I felt really unsafe with him:

1. A few months ago we went to a concert without dedicated parking for the venue and the small streets around were very busy. Eventually some guy was leaving his spot and so my partner waited for the lot to be free. In the meantime a bigger car decided to join us in this endeavour and the situation - I struggle to remember the details - was that the guy was honking at us to move cause he wanted the spot for himself, we were unable to take the spot but my partner refused to move the car und eventually got out and walked towards the competitor. They talked briefly, but I don't know what was said.  
He did not talk to me about what he wanted to do, so I just got really anxious and later pleaded with him (I never left our car) to leave and find another spot - this was turning into more drama than we bargained for.   
He still is of the opinion that he could not let this guy ""walk all over him"" and he wanted to tell him that he was first and entitled to this spot.
2. Today we were on our way home from shopping. To get home we have to take a left into a street that always has cars parked on both sides, which reduce the space to one lane only. We took the turn and stopped on the corner just before the parking cars, because an SUV was facing us, blocking the width between the parked cars. The driver was blinking and appeared to be looking for a parking spot.  
After waiting a few minutes and hoping for movement, while cars behind the SUV were piling up, my partner hit the gas and drove straight towards the SUV to stop in front of it.  
A passing dude talked to the SUV-driver and then me to get us to move back - I'm pretty sure me asking him to move would have not helped, but I didn't get time to - and he moved back toward the spot by the crossing. The SUV then parked and we waited out the cars in the other direction.  
My partner apologized to me immediately after.

Here's where I may or may not be the asshole:

At home, I suggested anger management classes and said if this sort of thing happens one more time, I'm not getting into the car with him again.

My reasoning is this:

He apologizes because he thinks I'm sensitive/anxious, not because it's wrong or dangerous, he's convinced he's justified. Since he doesn't see an issue with his rage, it'll keep happening, so I need to make it a big enough problem for him to learn how to not rage.

He's mad at me for setting what he calls an ultimatum and says it's selfish of me to protect myself this way.

All three of us are very good friends and Paul has respected our relationship, it seemed. It all started this past August when he first saw me after summer break. We both go to a “private school” where our moms work in the office. It’s not uncommon to see each other occasionally throughout the summer, because we go with our moms to work. The first few times he saw me, his body language had awkward written all over it. He’s already socially awkward, but it was worse than usual. We’ve always been comfortable around each other, but it felt like the atmosphere changed all of a sudden. Red flag.

Fast forward a few weeks, things settle down and we’re becoming better friends by the day. All three of us: Paul, my boyfriend, and I are playing games every day and everything is going smoothly. Until one day he says something really out of line. He started making jokes about how he has sexual fantasies about me. A few minutes later he made jokes, alluding to me sucking the cheese off of his dick. And then to top it off, he started saying how he calls me mommy??? He said all of things in front of my boyfriend, keep in mind. We were both in shock. It isn’t uncommon for my boyfriend and Paul to make sexual jokes towards each other, and I jokingly act jealous about it. But we’ve never made sexual jokes about Paul and me, nor have I ever intentionally (or ever) flirted with Paul. My boyfriend and I just brushed off the jokes and hoped we didn’t have to broach it again, but we did. 

We went to cookout with Paul and a few other friends about a week after he made those inappropriate jokes. He brought up, just to me, about how he was going to make me suck the cheese off of his dick later that night. So I started telling everyone right then and there everything he had said to me. He got really embarrassed and stopped talking. The conversation started to go quiet and the night ended with me and my boyfriend abruptly leaving. Paul and I haven’t really talked about the situation since, and he’s just acting like it never happened. When I tried to bring it up the other day he started to get upset and embarrassed and I felt ashamed and apologized to him.

I feel like I shouldn’t be the one in the wrong. I’m thinking I handled the situation poorly and should’ve gone a better route that didn’t make him feel bad.

My niece was given power of attorney by my parents, who are in the 90s.
Since she got power of attorney she has abusing that authority.
She had my parents move to CT from SC.
She acted as the broker for the sale of their house (she has zero experience with real estate).
She set up a rental for my parents that was (a) not appropriate the handicap and was for one year ( it’s illegal in CT to pay a years rent in advance) I advised against it. In less than a year she put them into an assisted living facility and never tried to break the least costing my parents 4K for each unused month.
She helped herself to my mothers silver, which my mother demanded be returned. My niece still has it. 
She colluded with my father to lie to my mother about moving them to assisted living.
My mother was so upset and depressed she told me she wanted to die.
She took my fathers new iPad and gave it to her son (aged 5).  She deleted family members (that my father communicated with).
She disabled my fathers access to Amazon (I send them whatever they want or need). 
She has the facility open all their mail and packages. My parents were angry over it so I reported this to the state and facility stopped the practice.
My niece advised the facility that I have no right to ask them about my parents and to talk to them. 
I again reported the issue to the state and it was resolved.
I found out that she is lying to my parents about the cost of the facility, she told them it’s 1/2 of what it actually is.
She is refusing to contact the VA to get my fathers VA health benefits.. and having him pay out of pocket.
There are that wandering into and out of their rooms, there are thefts occurring and nothing is done, I again complained to the state and the facility was investigated.
Now my niece is saying how overwhelmed and busy she is to take care of moving my parents to a facility closer to her and my sister. 
She doesn’t work has 3 kids (2 of which are on private day care at over 5k a semester.
She plays the victim and is a drama queen.
She barely visits my parents and they are alone at every holiday.
She refuses to pay for things my father wants and they fought over a wheelchair.
She just had my father take a competency test over a 400.00 silver baby cup I bought on his behalf as a baby gift for her. (I am a widow and that was more than I could give).

My girlfriend and I recently found out we are expecting, and that she’s about 7 weeks into her pregnancy. She already has a 18 month old who isn’t mine but I consider to be mine. Now is where the issue begins. I work a part time job where my shifts range from 9 AM-6:30 PM to 12PM-6:30 PM. On the days I go in at 9 I get a 30 minute lunch break. With the time I have off I try to do as much as I can to help her out at home. I take our dogs out and feed them, I do the dishes or help her clean, I do laundry, and I help with her son. On my lunch breaks I wake her son up for the day, bathe him, and feed him. Most of the the time I don’t even get to eat. After work I watch her son and the dogs so she can sleep or relax. Among other things. Ever since we found out she’s pregnant she’s been asking me to stay home when she is feeling the symptoms (nausea, cramps, fatigue, etc.) I started calling in to work multiple times a week. Either asking for a longer lunch, asking to come in later in the day when another coworker’s shift is finished, or asking for the whole day off in total. After doing it frequently my manager wrote me up and informed me that if I kept calling in or showing up late that I would be fired. My paychecks pay almost the entirety of our bills so I can’t afford to lose this job. Today she woke up in a lot of pain and asked me to call in to stay with her. I told her I can give her Tylenol and if she absolutely needs help that she should call her grandmother who usually helps with her son when we are both busy. Knowing that I’ve been written up and threatened with my job, she gets angry with me and tells me that if work is always going to be more important than her and if she’s never going to get any help, she’ll move in with her grandmother and we need to reconsider our relationship.

Me and my partner both worked together and from what I gathered we both were worried about the repercussions at work hence why neither of us made a move before. We dated until my son was about 2m/o and everything seemed to be going fine until about the week or so before he broke up with me. 

He set off for a holiday with his family for about a fortnight and everything seemed to be fine at first, he let me know when he was there and sent a few updates of what they were up to and how much fun they were having. It was my birthday whilst he was away and his family sent me a gift (I mention this because I can't understand why if they had any clue about us being about to break up they would, so I think maybe they didn't know?). About a week into the trip contact became less and I was starting to feel like something was off. I asked him if everything was okay and at that time he said it was. 

Fast forward to him arriving home. The first day I saw him after he got home I was nervous because I couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong but looking forward to seeing him. The for the first little while he doesn't mention anything of the sort and then eventually he asks to remove the romantic element of our relationship for the time being. I said that if we weren't romantically involved I didn't want to be friends, not out of spite, but because I don't want the person I wanted to be in a lasting relationship with as a friend and a constant reminder that they didn't feel the same way for me that I felt for them. This sort of threw a spanner in the works for his plan and many choice comments were made such as the old if we're both single in four years kinda thing, which he later apologised for. He eventually told me he had a gut feeling he should break up with me and then left. 

Fast forward again to a little later and I'm still confused and hurt as to what even happened so I message him asking him just to talk about it. He essentially said that he felt he couldn't have ""meaningful relationships"" at uni (he was starting that September) whilst in a relationship with me and that was his closure. 

Bare in mind this is the guy who said he wanted to be a father-like figure to my son, he wanted to go on holidays with me in the future, we talked about a future that never became. 

His whole attitude feels as if he feels it's no harm no foul, but I feel differently, I'm angry and hurt, I feel like it is wrong, he talked about a future with me that he never planned on following through, he told me he loved me, and he gave me hope we could make it last when I didn't believe just to let me down. I don't feel like his reasoning tracks unless he wants to essentially date/have sex with other people at his uni but then why say all those things to me? (And it's not sex because we didn't even have sex)

It made financial sense at the time). He is a single father to 15yo Amber. Amber is a good kid, but very spoiled. We do get along, though. I do not have kids, if that matters.

Next, Ryan works 2 jobs. He has done this for 20 years, but not out of necessity- I don't understand either. So he's not home a whole lot for the majority of the week. Due to this, the family has to work together to get Amber to and from school and wherever else she needs to go (we live out in the sticks). Cool. Not a huge deal, I can help with that. I've taken her to and from school, friends house's, extracurriculars, even took her dress shopping for homecoming. But right now, I am trying to prepare for a certification exam, which is tomorrow. Due to this, I have had to say no to giving her a ride exactly 2 times, one of them being today. However, it did not start out that way. Amber told us a few days ago that she needed a ride to an ROTC fundraiser they are having tonight at a restaurant at about 1730. Her uncle usually brings her home on his way from work around 1530, the restaurant is about 20 min from the house, so I can wait until around 1700 to leave. Not a big deal, I can do that. Then the day before yesterday, asks me if I can pick up her bf along the way. Eh, I'd rather not. But it's only 10-15 more min. Finally, yesterday, she texts, asking if I can pick her up from her aunt's at 1530, then pick up the bf, bring them home, then wait around until 1700, and take them to the restaurant. As I said before, I have an exam tomorrow. My final exam. I do not feel like playing taxi today. To add to this, she is throwing a fit bc I don't want to let her drive my car. She doesn't even have a permit! I also just got a new transmission, but I digress. 

&amp;#x200B;

I voice my concerns to Ryan, telling him I don't appreciate how she's treating me like a taxi and keeps changing plans on me. If I agree to this, it is going to take roughly 2 hrs of my time-this includes the waiting around. It takes me awhile to get into the groove of studying, so there wouldn't be any point while waiting- vs 30 min at most. I tell him she won't drop wanting to drive the car, and ask ""does she ever stop?"" He calls me a selfish AH and basically says I never help him with her. Y'all, I snapped. I tell him she is not my responsibility; I have more important things to tend to today. Either I do what I agreed to, or she can find another way to get there. This did not go over well.

Something happened last week that just made me want to tell her to shut up, and I never get mad at my friends like this. She cursed out our server and i felt so awful for the server and having to be around that, and even worried about how she was going to act in the car when we left. In the car she couldn’t stop talking about how bad the service was and kept rolling down her windows to yell at people while we were in my car and i kept telling her to stop but she just wouldn’t calm down. 
She’s cursed out my neighbor, servers, people on the street and many people out at bars, but never me.

The simplest things make her mad- someone not having the right facial expression can send her on an hour long rant which I will have to listen to or try to calm her down by constantly having to be the happy or joking friend. Other people (including myself) would just laugh or shrug off the things that set her off. Something small like the bartender taking a while to make our drinks or having to park far away will send her over the top. It’s getting to the point where I literally feel unsafe going out with her and even having her over to my house because of how unhinged she is. She will swear up a storm and every time we hang out she comes in to the car or into my house pissed off, which means I have to either listen to her yell or calm her down which is a lot for me and I wish she could just get control of her anger. It’s not even just when we hang out, she is constantly texting me about very small things that make her unreasonably upset, it’s actually scary. We don’t live in the nicest part of town, and i’m worried that one day she will say something too loud and be aggressive to the wrong person, I’ve told her this and she claims she doesn’t care because she’ll “fight them”. I don’t know if she realizes how much this affects me but it’s getting to be too much and it’s hard to hang out with her. She is my only friend in town right now (Ive only lived here for a couple years and work from home) and we have been friends for a while she is a great person otherwise but this is really bringing me down. I would try talking to her but she has other issues and it feels like if i left she might do something drastic.

Over thanksgiving weekend, my college aged son was home with his girlfriend staying with us (I’ll call them David and Molly). On Saturday afternoon my husband and I went with our other son (Sam) to run errands while David and Molly stayed home. When we got home David and Molly were gone, and my husband, Sam and I went to the basement to watch a movie. 

After about 5 minutes, my husband and Sam noticed that “it smells good down here” and asked if anything was different. I said I didn’t think so - we didn’t have any food down there or anything, so it was unclear what it was. 

When my husband got up to use the bathroom I noticed something lodged in the couch cushion between us - a pair of women’s underwear. I was shocked/annoyed/amused, clearly they were Molly’s. I quickly stuffed them in the pocket of my pants before he got back and said nothing. 

After the movie we were upstairs in our room and my husband was extremely frisky, ravenous even. Sorry if TMI, but he dropped to his knees and kissed my tummy area etc., just very carnal. Meanwhile I had the undies in my pocket still! I quickly excused myself to the bathroom and got rid of my pants and the “goods”, I felt like an accomplice or something at this point. (Yes, it was clear that the undies were the source of this scent in the basement.)

I f(17) have a neighbor f(49?) who can't get kids. She doesn't have a partner and lives with her parents. All fine, no problems. Last year she got her first dogs. Both had some kind of problems. One had a heart disease and the other one spinal problems. Also fine. 

But then something weird happened. She started treating those dogs like kids. Means, she pushed them around in strollers, had them sitting in baby chairs and put baby clothing on them. I wasn't sure if this already counts as animal abuse. She also doesn't go on walk with them, just keeps them in her garden for a few minutes once or twice everyday.

I am pretty sure that that's not the way you keep dogs. Last month, both sadly passed away and she got two new dogs. Same breed, but perfectly healthy this time. She did multiple vet checks and there never was a problem. Until last week, she told me that the younger one can't eat meat anymore and now she only feeds him salad and oak milk with cereals. Yes, normal cereals. For a dog! And her other dog apparently has a problem with his leg which is the reason she totally wrapped him into a stroller-like-device. Keeping him inside all day long.

There was my problem. Both of the dogs are completely healthy and all out of sudden, both have some kind of sickness. She never went outside with them, feeding them human food, including cookies, chocolate, tea, cheese, etc. and she kept pushing them around in stroller, not treating them like dogs, but like children.

After a while, I didn't saw them outside, ever! But I often saw them sitting in front of the door, scratching the glass, howling, etc. So I called the authorities on her for animal abuse. I didn't know what exactly happened, but the people came out with her dogs. She was crying and begging them not to take them. I haven't seen or heard from her since. 

I only know that her dogs where brought to a shelter and she isn't allowed to have dogs again, because of animal abuse. Turning out that she had multiple reports of animal abuse in her past.

So some background info: My wife and I have been together for 6 years (Dating for 4, married for 2) During our relationship there was one thing we would always do, We would take her Dog on a walk with her Friend (Lets call her Jen) and her Dog, and then we would take her to work or get her groceries.

We have been doing this most weekends for the 6 years we have been together, Till about a few months ago. A few months after my wife and I go married she got pregnant, everything went well, and we had a son, and that's when it started. She would bad mouth my parenting skills.

One day during this summer I hit my braking point. Jen and my wife went to a Show in a city 2 hours away from where we live,  I  looked  after my son for the whole day on my own for the first time ever, needless to say I was really worried, but I had the support of my Family to help.

the next weekend when we were out on our Walk, I was talking about how great everything went with my son, He didn't fuss to much like he usually would and how he actually fell asleep on me for the first time in months Not for a lack of trying, but he prefers his mum over me (Understandable as she breast feed and he  refused to be bottle fed)

I was sharing this feeling of pride and that I finally felt good about my abilities as a father when she decided to make a sarcastic remark.

As I was talking about what happened that day and all that went on with my son, Jen Pipped up with a sarcastic remark of ""Yeah You 'parented'"" (Yes she used finger quotes)

This hurt a lot and for the first time I responded to her remarks of my Parenting.

I turned to her and my tone changed immediately. I replied back ""Wow that was C---y"" she was taken aback. I continued ""that is F--ing rude to say when you have never been a parent, You have no right to say S#!t""

She got really angry and responded ""Wow F--k you OP"" and walked away.

My wife was stunned by what I said, and said to me ""That wasn't really the right way to deal with that""

I shrugged my shoulders and told her I'd walk home, and that she should catch up to Jen and giver her that lift to get her groceries.

I have not joined them on a walk since.

Jen still maintains she said nothing wrong and refuses to apologies, I maintain that while what I said was rude that I wasn't wrong for saying it after being critiqued and Belittled about my parenting as a first time Father.

I get kind of a mixed reaction when I tell this story to others, So people of Reddit,

My boss has cameras in her classroom and parents can access them anytime to see their children learning, playing or just behaving in general. One day, my boss was struggling because of one student who kept acting up. She lost control and angrily screamed at the whole class. Then she slammed the table. She then took a minute to cool off but didn’t leave the room or anything (she didn’t call me to cover or watch them). Some parents were watching while this all unfoldes and so far a few children have been pulled from the facility: some bc the parents saw, some because the children left crying and complained, some bc they heard about it later.

My boss told me (just chatting, not in any tone) and I politely reminded her that a lot of parents in that group use gentle parenting so they would never tolerate this. I just tried to make her see why kids were being pulled. I try to use gentle teaching too (I learn everyday though) and suggested that she should apologize and speak to both parents and kids, even if that won’t make them return. She said she might and I left it at that. 

I told some friends/family about it and some said it was aholey to tell her how to do her job because she is experiences. But she asked for my opinion. What do you think? AITA? Should I have done anything different?

Have been together for a year and a half now.  But we were first friends and tried dating a couple times but timing or communication wasn't right. 

We have moved in together now. Talked through a lot of the past issues we had and talk regularly about current issues.  We have become very open with each other and both agree that our communication is fabulous .

He goes to therapy a couple of times a month and it's over all been really helpful to him to have an outsider as a sounding board for his issues 

I tried therapy a few times. But find that I can ultimately just talk to friends/family as a sounding board and it has the same effect of just getting me to talk through my feelings. 


He wants to spend his life with me and I want to get married but he is quite terrified of divorce and seeing it as a failure and his therapist suggested and Recommended a couple's therapist.

But when he came to me and said he wanted to go to therapy together in order to feel like getting married I got really upset and said I wouldn't go. 

From my point of view we have actively been working on and focusing on conversation and he is just beginning to really trust me with his emotions and thoughts and It feels like going to therapy with him is taking a step back -- that we need a third person to have important conversations and can't he just talk to me like we have been doing.    And the getting married /proposal shouldn't be like a box that he checks off but instead a feeling he has 

From his perspective it is a thing that all couples should just do in order to get closer and he thinks it could lead conversations into places we haven't thought about yet -- get him more ready. 

Ultimately I feel like he will have to come to a point where wanting to get married means more then the fear of divorce.

I 28f have never met this woman in person, she’s about 32 and I’ll call her Betty.. This all started a few months ago when I first had my fiancé 29m meet my kids. My son had a diaper rash on his bum and acted very strangely around my fiancé so I asked him outright if he was a creep and told him to leave immediately. I took my son to the er and they said he just had a rash and was behaving strangely likely because he was being introduced to a new person. Well, because of my childhood where I wasn’t protected from this very thing I wasn’t taking any chances. And I don’t regret making sure he was safe over hurting anyone’s feelings. 
Fast forward and me and my fiancé have talked about this and we worked it out, but he had told his family about the accusation before we had talked. They were of course protective of him but the rest of his family moved past it and understood that I was just being a good mom and making sure my baby was safe.
Well, I got pregnant a month later and when he told his sister she said I was trying to trap him and he needed to get a DNA test because I am unhinged. This made me upset and I decided that I just had no desire to ever meet her until she at least apologized. Eight weeks in I had a miscarriage and when she was told she said, “ well, I’m sorry but I’m glad he’s not trapped by a psycho anymore!”
It’s been four months and I’m still having a hard time getting through it and my fiancé and I have moved in together and he has proposed. He told his sister he’s not been talking to her because of what she said about me and she needs to apologize.

My BF (34m) &amp; I (23f) have been dating for about 8 months. His family lives 2.5 hours away from the city we live in. I've met his family once before, but only briefly for his birthday. He's known most of his friends since elementary school.

I've never ever done Thanksgiving without my family before. This year we decided to visit his family. We drove 2.5 hrs to stay with his brother. We were there from the Wednesday before Thanksgiving to the Sunday after.

On Saturday BF, BF's brother, brother's GF, &amp; I were all going to go shopping. Before we could all get ready BF's brother gets a phone call. He tells us all that a couple of their friends from elementary-high school are in town on a date, &amp; that they want to visit. *(They were in town planning on surprising us with their company anyway.)* When I ask about them BF tells me that he &amp; ... let's call her Andrea... dated for a bit in Highschool. He says not to worry.

When his friends show up, the guy ... let's call him Patrick... tells us when they arrive that they're not on a date &amp; BF's brother needs to stop saying it. Things are fine, everyone is catching up. Patrick is kind &amp; makes me feel included. Andrea ignores me in almost all conversations &amp; only engages with the people there she's known since school. Totally normal &amp; not bitchy at all *(yet)* so I didn't think anything of it.

I pulled out a game called ""Bad People,"" it was fun for a bit. Then a prompt card came up that said, ""Who would be most likely to sacrifice everyone here to save themselves in a zombie apocalypse?"" I voted for Andrea for a few reasons &amp; I hoped my logic wouldn't offend her... I was wrong... Andrea started to yell at me, **""What!? Just because I don't live in the same state you think I'd sacrifice these people!? Is that what you think of me!? I can't believe you!!""**

She leaves. I note to BF and company that I didn't mean to make her upset. They all say she's not angry, but she was just yelling at me.

She had been making it very clear through body language and her actions that she still has a thing for my BF, staring at him, inching closer, calling him pet names, &amp; scowling at me. but nothing could prepare me for this.

**Andrea:** **""Hey honey, before I leave I'd love to talk to your mom! I miss her!! Facetime her for me, \[BF's nickname\]!""**

**BF:** \*laughs in disbelief\* **""Andrea, are you serious? You want me to facetime my mom? Right now??""**

**A:** \*in a stern tone as if she were commanding a child\* **""I would not have said it if I didn't mean it.""**

**BF:** **""Okay""** \*dials his mom\*

While Andrea was on the phone with his mom it sounded like his mom was more excited to FaceTime with Andrea than she was that I had come up to visit for the holiday.

When they were finally gone I couldn't help but cry. BF asked me why I was crying &amp; I tried to explain. He just blew me off &amp; told me I was being ridiculous.

Now between the two of us, I have more bills and all that and have a pretty good grasp of all my bills. 

My wife on the other hand doesn't have any bills presently but saves her money like crazy. She's also not the type of person to make random purchases or anything major for herself.

We were discussing the process for moving in, discussing a rental property Ive been working towards and so forth when she asked about getting a gaming console that costs about $400. She had stated she will use her own money

Now we will already have one that, though not brand new, can do the job well enough. 

I told her that I'm not on board with that idea because once she and I are together I'll need her help to manage the bills. And since she will not work for a bit it's important to conserve as much as possible. Since the whole movie alone will cost us $5000 easily between plane tickets, transport, etc. Which I will need her help on. 

She immediately became distant and upset even after I explained once she works full time and we are financially secure then put money aside for yourself or we can joint the savings and pay together but it's too risky to try and do this until such a time.

I remember since i can, than they give us to me and my sister giftcardd in Christmas because they are kinda far. My dad never had a good relationship with his father but in winter they started to talk more and go to football games because they support the same team, my little sister go with them sometimes.

In my last birthday when i turned 18, they call me (I have to say that we haven't talked for a year) my grandfather told me that he love me and he don't have a problem with what i ""chose"" but that I will always be his little girl. I get sad i just want to cry.

The last week my dad and sister go to a game with them, I knew that maybe they would want to see me, but i get anxious only thinking about the idea to talk with them. When they came back from the game, the only think that i did, was hiding in the bathroom.

My dad gave me the phone and my grandfather ask if i didn't change my number, he said maybe we need to talk more, just like before i came out. I only managed to say that i gonna be busy in December because i wanna star to working.

 My daughter was 12 (this was last year, she's 13 now) and she hadn't believed in Santa for a year or two. (As a parent of 7, stuff like this becomes evident when it starts to happen imo) and last year she kept saying things like ""yeah, mmhmm Santa, sure. Santa- dad you mean? Oh, yeah, Dad. Uh-huh, *santa* is going to get it for me"", And stuff like that when we would talk about asking santa for things, or to be on their best behavior because santa was watching, etc. And I mean, this was happening frequently. So I ended up saying something along the lines of ""yes dear, we realize ya don't believe anymore and that you know its your dad and I..."" well she acted like I had told her something she didn't know and was angry (I promise you that she 100% knew. As per your average teenage girl, she has a tendency of being a bit overdramatic and attention-seeking, especially as she is the middle daughter, which I get entirely, and always try to make sure she gets the attention she needs) So last year I was the bad guy for like 2 weeks during December.

 Well, while I was taking our youngest kids to school (no bus to their school so they have a different a.m. schedule than their older siblings), our 13yo was talking to her dad about the elf set up and saying things like ""oh look, a bunch of fake christmas crap, look at the elf, its pointless, its all fake..."" and proceeded to start complaining to him about how I absolutely ruined everything Christmas spirit related last year and she's done with it all, I guess.

I 33f have been married to my husband 40m for 10 years. We have two children and I've always had an ok relationship with my inlaws. We see eachother for holidays but I wouldn't consider all of us the closest. My BIL 43m who we will call D can be nice but is someone who likes to spin 'tall tales.' He will tell really outrageous stories, an example being recently he told me he got in a fight at a bar and before he knocked the guy out he kissed him and said 'goodbye sweetheart.' 
 He came over last week and as usual when he comes my husband went to bed early leaving me to entertain his brother which I do because I want to be polite. Eventhou he has a girlfriend he began to tell me how multiple models on social media are crazy about him and how horny it makes him. He went on and on talking himself up saying how woman can't resist him and I felt kinda uncomfortable. He then pulls out his phone showing me pictures of the woman he's talking about saved in his phone and they are all people who while are not close aquantinces I know who they are. I'm pretty sure he found them from my friendslist. The women he was talking about also just would not have anything to do with him.
 I told him I was tired and he needed to leave. After he left I contacted everyone who's picture I has seen and told them who he was and what he was doing so they had the opportunity to block him. They were all shocked but thankful I let them know. I also blocked him to prevent him from creeping more people I know. About a day later my mil contacted me asking why I blocked D on social media. I told her what happened and she blew up at me calling me a dramatic bitch. I'm shocked, she said I know how D is, but I have made him look bad, he is harmless. I may have hurt his relationship with his gf if this gets out. She told me to apologize to D for hurting him and breaking his trust. My husband is now saying you know how D is as well, is it necessary to cause waves during the holidays? I'm uninvited from Christmas as well as my children.

I treated Maggie very lovingly. I hosted her wedding shower, helped with her wedding, and extended numerous dinner invitations when she was alone. 

I recently decided to cut Maggie out of my life. She hosted a family dinner for James and his nieces/nephews, and siblings in my hometown. I was not invited. I found out on Facebook. When I told James how upset this made me, he accused me of being jealous/controlling. They don't understand how hurtful that was to me. My kids are furious. I decided I no longer want to have anything to do with Maggie. I no longer say hello to her, send her text messages, or have her on my SM accounts. 

James is sad this will ruin our future plans to spend our later years together. He called me an Ahole.

We talked for hours together on different topics. Eventually, religion and LGBT became the topic of conversation. The guy revealed to me that he is an unapologetic homophobe, and there was nothing that could change his mind about gay and trans people.

 I do not blame him completely as a lot people from his community are unapologetic homophobes. In the beginning, I patiently listened to him, with no opposition. However, he was going overboard with it and trying to convince me to be anti-lgbt as well.  He made the usual points such as they are 'unsanitary, unnatural, satanic, too sexual, etc'. The fact that he was forcing his opinions on me was pissing me off but I still calmly gave logical reasons as to why I would never be anti-lgbt. 

Somehow the topic got changed back to studies and stuff. However, while ending the call, he said something like, 'btw, the next time we meet, pls dont attack me with your lgbt army'. I was still mad at that point, so I responded with , 'and you, please dont attack lgbt people'. Then he was like 'ewww no, lgbtq people are so unsanitary , I would never even touch them.'  So, half jokingly, and half angrily , I said something like, 'but they are way more sanitary than the people of your national origin.'  Then he said a few racist things about my country. But the conversation somehow became normal again. 

Later he told me that the racist remark I made about his country had offended him. I was still kinda mad so I did not apologize for my comment. I instead called him a hypocrite for bashing and criticizing the LGBTQ community so harshly but not being able to take a single negative remark about his community. 

In his defense, all of his rants were not targeted at me or any aspect of my identity. But the comment I made directly targeted his nationality, which is why I feel like an asshole now. He had no intention of hurting me, he was just expressing his opinions. I did not even apologize for my racist joke yet. He maybe a homophobe and a hypocrite, but I directly offended and hurt him.

Some of that local family was leaving town on Thanksgiving, so my MIL decided we should celebrate early. My BIL, my out-of-town SIL and her family planned to visit here early as well as my husband’s out-of-state nieces and their spouses so, so far, reasonable thinking.

A few weeks ago, I walked into the living room where my husband was on the phone with MIL. I could hear the conversation and it was clear that the family was coming to our house for Early Thanksgiving because MIL didn’t think she’d have enough room to host at hers. I hadn’t heard a thing about this yet, so I was trying to catch my husband’s attention to clear this up with MIL. He waved me off until he hung up the call and when I asked “did your mother just invite everyone to OUR house without asking??” his response was, “yeah, she’s just like that. It makes sense, we have a bigger house.”

I hadn’t even been given a date for Early Thanksgiving dinner, so I asked when all of this was planning on going down and was advised it was for the Monday before actual Thanksgiving. I manage a retail store and as you can imagine we are hugely busy during the holidays so over the next week I had to move heaven and earth to be able to have that particular Monday off. I finally got it accomplished by having a manager come in from out of town, only to find out that my MIL rescheduled last minute because my BIL would have had to leave early on Monday. Basically, I found out on Saturday that dinner was now on Sunday and Monday was a bust.

First of all, in retail you still sometimes work on Sundays and to add to that, all of the stores in our region started a virtual volunteer event one Sunday evening a month where we all get on a group call online and plan and coordinate an in person event or do something virtual, like record reading books to kids, foreign language translation help, things like that. My store location was set to host the volunteer event on Sunday so I told my husband that if family was going to be coming over on that date I would be unavailable until after 6 PM.

Husband laughed it off until he was scrambling to get things ready on Sunday and I was busy. He got upset and blamed me for “faking” having to work. He was pissed that I wasn’t there to help, and then that I ducked into my office at four as his family was arriving and wasn’t done until roughly six (like I’d been telling him all along). When I finally came out, dinner was already over. His family was very confused because apparently my husband and his mother told them I didn’t actually have anything to do on a Sunday, that I was “hiding” from everyone. My husband also added that the least I could do after not helping him and shunning his family was to clean up, but I’d had quite enough at that point, made myself a sandwich, cleaned up after my own plate and went to bed.

Who currently has made friends with the new girl( Xania)
jaxson was following Xania around on her first day, claiming she asked him too. 
(Our school is very small, and have floor plans everywhere. As well as Me, Vern, and Oilla, all noticed that he's been skipping classes to walk Xania to her classes, as well as ditching , Me , Oilla, Vern and Horton, even when we are talking , to go find Xania. 
Once i had to pry Jaxson away from Xania because he was to busy talking while she was trying to politely get into her classroom, 
Then he got mad at me for dragging him away, when it was obvious (Im afab) that she wasnt interested and really wanted to get to class (bell already rung) 
Anyway , Me, Oilla, And Vern are all very open to him about how we view his actions around Xania. 
(he refused to tell me her name the first day because he wanted a chance to date her : he just met her that day, and i only asked for her name bc i like meeting people:) anyway,
He gets mad at us and accuses us of being in his business.
(He's very obvious and open about it , just by his body language.) The reason we do it is because we are mainly concerned about Xanias comfort. 
Hes always around her , and stuff, and he barely knows her but again likes her. 
(Unrelated but another reason me , vern , and Oilla get involved, is because he makes fun of girls who wear a lot of make up, claims they wear six pounds of make up and how its unattractive. Xania wears a lot of eye make up, and when i called him out on how he was being hypocritical and judging other girls, he said it was ""different"") 
Me , Vern , And oilla are all afab, and its easy to see Xanias emotions bc shes also Afab, and females are sorta easy to ready when it comes to other females.
Anyway, we all find it kinda concerning hes basically on the borderline of being obsessed. 

So , I was walking with Horton, and i saw Jaxson, and asked him , where xania was because usually he was with her during our breaks. (I wasn't being mean or anything and was just curious because i , Oilla and Vern have all agreed itd be good to get to know Xania since she just transferred to our school.)

Jaxson then looked at me and screamed, telling me to shut the Fuck up, and to Mind my own ""business""
He then said i was a ""fucking asshole"" and walked away. 
I was shocked. (Due to trauma i break down when screamed at , and Jaxson knows this , i was on the verge of crying when jaxson left because screaming scares me when directed at me.) I do accept i might be the asshole in this situation but my friends are all saying he was the asshole.

In the end of august/start of September we had regular house cleaning that I thought went fine. I always tip before they start, send payment to the owner when I receive the invoice, and then just head upstairs to my room. I don’t see them after that, they just let themselves out. My partner (J) came home and noticed that the carpet on all of our carpeted stairs (3/4 flights) had the exact same mark (like 4-6”) on the same side of every stair. The carpet was melted in those spots. We have cheap carpet in our place, it’s not like our floors are pristine or anything.  We sent a message with photos to the owner and she apologized and offered to come the next day to assess the damage. She said that they’ve had this issue with their vacuum once before. We were understanding and said no problem but our landlord (FIL) wants it fixed. She asked if she could try steaming it out/trimming the fibres, it was still noticeable. Since then the company has been back twice to try to fix the issue. She made it clear to us that she did not want to use her insurance as it would be pricy. She brought up money multiple times. When I received the invoice for the cleaning when the carpet was damaged. I told her I don’t  want to pay for the cleaning as if J has to take off time to deal with the carpet getting replaced that we’d be out money and it would be a huge inconvenience, but if it was able to be repaired with the carpet cleaning that I would pay. She didn’t respond to that message. I felt awkward so J took over communication. He set up the last attempt to try and fix it on October 31st, we informed the employee that came that it still wasn’t right and that we’d like it replaced. She agreed and basically said she didn’t even understand why she was sent to carpet clean the stairs. Haven’t heard from the company since. 

Yesterday I received the same invoice. I was frustrated and sent the owner a text basically saying, I’m disappointed as we’ve heard nothing since oct 31st, I was sure the invoice was from an automated service but could it please be removed so I could stop receiving it and to let us know about the carpet being repaired. She answered that she assumed it had gotten better since she hadn’t heard from us, she had done her due diligence and that she’d either delete the invoice or she would pay her insurance to replace, stating “I’ve been back there 3 times since this happened with no charge. I won’t be spending $1000 on my insurance and giving you guys a free clean, sorry.”

When my daughter separated two years ago and moved in on her own, she had a one week on one week off visitation schedule with her ex. The week she had her children. I agreed to watch the kids Sunday evening through Wednesday evening while she worked her night job , I live about one hour from her home and I work from home so on Sundays I leave my home about 5 PM to get to her house to watch the children. I stay overnight get up in the morning and then drive home and work. I repeat this each night and morning Sunday through Thursday morning. 
When I first started this, it was an every other week thing her ex has now lost his job or quit his job we’re not sure, and also was evicted from his home so he now sleeps on the couch of a friend. He no longer takes the children each week and barely sees them so now this babysitting job that I agreed to two years ago, has turned into an every week thing , I am no longer home Sunday through Wednesday evenings with my husband, my pets etc. I have told my daughter that this is getting to be too much and her usual standard answer is I know. I have done things like signed her up for care.com, looking for an overnight sitter, a few people replied to the ad, but she never reached out to them and never interviewed them. When I asked her why she said she assumed I was going to do it, I replied why would I interview people to babysit your children an hour away from my home and she didn’t really have a reply. I honestly can say that this is becoming overwhelming for me between travel back-and-forth my work, missing my husband and my own bed. I don’t sleep well when I’m at her house and I usually feel tired the next day. My daughter really cannot afford to pay a sitter as she is a blue-collar worker and making just enough money to get by with no assistance from her ex. No divorce papers have been filed, no custody agreements have been set. My daughter recently got a promotion, and when I told her she needed to think about working during the day, she said working daytime just wasn’t in her cards. 
I feel so guilty for not wanting to watch my own grandchildren but it’s just really becoming an overwhelming situation for me. Having her ex watch the children at her house isn’t an option as he is untrustworthy meaning he has been caught stealing from other people before and possible opiate addiction(we cannot confirm this, but it’s a possibility) A few times I wasn’t able to make it, she has gone to work(5 minutes from home) and returned on her breaks at 9pm 11pm and 1am to check on the kids and she monitors them thru video cameras around her home.

Sometimes if i’m awake and it’s my day off and he wakes a little later than he should he asks me to make him a coffee. which is super important to him as coffee to him sets the mood for the whole day.

i went to make him a coffee this morning and something happened that the coffee wouldn’t boil. Unless i took shrooms or something i know i put water as i have my little ritual and i remember putting it. The coffee thing ended up melting so obviously at some point in my ritual i fucked something up without noticing. He comes and says that i didn’t put water in it, and “it’s impossible that this happens unless you don’t put water” then he goes and slams the door to the bathroom to brush his teeth while swearing to himself. Then he left without saying goodbye.

then i texted him saying that i didn’t mean to burn the coffee and that i was sorry but it’s not ok for him to act like that and leave without saying goodbye. (this is something i strongly believe, to never part angry or without saying bye because anything could happen in those 8 hours you’re apart) and he said that it was because he slept an hour and that because he asked me and i didn’t do it, it made it so that he didn’t have time to do it himself and now he’s going to go without coffee for the day. And he said try waking up after sleeping an hour and see how you react. I just cried and unsent all the messages i sent him. Then when he came back he apologized and said that yes it was a mistake but it was a dumb mistake and making coffee is super simple.

My mum was 20 when I was born and her sister “Aunty Deb” was 17. We all lived with their mum, my Nan. I never knew who my dad was. Mum was in trouble when I was a baby, I was looked after a lot by Nan and Aunty Deb. 

She was locked up when I was 5 and they looked after me. When Aunty Deb was older and moved out, I went to live with her and Nan looked after me sometimes after school. Nan died a few years ago. 

Aunty Deb is the legal contact for the school and doctors etc.  she really supports me and tells me that she loves me. She’s tried to Meade up for not having mum around.  She now has a boyfriend “Joe”. I was nervous around him at first because I hadn’t really known any men before but he was nice to me, maybe like a dad, and I like him and eventually when he moved in I was happy. He takes me to sport and to watch football. 
Sometimes when we’re out, people think they’re my mum and dad and I feel normal. It’s nice. I feel bad that they’ve given up their life for me though. 

Things are about to change though. Aunty Deb is having a baby and mum is about to be released,we think. 
I worry I might have to go and live with her and I don’t want to. I do go and see her but it’s weird and I don’t feel I know her well. 
My friends mum says it won’t be my decision but what if Aunty Deb thinks it’s best for me to go to mum, they might let me and it might help her turn her life round. Also Aunty Deb and Joe will want to get on with life with their own baby. 

I think if I said I wanted to stay with Aunty Deb, she’d make it happen and keep me but she might not want to put up with me any longer and I don’t want to spoil things and it might really upset mum and get her in trouble again.

She works hard taking care of our kids and maintaining our home. I do what we have agreed is a fair portion of the housework and all of the yardwork. She has full access to all of our accounts except for my personal spending account. I put the exact same amount into her personal spending account but I can only deposit not withdraw.

I have a home office but I do not work from home it is just a place I can go to sit and catch up on anything I might need to from work and also play video games or play with my toys. 

My wife also has a room that is dedicated to her and her hobbies. 

I have asked her multiple times to please leave my room alone. I clean it myself. I take my dishes to the kitchen and either wash them or place them in the dishwasher. I take out my own trash. When I play with my kids in my office I clean up after all of us. When my wife joins me in my office for video games I clean up afterwards. There is quite literally no reason for her to do anything in there when I am not in it. I do not have a lock on my door but I do have my laptop password protected. 

I like to line up some of my collection of Lego Minifigs by my screen on my laptop. I like to imagine that Batman and Spider-man are watching me work. I know it is silly but I like it. 

For some reason my wife decided to go clean my office. I guess she needed to move my laptop so she closed it. Not all the way because my Minifigs were in the way. 

When I came home she told me what happened. The screen was not working at all. I had to get my old monitor out and hook it up so I could check and see if anything else was busted. 

It was just the screen. I checked and it would cost about $250 for parts and labor to replace my screen. So I decided to replace the laptop and use the old one with my old monitor for the kids. It was fine other than the non working screen. 

The cost to replace my laptop was only $600, Yay Black Friday. 

So I took $350 from my account and I took $250 from the money I was going to deposit into her personal account for December and I got my new computer. 

This will in no way affect our budget for anything other than our own personal side projects and hobbies. I was looking forward to getting myself a new Lego set to work on with my kids over the holidays but now I will have to rebuild one of my old ones with them. Which is also fun

Well now she is pissed at me because she has to cut back on her fun stuff for December. She likes to have a spa day with her mom for example. I said that I wasn't responsible for my computer being broken and that she 100% was. She said it was an accident and that I should forgive her. I said I  wasn't upset, but that if she felt I should forgive her then I fully forgive her but she still has to help me pay for a new laptop.

That day or two that she stays with us ends up being a week. I would tell my husband on how I feel about that, first we don't have a big space, second we only have one TV which is in the living room and she uses it all day, third I am just wanting some privacy and I end up being in my bedroom the whole time after a long day at work.

A little context: I was born with Sickle Cell Anemia, that causes my blood cells to be shaped like a crescent moon instead of a round circle. It creates blockage in my blood flow and reduces the oxygen in my blood cells, which causes me to have a lot of pain in my body. I’ve been taking medication since I was a baby, so I take it pretty seriously. If you want to know more about it then you can just look it up.

Anyway, I had my invisalign appointment scheduled a few days ago (on Monday) and I 100% planned to go, until that morning. I woke up with an awful pain in my side and I immediately knew I wasn’t going to go anymore. I told my mom about the pain and that I don’t plan on going to the dentist anymore, but she insisted that I go because she had to pay a $75 fee if I didn’t go. I didn’t want to take any risks because Sickle Cell could land me in the hospital if I’m not careful. So I stayed home and took some pain meds, because in all honesty, my disease is more important than straightening my teeth. She got mad at me and ended up calling me “selfish” and “self centered” because I didn’t take the money into consideration, which I think is hilarious since she of all people should know how serious Sickle Cell is. I wake up and go to my job when I need to just so I don’t have to ask for money from my parents. They already pay for my school tuition, so I think it’s only fair that I have a job so they don’t spend more money on me. I’m very aware of how much things cost and I’m very grateful to be privileged and blessed with two parents in my house who’ve paid for everything. I haven’t talked to her since and she knows I’m upset, but she chooses to act like nothing happened and ignores my feelings.

For 2/3 years I have been having a really bad time mentally, for a while I cried myself to sleep almost every night, expecially on lockdown. That was bc my grades went down during COVID, and my mom kept pressuring me into basically doing nothing but study, but still my grades didn't get better. That led to me feeling like a disapointment and some really dark thoghts. Since then, I developed some really self trust issues and I have been super stressed when it comes to school ever since, I get anxious with every test and that stress spread to other things in my life as well, to the point where I need to be doing something all the time or else my head starts berrading me with negative thoughts (the problems I mentioned aren't all, just the ones more relevant to the story, there's others who just pile on and make things even worst)

I had just got done with studying maths and I went to my room a bit to play some games and relax, then my mom came in and started asking me if I thought this was the way to get ""the results I want"", etc. I kept my cool, saying that I was working and that I just needed to shut my brain off a bit, untill she mentioned the time when I was worst and how she suffered thinking that I could have a mental ilness, saying that I didn't know how she suffered. I responded that I was sure she didn't suffer as bad as me, and then she started saying that I had no idea, since I don't have a son. I then answered, more agerly, that she didn't know how I suffered, since she was not in my head to see how an absolute mess it was (and is) and that saying things like that wasn't at all good and propper from a parent, since she was really downplaying my feelings, she stormed out and started crying.

Then my fucking sister came in, determined to be the White Knight for my mother and acused me of being an asshole, that I had no right to say that ""to the woman who carried me for 9 months"". I clapped back, now furious, telling her to go fuck herself and when she hit me I swear to god I was going to hit her back, but I just threatened her to never do that again.

Thank you!

SO, Me (23M) and my gf (22F) have been together for 8 months. I love her very much and we both are every secure in our relationship and our boundaries. I want to note that she takes loyalty very seriously (as do I) and she doesn't appreciate following random girls on Instagram or talking to girls she doesn't know. These are valid and I too have these boundaries for her. 

Now to the situation. For background, I have a diverse group of friends from college. About 12 of us and its half guys and half girls. All been close since 2018! I have one friend in the group, we'll call her Olivia. Olivia and I have always been very close friends and it happens that in November 2021 we had s3x a few times. It didn't last and I don't really see her as often as she moved home from our college town. 

She and my gf knew each other too from their freshman year dorm and my gf dislikes her. Olivia was rude to her in the past and my gf of course dislikes my history with her and that we have had s3x. She is uncomfortable by me hanging out with her and I understand that. 

I have Olivia added on pretty much anything you can have friends on - Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Be Real, Nintendo. You name it. I follow 3 of Olivia's Instagram accounts (art account, persona, and finsta). We are in groupchats together on both text and snapchat with our friend group. My gf does not expect me to remove myself from my friends because of Olivia, and the people I'm closest with aren't really best friends with Olivia so typically there isn't a case where I'm hanging out with her. 

My gf and I got on the subject of things that make us uncomfortable that the other does (not giving examples, just discussing the general topic of coming to each other about these things). She then said ""I can think of something but I don't want to get into it."" So I pressed her until she told me. What she said is that she hates that I have Olivia added on every social media possible and wishes I'd remove her. She then said that she ""knows I won't do it.""

I told her I don't think that's necessary and I don't feel comfortable causing issues with Olivia and completely removing her because my gf dislikes her. My gf said that basically I'm an asshole for putting a girl who she hates and that I've had history with above my gf. I simply don't see it that way. She expressed how it shouldn't be a problem to remove her, but she knew I'd have issues doing it and it makes her feel like she can't fully believe that I do not care about Olivia anymore.

I run the family tomato farm as my older brother wasn't interested in taking it over when our parents got too old to keep up with the demands it has.

As the kids are staying with me for the time being I decided they'd help out on the farm in age appropriate ways, nothing too taxing and honestly far less than what my brother and I did at their ages. If they do this in the morning they're free to spend the afternoon as they please. I think it's a good way to teach them responsibility and besides I don't have kids so the farm might end up being taken over by one of them one day if they take an interest in it.

My brother and SIL phone the kid each night to say goodnight/check how they're doing and they mentioned how they were helping out on the farm, when I talked to my brother and SIL after the kids said goodnight my SIL was angry and demanding to know why I was forcing her children to work and how they were here on vacation and it wasn't right of me to do that. My brother asked what they'd been doing and when I told him it was mostly mucking out the stables and feeding the animals he tried to talk her down but she was even more upset to know her children were doing something so ""dirty.""

I was rather bemused by this as it's honestly not that bad it's not like they're rolling about in the dirty stables. I told her how they were having fun and it's honestly not that bad and did no harm to me and my brother growing up. 

She has told me she doesn't want my kids lifting a finger for the rest of the time I have them and it's their holiday so they should be treated as such, my brother clearly thinks she's overreacting but he also tends to defer to her in most things so i'm getting no support there. Honestly I don't know what to do, i'm running a business not a resort so I can hardly wait on them hand and foot while my brother and SIL are on holiday.

There’s a lot of reasons for this. I know she resents my mom for dropping out of college to marry my dad, so she takes a lot of “playful” shots at him and I always feel the need to defend him. It’s put kind of a strain on our relationship. My grandfather died when I was 16 and that changed her quite a bit. That’s to be expected, so I’m not faulting her, but she became very clingy to my whole family. 

All that said, I really do love her, but she’s gotten to the point where she has outright told my mom that she doesn’t like it when any of the family does anything without her. My aunt, uncle, and cousin live close to her and invite her to do a lot. But my parents and my husband and I live nearly 3 hours away from her. It’s not reasonable to invite her to come to the movies with us. But that’s basically what she wants. 

Anyway, like I said, she’s been really lonely since my grandfather died. Her mother (my great grandmother)lived with her up until she died about 6 months ago. I get it. She’s lonely. But recently, I mentioned to her that my husband and I are planning a trip to Hawai’i in about a year. She asked if she could come. She and my grandfather went before he died and I know she really loved it. She says she wants to relive that. 

My husband is thinking about giving in, but I’m standing firm. We’re really excited about this trip and I want it to be just us. We’re going to start trying for kids after, so it’s kind of our last adults only trip. We’ve only been married a little over a year, so he doesn’t have the same strained relationship with her that I do and he wants to keep the peace and let her come.

While at a store like Marshalls/TJ Maxx (store with long aisles of clothing across majority of store) I was in an aisle going through clothes when a woman in a riding wheelchair/mobility cart came down the aisle. I was about halfway down the aisle and this caused me to have to backup with my cart very clumsily (because the cart continuously gets stuck on the base of the aisles and you have to pick it up and jiggle it out)and leave the aisle so she could get by. Whatever no worries. She ended up just using the aisle as a way to get across the store, but no big deal, I get it, she needs to get across somehow. 

I move into the next aisle and same lady wants to come down the aisle again. Again I needed to backup with my cart and leave the aisle. Again she's only using it as a hallway, she's not shopping. At this point I'm a little like (really? Just the aisle I'm in? But whatever I moved). 

The following aisle I'm about 75% done with the aisle when here she comes. I smiled at her but didn't move. My friend gets bent out of shape and says ""She needs you to move so she can get by"". I replied politely ""She can wait"" and turned to her and said ""Gimme just one moment."" Woman was very nice about it. She backed up the small amount so we could get out a moment later. Life went on. 

The store was relatively empty no one was anywhere near us, she had done this to me 3 times and never once even stopped to look at an item(if she were a child you'd think she was playing with the cart) and I was ALMOST out of the aisle. 

Afterwards my friend got really upset and said that it's none of my business why the woman wasn't shopping(maybe she's looking for her size) or why she was going up and down the aisles I was in causing me to have to backup with my cart across the whole store. She said she's handicapped, she deals with enough as it is and it's her business, not mine. She claimed I think I'm more important than everyone else. 

I didn't see it this way. In my opinion if a store is basically empty and there are 50 aisles to choose from, you don't continually inconvenience the only other people shopping when you aren't even shopping. I told my friend that the final time, the 3rd time, this lady could have waited a moment (which she did) for us to get finished up. She's upset.

I went to therapy and we felt this was the best way forward, and it has been as I've been able to sort of heal I suppose? Still, a LONG way to go but eh. My mum and friends are supportive of me doing whatever I feel is best in this scenario but I wanted an outsiders POV.

My dad invited her down for Christmas and I don't want to go. I've had a rocky relationship with my dad for a while now and I know he isn't ever going to defend me from her as he brushes it off and refuses to listen to me because it's his mum and 'you know what she's like' (his words).

Long story short I got her pregnant our first time together and she doesn't want to keep it. I get that she's still young and wants to live her life but I feel that I'm ready to be a father and starting a family with her.

Her parents are very strict and have expectations with her since they pay for mostly everything. They also believe in keeping babies whether it was an accident or not.

We have been fighting about this a lot and I've tried to come up with solutions that would make us both happy but she's firm on her decision. Like her having the baby and me taking care of it by myself giving her no responsibility.

I want to tell her parents so maybe they'll make her change her mind but I have a feeling they'll cut her off and I know how important family is to her.

She has been ignoring my texts and calls and I don't know what to do. I don't know whether to tell her parents and come to an agreement or to just terminate it and break up since it's causing a huge split between US.

I (15f) have a strict but mostly reasonable mother(32), I want to get it out of the way now she has said, word for word, ""no daughter of mine will look like a boy"". Due to her feelings on this I am not allowed to cut my hair anywhere above my shoulders, I am expected to at least wear something ""nice"" on formal events, most oftenly stuff such as dresses, heels/sandals and makeup or earnings; and she is constantly making small remarks on how I could wear something nicer even for normal/daily events such as school or just going shopping. She does let me wear knee long shorts out when it's hot, and while I'm allowed jeans, short sleeve shirts, or sweaters outside: in any other situation, nothing overly showing, such as things men would wear. No tank tops, thigh high shorts, you likely get the idea. My mother has told me if I ever want to talk with her I can, and while she is fine with those registered under pride she feels there has just been to many different sexualities made in ""order to feel special"" and does have a few other negative things to say about it.
  Sorry for the long explanation, but with that out of the way I want to get to why I post this. Recently I was going through old photos to clear up space on my phone and I noticed a few things, different photos caught my eye where my hair was WAY shorter then what my mom would allow, and while I vaguely remember some reasons, it was still a surprise. A photo from 2015/2016 where my hair was a pixie cut, almost ear length, I would of been roughly 8 in that one; and another in 2020 where my hair was still growing back from a full head shave due to lice, we had to shave it because my hair was to thick at the time. (Roughly 13/14 yrs at that time) there's a few spare more sprinkled between those times but I noticed in each of them I actually seemed happy. Checking photos my mother took of me with her expectations I could always tell it wasn't genuine, and she's even pointed out a few times why don't I smile despite putting one on for photos. I'm realizing now that I don't really like being female, or at least all the feminine expectations coming with it and I'm not sure what to do. I've asked an openly gay friend I know from online and they've told me wait until I'm a bit older and save up some money, so that way if she does kick me out I have some kind of back up plan, and I kind of agree with this.

So to give more context I work a  6 - 2 job which means I get up @5 to get ready then travel to my work. I'll work a normal 5 days a week but the schedule is always changing, sometimes I'll be off on Thursday's and Fridays or sometimes Tuesday's and Wednesday's.

Now I get she wants to spend time with each other but that's all I'm doing whenever I'm not working or doing errands. I don't have any friends to go out with, and I enjoy being home watching my son play and be his wild self.

So this morning it's my day off and she's working and she tells me to get up since her alarm went off. I tell her I want to sleep in but she insists and keeps saying "" Get up, Up."" I just wanted to sleep in until my son wakes up which is usually between 8 - 9 in the morning. Not a lot of time but I wanted that luxury to at least sleep until my son is awake. But nope my GF, for 20 solid minutes, kept whining for me to wake up, even though I told her she needs to get ready for work.

This stopped when he went to university (where I met him) and he started going on holiday with friends and spent a season working somewhere where he could ski the entire season. I have some experience skiing but not as much as him or his family but did go out whilst he was working abroad to ski with him and I had a great time.

Me and my partner have been together 4 years and were long distance but moved in together into a flat a couple years ago, he made the move to me and I am forever grateful that he was happy to do that and he has settled really well into the area.

His mother messages the family group chat every day, especially if they are on holiday, I'm totally okay not being in the one that excludes me and his brother's partner. His mother can be a little overbearing too but she just loves her sons a lot.

My boyfriend and I, always make an effort to drive (5 hours) down and visit his family and attend any major events, and his family are really lovely and do include me in things such as letting me come on holidays in our own country, paying for our accomodation and I am really grateful.

Fast forward to today when my partner asks me ""hey so my parents have invited me and my brother skiing offering to pay for us but if you want to come, you have to pay for yourself, want to come?"" I asked if his brother's girlfriend was invited he said he thinks so but she has never been skiing and doesn't want to (partners parents already knew this about her). I thought it was odd that I was invited and so asked my partner to see the message just to check.

The message read ""would you and your brother like to come skiing with us for one last time like we used to? The offer is excluding girlfriends :)"" Further on in the message it did say if I came I would have to pay, but I don't think I'm really invited at all and as much as I would love to come, my partner's parents know I can't really afford to go especially as they know me and him are trying to save to go skiing next year with a group of people to celebrate one of my family member's birthday.

I got upset with my partner saying ""why would you invite me to something that I'm obviously not invited to!? they've evidently put up a barrier to stop me from coming"".

I am often tasked with running errands for the family I work for, and they have given me a work credit card for expenses while we are out. I am allowed to occasionally use the card to go out to eat with the kid I nanny (NK) while we are running errands. 

The other day, we were out and I decided to stop in at a deli for lunch. It was a small shop with 3 tables. They had one bathroom. I needed to change my NK’s diaper and so I placed our order, told the cashier we were going to the bathroom while we waited, and took my NK in the bathroom to change him. 

My NK is going through a phase where he hates having his diaper changed. I think it’s because he had a horrible diaper rash a few weeks ago that looked super painful and that’s when this all started. 

He starts crying and screaming the second I lay him down, and it takes me calmly talking to him for a few minutes and stroking his hair for him to chill out and stop flailing. Then I hand him a toy to distract him and change him. The family I work for uses very complicated cloth diapers as well, the whole process takes like 15 minutes. 

When we went to the bathroom, we were the only customers in the shop. As soon as I laid him down and he started freaking out, someone knocked on the door. I said “I’ll be out in a few minutes!” And continued what I was doing. After like 5 or so minutes, once he had chilled out and I had began the diaper change (it was a bad one) this woman knocked again loudly. I said “still in here” and she started yelling through the door, “I am a senior and I have bladder issues, I need to use this bathroom.” I said “I am changing a diaper, and I’ll be out soon.” 

Not even thirty seconds later she started POUNDING on the door, full on screaming to get out and scared my NK who started crying. I got mad and lost my cool and yelled “THIS IS A PUBLIC BATHROOM. I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE IN HERE. SHUT UP AND GO AWAY” and after that she stopped banging. I came out with my NK on my hip and this woman didn’t say a word but was very elderly and she was shooting me dagger eyes as she hobbled crouched over into the bathroom.

I'm currently pregnant with our third child and have told him that this bothers me but he absolutely won't budge on this issue and insists that i'm jealous and paranoid. He refuses to give up on spending time with her ""in a group setting"" outside work hours.

She started working at his office a few months ago. When I asked, he admitted he found her attractive and when pressed, he admitted she'd be someone he'd date if he weren't with me. At lunchtime, he and his colleagues all choose to eat together and now she's part of that group. Almost every week night he plays video games, sometimes alone, sometimes with male colleagues and I recently found out she'd been playing with him too, along with other colleagues (so he says). 

My problem with this is he has cheated on almost all his past partners and even on me at the start of our relationship because (his words) he's always had a problem saying no, he spends far more time gaming than with me in the evenings and he therefore spends more of his life with this person who he finds attractive than with his own pregnant wife. I *have* been going to bed earlier because I need more sleep when pregnant but the rare times we've spent together he's just seemed bored and it's killed it for me. Perhaps not relevant, but since she started at his work he's started making more of an effort with his appearance too.

I revenge cheated years ago when we were just dating (he knows) but have since stopped all forms of contact with men i'm attracted to and pretty much men in general because I'm married and think this is disrespectful. I also literally don't care about anyone else and am busy bringing up our kids. The only thing wrong I've been doing is replying to an old friends with benefits when he gets in contact once a year. Those two-minute messaging conversations once a year are just us catching up and talking about our kids and my husband has seem them. I have agreed to stop replying to him though because it bothers my husband and although I don't and have never had feelings for this person i'm not stupid enough to think he just wants to chat. I take my husband's feelings into account whereas he's refusing to budge.

I moved in with her 2 years ago (during the pandemic) to get away from the big city I was living in, and to recover from an eating disorder. 

My grandmother lost her licence the year I moved in because of failing eyesight. It really hit her hard because she was used to being independent, and all of a sudden had to rely on Ubers, taxis and my mom (who lives down the street) to drive her around. I've never had an interest in driving, having lived in a big city most of my life, but when I was in high school I'd gotten a learner's permit. I let it expire though after a traumatic driving session where I made a mistake and almost got into an accident and was screamed at by my instructor while I sobbed uncontrollably in the driver's seat. 

I was really nervous to get my full licence and be responsible for driving my grandmother around. I have anxiety and I'm always afraid that I'll get into an accident and seriously injure/kill someone, and I have trouble with multitasking. I don't trust myself to be able to pay attention to everything I need to pay attention to when I'm behind the wheel and it baffles me that people seem to treat driving as a routine task like cooking dinner or getting dressed. The responsibility of getting behind the wheel and being a safe driver terrifies me, and I don't trust myself to be able to do it.

My parents adopted foster kids. One of the kids, that was a foster and not adopted by my parents, her choice, but aged out while living with them is the subject of this story. I will call her selfish sister (SS). SS had given birth to a child when she was 21. She was more interested in getting drunk or high and often left the child alone. The final straw was abandoning it at a 24 hour day care.  I guess she assumed that she could leave her there for 3 days while she went out of state. That is how I became guardian of the child. A few years later I legally adopted her. Baby Girl was born with fetal alcohol syndrome. I will never forget the day SS asked me if that was something that she caused. Good grief! Does she not understand how biology works. 

Recently, I found out that my baby girl is going to be a mother. She wanted to share the exciting news with her bio mom. I was reluctant but I supported her in that decision   Wishing for the best we stopped at her house. Oh boy were we wrong it would blow up in our face. SS sure lived up to her name. She got angry with my baby girl. SS threw it in her face how her life is forever ruined. Miss Self righteous SS was angry because we didn’t give her time to adjust to the idea before springing the news. It wasn’t her fault that she said those things to baby girl. We should have warned her prior to allow her time to process such important news. Uhm baby girl is 20. She is sexually active. It happens, deal with it.   After SS made a scene claiming how ruined her life had been because of baby girl. I think baby girl saws flames shooting forth from my eyes. She took my hand and said, mom lets leave. 

1 month later and zero contact SS calls me. SS, “Uhm are we okay with each other?” Me, “No! We are not okay!” SS continues trying to justify her attitude but I am not having anything to do with it. After all the years of rejecting baby girl and not even trying to show compassion to her this was the final straw. Listening to her rant about how she did not “sign up for this” I lost it. 

Baby Girl just wanted to be accepted if not for herself then maybe for the unborn child. So I did what I did 20 years ago. I protected baby girl from her selfish bio mom. 

Now the rest of my siblings and parents are saying I was wrong in blowing up on her and blocking her number. That I should have just let it be. 

AITA for protecting my baby girl and telling SS that she is not welcome. Christmas is coming up. Should I have just kept my mouth shut. I don’t even want her going to my parents home.

So... I (f26) usually keep to a budget for Christmas for friends and family. The budget I have for my sister (f24) is £30. For Christmas, I recently spent £16.99 on a piece of band merch from her favourite band that is currently on hiatus, after getting it approved by her best friend. Due to being under budget, I asked her if there was anything else she wanted/needed. She asked me for a Morphe eyeshadow palette that was £5 over the remaining budget. I agreed and she said she would get me a palette of my choice in return. This palette is currently £16 in Boots, however it is out of stock. I found it on another website for £20 along with a discount code (the palette is £25 on the official morphe website). My sister agreed so I ordered hers that weekend. Fast forward today and she has decided as the palette is £16 in Boots, she won't buy it from another site. Despite it being out of stock. It's the only thing I've suggested which she has agreed to buy.

For most of my friends it's just a friendly joke and nothing more. However Isabella decided this school year to take it further. She said that lack of organization skills is getting old and basically stopped helping me out. She apparently did it to encourage me to improve my organizing skills.

All it ended up doing though was stressing me out more. She has said a lot of hurtful things including how I'm stupid or irresponsible. I forgot my calculator for a test and rather than lend me her spare one, I had to ask the teacher for one and deal with being embarrassed in front of the whole class. I forgot my sports bra in gym and had to sit it out that day and got in trouble. Isabella had no sympathy and basically said ""when will you learn?"". It's like she thinks I'm her child or something. 

I've gotten better about organizing and preparing this year and i think it's despite Isabella's ""help"". So you can imagine my reaction when she found herself unprepared and had to ask me for a pad.

My grandmother lost her licence the year I moved in because of failing eyesight. It really hit her hard because she was used to being independent, and all of a sudden had to rely on Ubers, taxis and my mom (who lives down the street) to drive her around. I've never had an interest in driving, having lived in a big city most of my life, but when I was in high school I'd gotten a learner's permit.

I was really nervous to get my full licence and be responsible for driving my grandmother around. I have anxiety and I'm always afraid that I'll get into an accident and seriously injure/kill someone, and I have trouble with multitasking. I don't trust myself to be able to pay attention to everything I need to pay attention to when I'm behind the wheel and it baffles me that people seem to treat driving as a routine task like cooking dinner or getting dressed.

Me and my friend have been friends for a while. I’ve helped him out in college and he has said that I was a big part of his life and that I mean a lot to him. 
Great! Love the guy. 
But his wife is your typical church going gal, super bubbly, nice all around. Until it comes to me.
She is “nice” to me. Not kind. Just “nice.” 
Feels like we’re gritting our teeth when we are around making small talk. 

There’s a weird reason why we don’t really get along. 
There was this one “Panel of Women” our church did that she was apart of back in college that she said that “any “man” that swears/uses foul language, has no desire for God and his heart is evil and broken” and LOOKED right at me and every one saw it. 
Mind you, I do* swear a lot, but! I have been working on it for as long as I can remember, and during this time I was dealing with alot of trauma of losing my mom, my cousin, my sisters drug addiction, my dad’s homelessness, etc. 
it felt like no matter what I did I was never going to be good enough for these people. 

it really cut me deep and I just kind of quit hanging out with that group of people but still talked to my friend/her now husband for a few years and again we got really close, like he was my little brother. 

Well they get engaged and I was really happy for them, cuz I genuinely love it when people fall in love and marry, it’s great! 
I asked them when and where. 
Got ignored FOR MONTHS. 
Weird. But hey it’s a crazy time. 
But when I was told by her that I wasn’t invited to her wedding out of nowhere. Like a week before the wedding. 
And said “I know you’re really close with “husbands name” but I really don’t think you Love Jesus. And I don’t think you’d have fun”
What?! 
I am a Christian lol 
I have had my doubts but I still believe. 

I ended up telling her that I respect her wishes but that I considered her very shallow and downright judgmental and rude. And I asked her husband where I can send them a wedding gift, it was just your typical wedding gift, a congrats card, and a picture I made for them. But I was ignored. 

Ngl I grieved the loss of that friendship, like it. HURT. but I grew from it and learned a lot and I feel great now! 

But they messaged me and said they needed help of making her monthly budget of $3000+/month. 
I said that they were being a bit ridiculous asking for help considering she has a degree and he’s making good money. And that while yes, we were* close, that that wasn’t the case anymore. I also said, 7 months and no text? No call? 
It just feels very. Odd to me. 

Anyways I got a few mixed reaction messages and mixed feelings about this cuz I care but I’ve moved tf on. 
I also don’t like helping people who are more than capable of helping themselves because I shouldn’t have to. You chose the life of a broke ass missionary, not my or other’ responsibility to help with that. Like HELLO??

In this text he said he’ll be taking a break from me. 

At first I was really sad because he seemed to be really hurt because of me and there’s nothing I can do about it. 

Then after a few week I began being really mad that he just throws away our friendship like that. Also a lot of things that have happened in the past made sense now. 
Although what made me most upset is that he still hasn’t reached out to me and even ghosts me on all platforms. I didn’t really text him, just once that I miss him, so he doesn’t think I don’t care. He ignored it all. I get it he’s upset and I left him alone  after that. I did start to feel like he’s not going to come back and that makes me feel like if he can’t have me he doesn’t want me as a friend. It feels like our whole friendship was a lie. 

Now my sister and him became friends kinda about 5 months ago because I introduced them to each other. They never met up they only talked when I was with them to play on discord. So not really friends but my sister found him really funny. 

When he confessed to me and I asked my sister for help she told me to date him cause she doesn’t want to lose him. She said it as a joke but I know she was being serious. 

I’ll spare you of more details so basically 
My sister told me ""I can tell you this now because you’re not that upset about him anymore"" and she goes on to tell me about a funny meme he send her. I was like ""oh okay why does he send you this now?"" Because I thought it was random but she tells me ""yea he’s actually been texting me a while some snaps and memes on TikTok""
And I began being upset and say ""wow so he ignores me but still texts you"" she said ""ugh see? This is why I didn’t tell you"" I told her ""well yeah I’m upset that he’s ignoring me and you guys are still joking around"" she responds with ""just because you guys don’t talk anymore doesn’t mean I can’t talk to him. Also it’s only been like 4 things we don’t text regularly""

I thought she’s got a point so I just left it. 

Then a few days later she laughs and shows me a snap of him hanging out with his friends using the monkey filter (the filter is kind of an insider). And again I got really upset but I didn’t say anything cause I know how she sees it.

We maintained a loving and respectful relationship, which is why I always go to services when I visit them. My boyfriend comes along when we visit together, even though he's also atheist. 

Last week we were staying with them for my mom's birthday and everything was great. We went to a service on Sunday morning. Just after we left, my boyfriend's sister, who was watching his/our dog, texted us that she was rushing him to the vet, fearing he ate something. He threw up and was acting strange. 

We awaited an update during the service and my boyfriend was very nervous. Finally he got a text from his sister, who said his dog is okay and might just have a stomach problem. They were gonna run some tests, but he was acting okay again. 

We were very relieved. We half-hugged and I just gave him a kiss, happy to see him relax. I didn't think about it, nad it was a very short, quiet kiss.

Not even a minute later, a woman who was sitting behind us leaned over and told us to leave if we were going to act like that. We looked at her, I quickly explained it was just an instinct and that we got some news, but she didn't even let me finish the sentence. So I signaled my boyfriend to turn away and ignore her. She insisted that we leave again, this time louder and backed by her companions. I politely asked her to leave us alone. She didn't and soon my family started looking over and interfering.

As soon as the service was over, me and my boyfriend went outside. We were caught up by the woman, who said she will file a formal complaint to ban us from the church. My mom played the voice of reason as I was started to get more and more irritated. In the end we just told the lady to deal with her issues and left. 

Some of my family were angry at me, or us, and my mom told me I should've just left instead of disturbing the sevice. I argued that the woman was the one who disturbed it, and that we didn't make out, it just happened in a moment which I tried to explain.

Now, my aunt and uncle went on a crazy diet in January and ended up losing a bunch of weight. They make it a point to target and harrass me about mine, even when I'm eating or out with family. (I'm not unhealthily overweight, just curvy and slightly chubby). The last couple of times they've visited, my uncle and especially my aunt have made it a point to wear only my clothes to prove how slim and healthy they've gotten.

No, my uncle hasn't taken to wearing my dresses. By clothes, I mean the loose t-shirts or pants I wear to bed/at home. The thing is, I wouldn't mind sharing with my aunt once or twice because she forgot her clothes, but they never bring their own sleepwear now! It's always my clothes! They've actually said it to my face— we don't bother bringing clothes to wear at home as we can use yours.

I can't describe the amount of anger and agitation, and above all, embarrassment I feel every time they publicly bring up the fact that they're wearing my clothes as I'm chubby, hence my clothes are looser and uncomfortable. 

Not only do they wear my clothes without my permission, they're extremely intrusive as well. They go through my private stuff, my underwear drawer etc. My dad also feels very uncomfortable, and my mom sympathizes with me, but I have no idea how to broach the subject. I know I could just as easily ask them to stop going through my stuff, and I would, except that my aunt and uncle have fragile egos and zero emotional intelligence. I don't want to permanently damage my family's relationship with them, but at the same time, they make me very uncomfortable and frankly, depressed every time they visit, telling me how there's something or the other wrong with my body.

For instance, my aunt told me that stretch marks on breasts are not normal and that my breasts were not supposed to sag, or how she was sure that I've been gatekeeping some chemical treatment (which she thinks I've been doing) for acne/pimples/acne scars. Neither my mom or dad had pimples, and I've always been very particular about my hygiene from a younger age, so I guess it's natural that Iive never had pimples, acne or any other skin issues.

I love my dog to pieces, I really do. I am also married to a American and moving there from Europe in the next two years. I always knew I would take my dog with me, however recently he had several seizures and eventually got diagnosed with Epilepsy. Ever since then I'm torn.

My dog is too big to fly in cabin meaning he would have to go as cargo. Whilst I would not be too worried if he was healthy I am now that he could have a seizure without me being able to give him his medicine.

He gets medicine 2x a day at set times. Because I'm working switching shifts my mother takes care of that. I already feel guilty because of that but unfortunately I don't have another option cause she has a set schedule and can make sure he gets medicated in time while I can't. With his medicine he doesn't have seizures anymore. Timewise it would be easy to dose so that he shouldn't need anything else during the flight. But the what if is what haunts me.

Also due to time difference I would need to slowly get him on a new schedule for the medicine once we arrive which is possible but hard since I would also need to find a job there that allows me to have the exact same rythm every day. Which I don't know if I'll be able to do as I can't be too picky if I don't want to rely on my husband when it comes to income for too long.

I would also need to find a new competent vet and source for his medicine. But I believe that likely would be easy even if more expensive than currently.

My mom loves my dog and even before his diagnosis begged me to leave him with her cause she and her dog love him so much. He doesn't like many dogs but he definitely enjoys my moms. The first time he ever actively played was after we got my moms dog and the two are really sweet together. So I do also feel like I would be ripping them apart.

But I can't help but feel like I'm abandoning him by not taking him with me, but at the same time I feel selfish taking him with me cause it would likely be easier for him to just stay. 

I considered staying here until he passes, but I quickly realized it wouldn't be fair to my husband or me because it's already hard on us to be so far away and prolonging that for an unknown time and keeping our lifes and family plans on hold would likely worsen our well being.

I need some neutral opinions.
