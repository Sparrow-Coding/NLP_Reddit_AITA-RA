The city she lives in now is really far from where we live, so we visited to say goodbye to her and her little brother, let’s call him Trevor.

So Trevor’s first language isn’t English and he learned English through me and my older sister who used to live abroad and mostly from these very cringey YouTubers that neither me nor my best friend like. Let’s just say they aren’t the best examples for little kids.

My little brother (10M) is my pride and joy and I love him more than I love anything else in the world, so while my parents were out for vacation they put me and my siblings in the care of my uncle (a doctor) my grandfather (retired nurse) and we also had a caretaker for my brother who had been with us for four years, so we’re doing fine.

 Now here’s where I might be an asshole.

The night before they left, my brother got frustrated that the Wi-Fi was gone (we’d been using their Wi-Fi and they had packed it up) and my other brother (16M cerebral palsy) was screaming for the same reason. My little brother got overstimulated quickly because along with the screaming, Trevor was playing one of his offline games and raging at losing against the computer.

At first I tried asking Trevor to turn down the volume, and explained to him that since my little brother was autistic, loud noises really made him upset. Trevor agreed at first, but quickly went back to hurling curses at his IPad.

The caretaker was trying to help as best she could to her credit, and my sister was trying to calm down our other brother. Meanwhile Trevor was making these monkey sounds that sounded like he was mocking my brother who was at the time curled up with me, covering his ears. 

I told Trevor a second time, more forcefully to please stop because it really wasn’t helping the situation and he told me it wasn’t his fault my brother was upset.

I tried telling him again that my brother was special needs and he needed quiet, to which my cousin told me her brother knows that but he can’t be blamed for my brother’s meltdowns.

To her credit, she also asked Trevor to either stop yelling or turn off his game, to which he proceeded to ignore us both.

My cousin tells me I shouldn’t expect Trevor to conform to our rules, and my sister says it isn’t my brother’s fault his brain works this way.

Jane has a 9 month old girl and made me the godmother when she was born. When Jane was pregnant, we lived 8.5 hours away and I drove to visit her for her baby shower and twice after the baby was born, the latest being last month, which I had to fly for. Those drives were exhausting, as I drove Friday night and then back Sunday for work. I know this sounds bad, but I don’t particularly feel anything towards her child. I wish the best for her but I don’t love her. 

A couple months ago I moved 1,500 miles away from Jane for a job change that allows me a more flexible schedule. Due to this, I have been traveling once a month for four days with my boyfriend and checking off places that have been on our bucket list for years. 

Yesterday, Jane asked if I would attend her child’s first birthday party in a couple months. I responded no, as I wanted to be able to travel somewhere for that month. She said that I didn’t have a good reason not to go, and that I should go as I’m the godmother. 
I would rather save that time and money for other trips since I have already visited her 3 times in the past year. Jane keeps reiterating that she expects a godmother to be an active part in her child’s life and that I should prioritize her child more, but frankly I don’t want to. I understand visiting every once in a while, I regularly call and ask about the child’s well-being, but I am child free for a reason and that includes not having obligations to a child. 

I responded to her and told her that she was expecting too much out of me as her godmother, and she blew up and called me heartless.

I’m actually thinking of going limited or no contact. 

A bit of backstory. My parents divorced when I was 5 and a few years later my mum got a new boyfriend. That year my brother (17m) was killed and my sister (15f) was kidnapped. My mum couldn’t handle it and left me with her boyfriend and moved across the country. 

She went and remarried and wouldn’t let me live with her. Her husband was not a nice man and after a few years I couldn’t even visit her. 

Then, 35 years later, after raising his son, he left her and she moved back near me. She said she was dying and wanted to spend her last months with me. It’s been 5 years and I found out that was a lie. She has been awful to me, insulting and mean and my husband refuses any contact with her. 

I’m tired of leaving my family behind to go look after her but she has no other family or any friends. I don’t like her at all and she definitely doesn’t act like she likes me, but I feel obligated.

He put $10,000 into it.

Now, I’m currently attending a junior college. I haven’t touched the money, but he has helped pay for some of my tuition- estimated about $5000 of it?

Recently, he has called me and he is asking me to close the account and give him the money. It is currently at $18,000- the extra $8,000 is interest. I’ve checked the account and found that he’s made several attempts to claim ownership of the account so he could do this on his own- but he can’t, the money is legally mine. He’s even tried to claim I’m a minor to get ownership of the account (I’m over drinking age).

I think what I’d like to do is give him $10,000 since that’s what he put into it, and keep the remaining $8,000 for saving or something important down the line (like a mortgage down payment for example).

I should also add that he’s financially well off. He sold his company two years ago- there should be no reason for him to be in financial strain, unless he’s in the red.

My grandfather is a good person, I believe- he’s helped me a lot, let me stay in his home for almost a year rent free, and as noted before he paid for some of my tuition. I don’t want to “steal” from him.

But quite honestly I can't stand any of my extended family due to their pretty awful personalities/being conservative or creepy/being children and I'm pretty sick of my close family as well. The last few christmases have consisted of my mom forcing me and my siblings to do all the work to get our house ready for our extended family, which she isn't exactly nice about. This year will be even worse because we just moved into a new house and she wants to show it off when it's finally fully finished. This year I spent Thanksgiving with my partner (21 f) and their family and that week was like a breath of fresh air; being in the new house is horrible as we don't have a kitchen yet and my mom is so stressed that she's starting to take it out on everyone else, mainly me because when we argue I tend to be stubborn or sarcastic. I asked her if I could spend Christmas with my partner again and she immediately shut me down saying that I have to see my family, though I already saw them all earlier as we had an early Thanksgiving celebration and I've spent every Christmas with them since I was born. I don't want to make trouble and sometimes it's easier to fold in an argument with my mom, but it's been hellish to be around my family. For example, tonight I was told to stay home from my sister's birthday dinner because my mom bought balloons for her and put them on my stuff (we share a room), so I moved the balloons and my mom blew up at me, telling me I don't care about anyone but myself.

When one member of the group showed up an hour before the assignment was due, I was irate and reported that he only contributed 5% of the assignment in the peer review form. He had offered no assistance throughout the entire assignment, his absence had increased our workloads, and we had lost points because we hadn't been able to get everyone's data. 

To make a long story short, he messaged me for help after failing the course and telling me that it ruined his day. 

I feel like a complete tool for having told the truth; I should have given him some credit to make sure he didn't fail.

My mom loved telling everyone she was a girl mom. She talked about being a girl mom was her dream come true. I was often left at home while she had her girls days. There was never a mom and son day. A few times she was able to look me in the eye and tell me she forgot I was there if I spoke. There was never any shame in it.

My (m32) wife (f33) have been married for 3+ years. We recently had a premature baby. He is doing great and we and most of the family could not be happier.

I will layout 3 events that happened during the pregnancy that lead me to believe my BIL/SIL are toxic.

Background: BIL and SIL are older 38/39 and have been married for close to a decade with no kids. They never shared their struggles of having kids or what steps they have taken prior to us getting pregnant. SIL had no living family close by and BIL’s family along with my wife and I are super close.

1st Event: Wife and I took a trip, come back, and, after several pregnancy tests, confirm we are having a baby. Knowing our BIL/SIL don’t have kids, but also have not shared anything about their struggles, we decide to tell our parents and then them next. We did this at BIL’s parents house after a nice day together. We let them know that we wanted to let them know first because we love them and want to be considerate of their feelings. We did not want them to see it social media or from another family member.

Immediately, they look somber. Give us both a lackluster hug then leave the house. 

2nd Event: No contact from either of them for the first 6 months of my wife’s pregnancy. No “how are you?” Nothing. 

They invite us to dinner. We reluctantly go. Dinner is all small talk. As we go to leave, SIL decides to tell us that she’s been harboring resentment and apologized for past indiscretions from before my wife and I  were together. My wife struggled to even remember what she was talking about since it was almost a decade ago. 

We left, no apology for the lack of communication during her pregnancy.

3rd Event: Our baby came early due to my wife’s preeclampsia. It was a traumatic situation but thankfully he came out naturally. He was small but healthy. Family that we’re close all came except for them. 

The next day, they did come (they live 30min away). My wife took her brother in to meet with the baby. While she was in there, my SIL decided to share with everyone that she and my BIL would be getting his sperm checked after Thanksgiving. She then went into how sad she is about not being able to have a kid and how lonely it feels. 

My fucking baby is in the NICU and she shares this now?

They didn’t check his jizz yet? That’s like the first step. 

I’m sorry if this is incoherent. I’m pissed, maybe a little sauced.

     Me and my girlfriend of nearly 3 years have recently been getting more serious in our relationship up to the point where I’m now starting to look at rings to propose to her quite soon. Despite having minor problems in our relationship, like any couple would, there’s never been an instance in which I had to question her integrity. Prior to getting together, we even established what was expected of one another in this relationship, thoroughly talked about our past relationships and how we’d resolve/avoid any possible errors we didn’t want to repeat.

     Ironically enough, my biggest issue in my past relationships was the lack of trust. I’ve had exes who would constantly desire to go through my phone, nitpick “reasons” to be upset and make the overall relationship a miserable situation to be in. Therefore, I personally told my current girlfriend that I’d never do this to her as I know just how shitty it can be. 
     
     As the relationship went on from that initial conversation, we’d developed the habit of calling each other out if something the other said made either one of us uncomfortable whether that be from a past trauma or in general. One thing that always grabbed my attention, but I never called out was how highly she randomly talk to me about other guys. I often dismissed this because my girlfriend is a bit tomboyish when it comes to dressing up and some of her favorite hobbies (playing video games and football), so naturally she’s never really had a lot of female friends. Whenever she’d mention some of her male friends, however, she’d do so with this suggestive undertone…if that makes sense?
    
     This led me to believe they were something going on between the select few names she’d do this to but I used to just think I was overreacting because that’s what I’ve been told in past relationships despite being proven otherwise. Therefore, I’ve swept this under the rug many times before, but as I was sitting down thinking about how I’d propose I got a gut feeling to check her phone as she was sleeping. I’d never done this before, and felt so guilty for even having such a thought cross my mind, but there’s only been very few times my gut instinct was wrong. Upon unlocking the phone and going to Snapchat, I found out that I was right just by looking at some of the saved photos that she sent/received.
     
     Now these photos weren’t sent during the span of our relationship so I couldn’t necessarily be upset with those. My problem is that she’s been promoting these guys to me as “friends” and still actively talks to them and to me about them as if nothing had ever went on between them. This has me conflicted because now I feel more like one of her options as opposed to the “love of her life.” I don’t know how I plan on bringing this up to her because despite what I’ve found out, I feel like what I did was wrong.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4843043,public,top,self,AITA For snooping through my girlfriend’s phone and finding out she’s still in touch with her exes?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9iiop/aita_for_snooping_through_my_girlfriends_phone/,all_ads,6,,,,

Im in college (19yo) and my parents are paying full tuition ($50k/year). My family are US citizens living in a country with no tax treaty with the US (i.e. we have to pay local taxes no matter if we pay US taxes or not).

Im from a frugal middle class family with good saving. My parents (55yo, living outside of US) have substantial unreported assets\* (from abroad work not reported to the IRS), but not enough for retirement.

Most US college scholarships/grants/aid application (even some merit based) needs a household tax return AND report of income+savings.

My parent’s US tax return shows a very low income and 0 savings (because they didn’t report any of their abroad income/savings)

**Plan 1: report the lower “offical tax return wealths” will get me 45k financial aid.** It would save a lot for my parents but I will be taking money from someone that may actually need the financial aid. Moreover I went to a 15k/year private high school so reporting as low income may raise suspicion from the school and even trigger audits. Also I would have a hard time signing the “*this application is accurate to the best of my knowledge*” box.

**Plan 2: report the “actual wealths” will get me 10k financial aid.** Being honest means my application will not match the US tax returns. Some sources say federal student aid cannot be disbursed until the conflict is resolved by filing a accurate federal tax return. Also, my parents worry their tax evasion getting caught despite the US Department of Education claims they *currently* don’t share data with the IRS.

**Plan 3: pay full tuition.** Everyone will be happy except my parent’s wallet.

My parents don’t feel any guilt from evading US taxes because “they are paying local taxes and are not using any US infrastructure/benefits”. I think this is wrong. But i’m just a kid who never had to worry about money. I went with plan 3 thinking that I did the ""right thing."" I thought they deserved this for evading taxes. Plus, I can repay them in 5 to 10 years after graduation. I received some merit-based scholarships and have a part time job (only covering 20% of tuition).

However my dad recently lost his job and lots of money in the stocks market, and is trying to start a business now meaning we are very tight on cashflow. My dad is still somewhat supportive and tells me he will pay my tuition not matter what, but paying full tuition will really limit his options when starting the buisness. Moreover I have a sister also going to college in 2024 and she doesn’t have a college fund yet.

**AITA? WIBTA if I apply for financial aid now?** I don’t want to lie to pretend to be low income and take financial aid from others, but I also don’t want to impose my morality at the expense of my dad’s opportunity to start a buisness/retire and my sister's college choices.

I’ve been dog sitting for my friends family for years now. I’ve always had a friend or two over when I did it. I started dog sitting for my friends family on Thanksgiving night.

I’m in the Bay Area, so high cost of living area so I charged them $20 a dog at $60 a day. I just finished last night so the total was $360. 

Btw I dropped and picked my friend up from the airport both times which took another two hours both times and I walked the big dog a bunch. 

I asked her if I charged her family too much because I’m not assertive at all. And she said no she doesn’t know. Later, I mentioned who had been over and her brother knew. Then I asked again later if she thought I charged too much, and she said “well you had hella people over, so I wouldn’t want to pay you that much.” I was in shock because I thought that was okay and I never left their home for more than 3 hours at a time if I did even leave.

I was in the chips aisle when a child (like 8 or 9 years old) poked me in the leg. I turned and just said “Excuse me” She seemed to have some difficulty with speech and just pointed at one of the packs in the upper shelf.I assumed that she wanted that pack and couldn’t reach it so I grabbed it and gave it to her. I realised that I had never tried that flavour so I grabbed one for myself as well.I assumed that was it and turned around. But she poked me again. She seemed annoyed and was shaking her head. I thought that she wanted a different flavour so I began pointing at different flavours but she then started pointing at the pack in my cart. I asked her if she wanted to switch packs but she shook her head. She just kept pointing at the pack. I honestly didn’t want the headache so I gave it to her, grabbed another one from the shelf and started walking towards checkout. But the kid kept following me. I stopped and turned around. I was slightly annoyed and also a bit concerned that this kid had now been wandering around for a while. I walked up to one of the employees and told them that there was an unattended child there. She asked the kid to come with her to find her parents. But the kid refused to go with her. She grabbed on to my cart and refused to let go. The employee asked me if I could wait there while she went and found this kid’s parents. I was frustrated by this time but asked her to do it quickly. She came back with a lady with two strollers. The lady saw that her kid was grabbing my cart and I have no idea why but she freaked out. She rushed and picked up her daughter and started calling me a predator who was trying to kidnap her daughter. She said I was evil for trying to prey on a disabled child who didn’t understand that strangers like me were bad. I was just very shocked and didn’t know what to say so I asked the employee to explain the situation to her. Before the employee could explain anything, she noticed that I had the same chips in my cart as the ones as the ones her daughter was holding. She started yelling saying that I was using those to lure her. I was ducking pissed as this point so I just let her have it. I yelled at her telling her that she was a negligent parent who let her daughter wander around unaccompanied. I told her that I was merely trying to help her daughter find her parents and that I had grabbed the chips for her because she had asked me to do so. Now here’s where I might have started being the asshole. I told her that just because she was a bad mother didnt mean that everyone else in the world was a bad person. I told her to duck off and walked out of the store. Today, I told my sister what happened and she told me that I had gone too far in calling her a bad mother.

 Most of the time I don’t like being touched in general and I make it very clear that I don’t ever want to be touched for no reason or if I’m caught by surprise. 

 People, especially family members, still look hurt when I avoid unnecessary/extra physical contact or am visibly uncomfortable because of it, especially hugs. It’s starting to make me kinda think I’m just overreacting since I act that way towards family members too.

I have known both guys for a long long time and we hang out all the time, Aaron I have known for 8 years and Bill for 14. We are renewing the contract on our flat, except Aaron is leaving, he is being replaced by another friend Charlie.

Aaron is moving out and taking all his stuff, including the TV in the living room. He has however offered to sell us it for £250 (300$ish I think). I was a bit taken aback that he wanted us to pay that much for it so I'll just add some context why:

1) he didn't pay anything for it, it was his dad's old TV
2) he's moving back to his parents, then he's moving abroad and not taking it so it will literally be collecting dust somewhere if we don't take it and we use it all the time

The price he's asking is a little bit less than full price if we were to buy a new one. I did try to ask it down a little but Bill kept interrupting me to say he'd ""never haggle with friends"" undermining my point and making me feel like I'm being a dick.

Maybe I've lost perspective here but under the circumstances, with people I know that well, with an item I was already gifted for free thats already set up and getting good use that I wouldn't be able to use until 2024 minimum I would treat it more like passing the favour along, either free or maybe £100 if insisted.

Rosie was 5 when Jamie died. He was diagnosed with a heart condition months before and was in a bad way by the time diagnosis came. So he knew his death was coming but had hoped he could get a transplant in time. Jamie had no family, he was a foster kid as long as I knew him, but we became brothers through our friendship. I was closer to him than my biological brothers. When he knew no heart was coming to save him he asked me to look out for Rosie and to be there for her in his place. He knew I adored Rosie and he knew I would talk to Rosie about him, that I would help her keep his memory alive.

So I did. We are still close today. She adores my husband and I as much as we adore her. So she asked me to act as father of the bride in her wedding. She said it would be the closest thing to having her dad there. She also plans to pin a photo of him into the flowers she carries down the aisle.

Where the problem comes in is her stepdad. He has been in her life since she was 6 (my sister met him 10 months after Jamie died, started dating him after 6 months of knowing him and introduced them immediately). He and my sister are not very happy that she asked me, her uncle, over her ""other dad"" and they are unhappy with me. They say I prevented Rosie from having another dad and that my being so present with Rosie and allowing her to talk so much about her dad left no room for Jamie to fill in the father role. That he has been in her life for 18 years now and it's still not enough for him to be FOTB.

Rosie apologized to me for getting any trouble over this. She told me she couldn't think of a living person she would have over me and that this is what she wants because her stepdad is not her dad. I told her as long as she's happy with her decision it changes nothing for me.

But her stepdad will not let up and he told me I should be encouraging her to ask him and that I am disrespecting him and all he did for her. That he was there longer than Jamie and the fact he still takes priority over him to her, even in this, and that I am going along with it, pisses him off. He called me an asshole and said I denied Rosie another father.

Constant lurker, first time poster. Appreciate any insights on this as struggling to reach a consensus between the two of us.

My fiancee (F36) and I (M28) live together in a small but lovely one bed apartment. My sister (F25) has moved to our town for a job and staying on our couch for a few weeks while she finds her feet.

Basically she found a new place but couldn't move in as soon as we hoped. She'll have been with us for 8 weeks instead of the 4-5 weeks we initially expected. She's working full time in an office (my gf and I are both WFH) so we only interact for a couple of hours on the evening and she's been a conscientious guest. There's no beef between her and my gf either, they get on really well. However gf is feeling the lack of space and wants the place to ourselves again, asking me to tell sister to sort another place for the final week before she moves into another flat.

I'm at a loss here bc a week seems like a very short amount of time to make her up and move in with another friend/relative before moving again, especially while working full time. I get where gf is coming from (we're both neurodivergent with some sensory issues and appreciate our own quiet space to ourselves) but don't want to make this transition harder for my little sister and don't see what she's meant to do especially since she's been a great guest (which gf agrees with). I'm not sure if I need to knuckle down to make my sister sort something or prioritise my girlfriend's mental health.

He has always favored my (10m) brother because it was his actual child and not one that he adopted from my mother. Prior to this I had moved back in with him after an argument that happened a year ago because I confronted him about his favoritism. Him and his girlfriend/fiancé have been texting me and my mother saying how upset and disappointed he is in me. For right now we are no contact. He has accused me of stealing from him (which I have never done) and being disrespectful to his family who doesn’t like me. He has said that I am growing up to be a terrible person and other mean things. When I did live with him he would say nasty comments on people being very obese now a days and limit snacks because I just wanna eat it because my brother was eating it at the time. He would also say his fiancé was obese when i’m the same size as her. I’m only 108 pounds. He has caused me to be very self conscious about myself but I can’t help but feel sad that we never formed a daughter-father bond. I feel like I have given him enough chances but at the same time I still want a relationship with him.

For context, we are drastically different people: he's a chill person, satisfied with his everyday life, and loves me very much. I, on the other hand, am a person that deals with depression and a deep, very painful loneliness, that's mainly due to the fact that I have always had ""weird"" interests (spirituality, philosophy to name a few) that make me feel out of place and without a clear reason on why I should be living at all. I am also very unable to form ""normal"" friendship since I generally avoid social events and can't relate very well with people of the same age (one of my very few friends is an 80 yrs old lady). However, one of the very few things that is clear to me is that I love him endlessly. The problem: my bf introduced me to one of his closest friends that he's had since childhood, saying that we would've gone along well. He's very intellectual, reads a lot, and it's clear to me that we are very, very similar: so we started writing long letters to each other about literature, music and religion, not before me asking my bf if that would've been fine (I would never do stuff behind his back). For me it was nothing more that an intellectual bond between two people that could never find another person ""like them"", and it made me feel less out of place in the world (I made clear with the friend that I am in love with bf). Some weeks later my bf tells me that he feels excluded and treated like an idiot; we fight, and he decides to write to his friend for the first time since it all started (they don't live in the same city and write to each other just occasionally). His friend breaks things off with him (friendship of 30 years) and is concerned about me suffering. It is now clear to me that he is in love with me, a thing that I didn't even consider because a) my bf was his best friend and b) he's never, never been interested in women and only lived to read/study. AITA for unknowingly giving him the wrong signals and betraying my bf's trust? Have I been manipulated by him (like my bf says) and our conversation has never been as innocent as I thought? Am I allowed to grieve the loss of our friendship (because that's what's going to happen since I want to stay with bf) that meant so much for me and that I know was so rare that I am never going to find it again in this life?

I love him dearly, but it became clear that he's really bad with making arrangements with friends. He would double book often. And not even accidentally, he's aware of clashing plans, but will just believe that it will all work out or he'll end up canceling on someone. 

I don't like this. I feel it's disrespectful towards many people's time. When his plans involves me and our friends, he'd usually expect me to help come up with a solution or damage control. Early in our relationship I used to help. But as time went on I realized that I am enabling this behavior and I pulled back in this regard a bit.

So a month ago he invited me to a dinner with one of his associates. He wanted me to meet him. I was really excited and said of course! I asked him about the date and he said it will be in December. He doesn't know yet when precisely, but he'll let me know. I was like... ""Uhm...okay, you'll let me know in time, right? I don't want to double book again.""

He got annoyed and said he will. I've asked him several times in between and each time he got annoyed and told me to stop worrying. 

So this week bf, me and some of our mutual friends booked a day out at a local theme park. Our one friend is leaving the country soon and she's never been there before. We're all working that day, so we'll only get to the park at about 3pm. Well today my bf told me that our plans are clashing, and that our dinner with his associate is the same day as our theme park day. 

I asked him how this happened. And again, he confessed that he knew of the dates and that it was at the back of his mind, but that he thought it would be okay. I told him that I will absolutely not be ditching our friends again. And that I can't figure how he thought it would be okay, since his associate is literally an hour away from us (without traffic). 

His mother heard about this (I assumehe vented), and is calling me inconsiderate and mean. She said the associate dinner was arranged a month ago, and that it's unreasonable of me to drop him for plans I made a week ago.

For more context on her situation, her ex bf made her quit her job, isolated her from friends and family, abused her when she would make him mad. Obviously she needs to get out of her place asap so, i offered her to live with us in a 2bed apartment. My bf is fine with this.

The reason i dont want his cousin to move in is because, hes a terrible guy when it comes to women. Hes unfortunately my best friends type and i feel they would get romantically or sexually involved which i would not be comfortable with because he would:

1. Cheat (he has on almost every gf he has had) 
2. Neglect and hurt her 
3. He has to go back to his province anyways so shed get hurt no matter what. 

I told my boyfriend if he moves in i will move out with my bestfriend and find somewhere else to live. Hes telling me its not fair that my bestfriend can move in with us but not his cousin, even though its not a comparable situation at all. He has a home and a family.

I’m super to myself most of the time, and it’s pretty well-known that I’m more of a  “distant” type of person, so I honestly just wanted to save myself the headache of having to communicate with that many people.

Now, my father/his side of the family and I don’t have a relationship whatsoever. He and my mom had me as teens and weren’t together after I was born.

I am back for a couple week to visit my family so I am staying in my old room. Turns out my brother, rigged parts of my room so when I go to say, open a drawer, something either explodes or makes a loud noise to the point where it scares me half to death. 

Something you should know about me, loud noises startle the shit out of me and I get jumpy for days after. So I tend to get irritated after being exposed to them. 

Anyway, it got to the point where I could not sleep out of restlessness and fear of being pranked again, even at night (yes he has pranked me on several occasions at night). The next day I asked him if he could go into my room and disarm any rigged pranks, so I could finally get some peace. The conversation ended with a sibling fight, “no’s” and “yes’s “ got thrown back and forth. Eventually he agreed after my mother got in the middle. 

When he was in my room, I started to come up with a planned prank, knowing it had to be big or nothing at all. I decided that I would turn on a horror movie that night since he would always be extremely uncomfortable and spooked. Wait about an hour or two after the movie, while everyone was either asleep or just in their rooms to dress up as the “big bad” character in movie and scare the shit out of him. 

I informed my parents of the prank so they would not worry about any loud noises since it would be around 10:00pm at night. 

I heard my brother leave his room and go downstairs, so I ran into his room and hide by his window and gaming desk, completely hidden from him, slightly behind the curtain. 

Hearing his footsteps come up the stairs I was ready to spring out and scare him but wanted to wait for the perfect moment. My brother turn out the lights and got into bed. I waited about five minutes or so before I started to move and get into place at the side of his bed with his back towards me. 

I pulled the covers back just a little bit and lean down to blow air on his back to get a reaction out of him before I started with making noises like the character did. 

My brother turned around and started to squeal
so loud while flailing around in his bed. I just did what anyone would have done in that moment, start to grab him and increase my lovely scary noises. 

My dad ended up coming in to see what happen so the lights were turned on revealing me in a costume and my brother beet red. 

Little bro could not handle being scared so he started to yell at me and got up out of his bed allowing everyone in the room to see a huge wet spot on his bed. 

Yes, you guessed it. He pissed himself…

Our family have been in a homeless house for 4 years and I've had to share a bunk bed with my younger sister. (It's done wonders for my back....)

I'm (22f) and work a 10 hour shift Monday - Friday as an early years teacher. I have TONS of work to do every single day. My older brother (24) spends endless amount of time sitting in front of his computer straight after his work. He is a labourer and has a 6 hour shift.

We've been offered a house. My mum views it and takes videos to show me. The place is HUGE and amazing! My 2 little sisters are sharing a room that can fit 3 double beds inside. My parents have a room.  My brother has a room that can also fit 3 double beds inside. He also has a walk in cupboard that can LITERALLY hold another double bed, it's that huge!

And I've got an attic room. It holds a single bed that takes up the entire room if you tilt it diagonally so it'll fit. 

I think I'm the asshole because it's a room and I should be grateful to have something. There's people out there without rooms.

I don't think I'm the asshole because i've literally been shoved in an attic. I have my bachelors to study for and afterwards, my masters. I really wanted to save for a desk and computer for a work space but that's just not gonna work. My brother is supposed to be encouraged to move out and offering him that room is just motivation for him to stay. 

Yes, he's the golden child.

(they also talk about ships like eg: shigaraki x deku. or i think like dabi x todoroki. they also talk about burning their school down and they find it funny when they harass people while wearing said maid costume after the person says they find it uncomfortable. and i know this sounds petty in a way but it makes me very uncomfortable to think of a minor and an adult being in a relationship even in a fictional universe)

Okay, I'm gonna make this short and quick so people can keep moving on their life, about two years ago, I was 14 and still didn't know how to ride a bicycle (pretty embarassing I know). My mom's friend said she could convice her son to teach me cycling, and so I did, we met at the park and started to learn the basics, but soon I was distracted because my friends had a electric scooter, I have never rode one before and when I did, I absolutely fell in love, at the end of that day, My mom told me that if I learned how to ride a bicycle, She'd get me a e-scooter.

Two weeks later, I already knew how to ride a bike since I was a pretty quick learner, I told my mom that when would she buy the scooter and she said until my dad comes back (He was working overseas)

Fast forward to two years later, I am now 16 and kinda mastered how to ride a bike 101, I mentioned about the scooter thing again (My dad was here this time) and both of them said no, I asked why and they said I was too fat and clumsy because last week I tripped on the bike's wheel and fell, I said that it was because the road had some crappy condition, then they mentioned several reasons not to get one such as ""It will explode while charging"" or ""You don't have a place to use it"", I said it wasn't a problem and then my mom said ""Is a normal scooter ok?"" which of course I said no, then she said ""She regret promising this"" and I was like ""If it wasn't for this I would have never broke a bone just to learn biking"", we stoped arguing and the day ended, I was still mad for what she promised &amp; never excecuted her promise

E(F18), and M(F18), also live on my floor, middle and on the opposite side of me respectively. M in particular has a roommate who is never around, so she has been the subject of a few noise complaints (loud tv, loud sex etc.) that were handled by me or other floor mates just knocking on her door and asking her to be quiet.
Tonight, M had two male friends around, which never usually bothers me, except this time they were talking in the hallway loudly at 11:30pm. I told them to please quiet down, because they were bothering my roommate, and I went back into my room. A few minutes later, I go into the bathroom to get ready for bed, and I come out to hear yelling. M and one of her friends are sitting in the middle of the hallway, where E's room is, and the other is standing over them, being cussed out by E. I tell them to be quiet again. E swears at me and slams her door, so I tell everyone to just shut up and I go back to my room.
A few minutes go by and they're still being loud in the hallway, and I am pretty fed up at this point, so I peek my head out again and tell M to take whatever conversation they are having to her room cause the walls are thin and she's being loud. I went back to my room and decided to try and tune them out, but then my roommate says, ""M is talking about you in the hallway.” I start to listen and M says, ""She can't talk to me like that. She's not my mother."" This angered me, cause not only was she not listening to me, she was misgendering me as well.
I decided to call the RA on duty for the night for a noise complaint. I hear the hallway door open and the RA telling the group to quiet down. The door opens again and I look out and someone else had called Campus Police. The group lies and says it wasn't them. When they come in my direction, I say that they're lying and that they were the ones being loud. Campo warns them, the group retreats into M's room, and I think the situation is settled.
A few minutes later, I go to use the bathroom and M and E are in there. They both go silent. I walk passed them, but before I went into the stall, I said, ""I wasn't the one who called campo."" M says she doesn't care, then mumbles something under her breath. I say, ""What?"" and she said it was nothing, so I went into the stall. And then I hear her say, ""I just think it's crazy how everyone else can be loud, but once the two black people do it...""
M and E are 2/3 of the black women on our ""all girls"" floor, and I am white. I didn’t respond to her, but I honestly just think she was pulling that card, because they firmly believe they weren't in the wrong.

It is more common in cosmopolitan cities like Mumbai (where i have lived until recently and never had to face such issue) but where i am currently at, it is not so. 
My problem with the whole situation is the assumption people make just because of my age and the consequent headache i have to deal with with regards to documents, if any.

Been together for 5. Overall a happy marriage. No kids, live 40 mins away from family. love each other &amp; express it often

Husband is super emotional and sort of a mama’s boy. His mom’s over all chill and I’ve never had a problem with her. She’s always been loving towards me too. However, I feel his fam’s very needy about our time. Mainly his but also mine. We work a 9-5 (from home) and have a side businesses so mostly always busy. we usually take vacations every month to unwind and enjoy.

Husband’s mom &amp; step dad were not getting along after our marriage on multiple occasions because of conflicts b/w my MIL and FIL’s family. my Husband was mad at step-dad so he went NC for more than a year. During this time there were some moments where husband was too stressed because of a potential divorce and his mom not getting financially compensated from her husband the way she deserves. Step-dad fell sick the past few months so husband was majorly stressed too at first for divorce and then for FIL’s financial decisions. Well, now that’s resolved as he added MIL to his will and got been diagnosed with a terminal disease. My husband &amp; him have now mended their relationship. We have been visiting every day (40 min one way) during the busiest season, and when I don’t visit I get to hear “Oh we miss you”. We don’t do much besides sitting and chatting, where I could use that time to catch up on ALL the pending work that’s time sensitive. 

All the trips we recently took were with my husband super stressed (including my bday trip 2 months ago, at that time they were worried about the divorce, not sickness) I planned another trip in Nov (which I paid for fully) now rescheduled to next week. Husband’s feeling guilty that his mom will be alone. I feel bad for wanting to go but I feel I’m tired of holding off on my life, if something bad happens we will fly back right away &amp; I feel i have been always compromising on my fun since we got married because of something or the other in my husband’s family (including me neglecting work for 2 weeks when his uncle was in the hospital) 
I paid a good chunk of money for this 3 day trip. I have been visiting them daily to keep company, neglecting my own work and parents (my parents live close by but prefer i prioritize sick step dad first)
I just feel I’ve done a lot and I deserve 3 stress free days. But MIL will make herself feel weak and alone (she’s not, her own mom &amp; sibling live 10 min away) and I just don’t know if I’m TA. I feel I want to prioritize me, I’ve been giving too much. But am I being selfish?

I dont have a problem at all with FIL either, he’s been nice to me always, but I can’t visit him everyday, he’s barely even in his senses now for the most part",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4842928,public,,self,AITA if I (F25)still want to go on a trip when FIL’s sick,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9h4pv/aita_if_i_f25still_want_to_go_on_a_trip_when_fils/,all_ads,6,,,,

This is about Me F(24) and M(24) friend we first got to know each other when we met in our engineering college and clicked I loved talking to everyone back then now I am a changed person.

I had a great bond with my best friend and he is a great person too as time passed by I understood he had feelings for me but he never confessed so I let the friendship thrive. During the pandemic he confessed to me about his feelings to which I respectfully denied.

The bond we shared remaided normal for a while but then he started behaving distant I couldn't understand I tried speaking to him no response finally one day he told me he never wants to talk to me again atleast for a year or two.

But this year was the worst years of my life. I had to leave my house stay alone in the pandemic, faced depression got an eating disorder, found out he had been posting indirect coments for me on his instagram through a common friend.

Now I am moving on went to gym, got my eating habits on track got into an healthy reationship with the guy I loved and now my best friend came back .

He called me on my phone, pinged me on intagram, and texted me on whatsapp as well all in a day.He expects us to go back to what we were exactly the same things the way we had fun how outgoing we were how supportive we were everything.

AITA for not agreeing to this, I am no more the person who wanted to go out everysingle chance she got. No more childish in my mind nothing. The fact that I am worried about is also that how do you unlove someone and wouldn't letting him back allow him to get his feelings back too. I have lost a lot of friends these past years wouldn't want to loose anymore.

What if he gets his feelings back and leaves again,I'm not sure if I am ready to accept this again.Yes I am worried how this will affect my relationship as we are a long distance couple.

I told her my weight, which is 130 lbs. She then gasped and was like '130 lbs?! That's huge! On my wedding day I weighed 110 lbs!' as also said 'David (my fiance) isn't even going to be able to carry you up those stairs! (there is a small staircase with about 10 steps up to our bedroom). I had felt pretty good about how I looked up until then but she commented that I should 'go on a diet immediately'. I started to get really insecure and frustrated with her, so I said 'Mom, I am 5'9. You aren't even 5'4. I'm obviously going to be heavier because I'm taller than you. And besides, you're the one that's overweight. Maybe you should be the one to go on a diet.' She then proceeded to get very upset and left right after. My mom is super insecure about her weight, and has been told by doctors for years to lose it for health reasons. She half-heartedly tries but then makes excuses like 'My metabolism is much slower now' 'I'm too busy to lose weight' 'I'm skinnier than my friends' etc. Despite this, it's obvious she gets upset about it. That's fine with me and none of my business, but I do feel super bad for body-shaming her especially since I know she struggles. AITA?

His girlfriend just asked me if I had any thoughts or feelings about them getting a dog and I replied with. 

""i don't have any particularly hard feelings other then dogs are alot of work and theres already alot of animals in the house. so just worried you guys might get overwhelmed? guess it depends on the size of the dog as well but thats all for you guys to figure out and deal with and not really a me issue? if u guys feel u can handle it then it wouldnt really bother me or anything.""

So some background info these two barely do adult things like cleaning the house or getting groceries I've basically stayed in my basement for the 5 years I've lived here because his girlfriend really makes me anxious/unnerved they are entirely co dependent on each other, they don't leave the house and spend in my opinion way to much time together (she's now getting a job where him and I work and he moved his computer room upstairs so she felt less Lonely?)

They don't do dishes unless stuff is literally piled everywhere, the house most times smells like cat piss they leave cardboard everywhere instead of just walking 10 steps outside to throw it in the recycling bin. They rarely do yard work until it's so unsightly that it begins to look bad. 

Anyway I've recently gotten help with my anixety issues and decided to start coming upstairs to make food and she suggested we take turns cooking for each other which is working out fine except I have to do all the grocery shopping because neither of them want to/get anxious doing it? That's fine I don't have an issue doing that the issue comes when they are trying to save money to buy the house we are living in and they basically live on delivery food so we decided to buy food and cook for each other but when it's her week she just orders food anyway for us all and then I just send her the money or she makes her boyfriend cook she's cooked maybe 3 times in the 2 months since we started this they live paycheck to paycheck and are constantly spending money on stuff packages at the door all the time or some video game skin or what not and then get worried about not being able to save money and now they want to get a dog on top of that..

She got mad at me for giving my opinion when she asked... We have things in the house that are breaking like the washer machine leaks.

Me and my best friend live in different countries, and she has a boyfriend who I heavily dislike because of how he is towards her. It started when me and her became friends. Yes I had developed feelings for her, but I valued our friendship more. We had quite a lot of fun together, until in one online game her boyfriend joined seeing us play together. After that they both got into a fight about her, and he told her she had to unfriend me.

Just as more time progressed she told me more things about her partner, the stuff he did to her:  
\- Threatening to end the relationship  
\- Forcing her to choose between him or a friend  
\- Not giving her much care and love  
\- Not showing the attention she needs  
\- More time with his friends than her

and some other things I'd like to add to the list of how he is:  
\- Forceful  
\- Manipulative  
\- And he is consumed by his jealousy.

He is one of the causes she loses some male friends, even ones she cares for.

I know the title sounds simple, but there’s more to it that that. I’m going to try to be as impartial as possible, and all I ask is for your judgement. 

I (25m) have been with my girlfriend (22f) for over 2 years. We both work similar schedules full time which thankfully makes it a little easier to spend time together while living together. Usually after work we’ll eat and watch a show together. Outside of that I like to game, browse Reddit, and read. Meanwhile she usually likes to watch TikTok. 

I don’t mind her having her own time to watch TikTok, nor does it bother me the amount that she does. However I don’t have any interest in the app myself. I’ve tried to get into it with her but I just can’t, and I’ve expressed this a few times. I don’t mind laying down to watch a handful with her every once and awhile. Heck I actually enjoy watching the ones that she sends me to watch together because I appreciate that she took the time to think of me. But I just can’t stand the constant shopping hauls, tutorials, and other things on her FYP. I’d much rather spend my time reading, or playing on my switch next to her if she wants to be in the same room. 

Tonight she said she wanted to watch TikTok and I offered to grab my book and read in bed with her if she wanted, and she said she wanted me to watch. I told her I don’t mind and we can do that. (I did genuinely mean that I didn’t mind, but I know I didn’t sound enthusiastic about it) and she got upset and said never mind. I told her that I don’t mind, I enjoy laying down with you, but TikTok really doesn’t interest me and id rather lay down and do something else. 

She’s upset and hasn’t said a word to me since. I tried explaining what I’ve said above and nothing. 

So I’m coming here to ask AITA?

I'm the breadwinner while he is the primary care giver for our daughter. Our schedules work for the most part but I really need more time to decompress. I'm a lawyer while my husband works in academic research. Our days start by me getting up around 7 to get breakfast ready and my daughter would wake up around 7:30. I will feed her and then go take a bath together. My husband would be up by 8:30am and he will be dressed and ready by 9 as I leave. I try to finish work till 5-6 but end up usually finishing by 7:30-8pm on good days. 

During this time, my husband cleans up the house, makes lunch and dinner, drops of lunch for me and runs his errands for the house. He also plays and takes care of our daughter while also teaching her both our native languages. He will get some of his work for his job that he can do remotely done when she takes her naps. He will leave for work around 6:30, his work is walking distance from our place while mine is a drive away. Since, I'm often not able to make it home, our daughter will be with either his mother, my sister or our neighbor who also has a 2-year-old. This puts additional pressure on my plate to get home quicker to relieve these people from this additional duty. My work already required me to work twice as hard as most of my counterparts because this is such a high-pressure job with a lot of internalized sexism. I had cut my maternity leave short and come back early because my coworkers warned me about how people were eying my clients and position. Just to prove myself, I had to work even harder. 

When I get home, I'm burnt out. I don't get any time to decompress really as I have to take care of my daughter as soon as I get back until her bedtime at 9. I'd then finish whatever little work I can which I had to abandon to get home in time. By 10 I'm spent and just crash in my bed and maybe get an hour to myself until I fall asleep. My husband will come back around 12-12:30am and fall asleep. 

This was working but I'm spent. I can't do this anymore. If my husband quits his job, I won't have the extra pressure to rush home nor would I have to wake up early and take care of our daughter right away. I'd also be able to get at least some time to myself. His job doesn't really pay as much and mostly covers his personal expenses and a few bills which my salary can easily cover. I pay for most of the stuff here and it's important that I am able to work at my best for that salary

I had a conversation with him where he was very defensive and didn't want to quit as its fulfilling and has been his dream for a long time despite it not being practical at this point in life and well out of frustration, I called his job a hobby since it doesn't pay much and doesn't really contribute to the household. I know it was harsh but at the end of the day it is the truth. He's not been his cheery self for a few days now and is barely talking to me.

I’m (22M) into learning languages, it is a hobby I have, I can speak four languages by now and learning a fifth. So recently some friends and family gathered to watch a Football match at the World Cup, Spain vs Germany, my sister’s bf and my bf also joined to watch the match. 

As the match was getting more interesting, we started talking about some players from both countries and I mentioned some like: Mario Götze, Thomas Müller, Leon Goretza, Manuel Neuer, Lukas Klostermann etc. At this point I was speaking Spanish and wasn’t pronouncing the names “correctly” as if it was German because that’s nonsense, I mean I was speaking Spanish, and pronouncing names in another languages is just weird, so I just pronounce it as a Spanish speaking person would do it and in a way that it makes sense in the language since some German phonetics don’t exist In Spanish. I do this with other languages too, If I’m speaking French and I have to say an English name or place I say it as it makes sense in the language even if I know the “correct” way. My favourite is when I have to say “Wocestershire sauce” in a foreign language, it sounds funny. 

So as I stated above, my sister’s BF was and he started “correcting me” to show me how to pronounce the player’s names  correctly (he got them all wrong), I didn’t say anything the first few times because I was just enjoying the match, but then he became so annoying correcting me at every German word I said. He didn’t know I speak German, I speak 4 languages but I don’t usually go telling everyone, so as I was tired of his behavior, I told him: 

*Ich hatte keine Ahnung dass Du Deutsch sprichst, Velleicht Können Wir einmal üben damit Du mir helfen Kannst, meine Aussprache zu verbessen.* Which means: *I had no idea you speak German, maybe we get to practice once so you help me improve my pronunciation.* I know my German isn’t perfect but I certainly know way more than him. 

He didn’t get a word because he doesn’t speak the language and my sister looked at me pissed, so our other friends started laughing at him and he seemed really pissed, my BF (who was also tired of his attitude and comes from Austria btw) started speaking German to me and we exchanged some words. The match ended and everyone left, he also left but my sister was mad at me for humiliating him and she told me that he was mad because I should’ve told him I speak German so he wouldn’t have looked like a loser. 

I swear, I didn’t do it to humiliate him, I was just tired of his attitude and wanted him to stop and I thought it was the only way (it worked) but I’m also refusing to apologise as my sister wants me to because he is the one who started this was him.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4842858,public,top,self,AITA for speaking a language just to shut my sister’s bf up?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9gh87/aita_for_speaking_a_language_just_to_shut_my/,all_ads,6,,,,

I (49M) have been working as a high school teacher for about a decade. My ex gf (19F) says I should quit because I ""groomed"" her. For some context: she was a student of mine when she was about 14-15 years old, but I didn't pursue her romantically until she turned 18 and graduated from the school I taught at. I didn't groom her, I told her how I felt about her and she felt the same way at the time. Now, over a year later, she is trying to get me fired from my teaching job. She reported me to the school but TLDR the school decided it's not enough to get me fired. I was pissed when she told me this, and then she went on to ask me to quit my job. No. Thats crazy right? She says I ""shouldn't be around young impressionable girls"" but that is absolutely insane because I would never date a student again. Especially not after this.

I a (F18) and my (F18) best friend have been inseparable since we met over a year ago. I was her only friend in two years and I had just moved to a new state.

Recently, my friend and I have been going to the same college for a bit. She started liking a guy and I liked him too. Then, she liked another guy too. There were two people in her eyes now. She was like— you just go for it with him, I still have this thing with the other guy. 

So, me and the guy flirted a lot and we really seemed to be making a connection. We would talk and text all day and it just felt like there was truly something there. My best friend insisted she didn’t like him anymore. Around Halloween time, I hosted a party and invited him to come. He enjoyed some drinks while I was a little bit out of it myself. I texted him “I kinda like you.” And he said “I kinda like you too. We sung some karaoke songs together and flirted back and forth. We talked about how both of us aren’t ready for a relationship right now. I asked him if he liked my best friend because it sometimes seems like it. He said not anymore. My friend needed my help in the bathroom. I went to go help her. She starts talking about him when I bring up the guy. My also drunk best friend told me in the bathroom something that I was not expecting. She likes him still and “whoever gets to him first”. I was so confused. I thought she didn’t like him. I kind of brushed it off , but the next morning it started bugging me. 

The guy and I didn’t talk about that night and he started acting more distant. More and more I would see my best friend flirting with him and it seemed to be reciprocated. I asked him later if he actually liked me and he said he lied and he actually likes my best friend. I was dumbfounded. What was going on?? My best friend started being more distant as well. On a Sunday, I was wanting to hang with her or the guy I liked. She said she had stuff to do at home and he had some family stuff she heard apparently. I thought nothing to it till sometime at work teased her about having a boyfriend. I asked her if they went on a date and she said yes on Sunday. I paused and mentioned “I thought he had family stuff f going on that day” she sighed and confessed that she lied and they went on a date. I ended up crying in the bathroom and came back trying to tell her how the lying just hurt and friendship is built on trust. She got mad and said she knew I would react this way. Then she said she needed time. I tried to somewhat resolve the situation but it was not getting anywhere. I told her I think our friendship needs to be put on pause so we can work through things later when when it was healthier.

Some friends have said that I am in the wrong because she was trying to spare my feelings but the other half of my friends say going behind my back with a guy I liked and lying that they were busy was just plain toxic. They said it felt as if she just didn’t want to take accountability.

I don’t know what to think.
