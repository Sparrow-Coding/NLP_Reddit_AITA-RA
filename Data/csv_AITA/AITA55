I have a thing about taking my shoes off in a house that isn't mine, family or a really close friend. I'm 39 and I remember being like this even back in high school. My family says it's an OCD thing but who knows. 

I clean people's carpets for a living. That's my job. Sometimes we have customers that don't want us to wear our shoes in the house so we put on shoe covers. Today I had a customer ask if I could put some on but I didn't have any. So he asked me to take off my shoes. I told him that wasn't going to happen. He asked ""Why not?"" My answer always is cause I have to clean your carpets and in doing so they will be wet and I don't need to get my socks wet then put my shoes back on with wet socks. 

He then began to question how dirty my shoes were. Asked if I go in public restrooms and such. Honestly the shoes I wear for work are Slip resistant, oil-resistant, steel toed, and even electricity proof. I also only wear them as work shoes. I take them off as soon as I get home. I also explained that as I clean the carpets my shoes get clean during that time. He allowed me to keep them on and do the job but it was still annoying having to deal with it. 

Also the house has just finished getting built and no one has lived in the house yet. He was complaining about having to clean the wood floor after I leave because I was wearing my shoes. You could see foot prints am over the house that weren't mine so I'm not sure what that complaint was about. 

It was also annoying cause we have a certain way we charge for jobs and with out seeing the house and not knowing the Sq footage we can't give an exact price so when I told him how much it was he complained and that cause it was $50 more than what the lady in the office estimated.  He also then added Protectant which was another $80ish.

TL;DR below.

Well call BIL J and gf M

M makes it a point for every holiday to take J to her family's house for the 3 years they've been together save for last Christmas due to covid. When we say we're going to have a fam thing M and J will initially say yes and then M will complain about something (having anxiety, migraine, etc) and cancel at the last minute. Not to say she isn't sick but it's EVERY time it's hard to believe. M also makes it a point to visit her family every Sunday and she and J spend a LOT of time with them and these issues never interfere with that, even if they overlap. J cancels on us as well when M does.

This Thanksgiving, I told them that it would be nice for them to spend the holiday with J fam because they miss them. My FH and I were not going this year (we switch holidays with my fam and his) but everyone else would be happy to see them. They agreed and then M changed her mind again and said shes only going to her fam's. She admitted to me that she did not like J's dad and doesn't want to be around him. I said that wasn't really fair to the rest of J's fam which she agreed about but I didnt push it. 

I suggested to make up for all of us not being there we should do up Hannukah right for his dad this year (dad is Jewish bit kids are all Catholic so he hasn't had a real Hannukah in many years). Again J and M were on board, and today she goes on that she's feeling anxious and that it's a lot for her to commit to even just 1-2 nights. 

My fiancee and I were upset and told Maria and John that it wasn't fair to any of us that we haven't (willingly) spent a holiday with them in years, and when we try to make it up they cancel that too, with M even saying today that it's ""too much time with this family"". 

They got extremely mad at me, J saying he wasn't intentionally excluding his family (I never implied he was) and that I was being obnoxious for butting in
 
This is where I may be TA. As the argument got more heated, I let my own frustrations out and told him that he was acting like he traded in his family for hers, and that if he was going to continue then  just tell us so we can stop wasting our time inviting them to things. 

My fiancee is on my side and said he would have said the exact same thing, and the one friend I discussed this with said my reaction is valid but I might have went a step too far. So AITA?

TL;DR: MY brother in law and his girlfriend make no effort to be part of the family and girlfriend actively says she doesn't like spending time with us.

My (32M) wife (29F) has begged me for a dog for a couple months now. I told her no multiple times. We don’t have time for one, she works 12hr shifts so she’s not home most of the day and on the days she’s off she is working towards her masters. I am busy with my work schedule and I tried to tell her that an animal deserves more attention than we can provide. I offered a cat but she was set on a dog. 

Well the other day she comes to me and tells me her friend had an emergency and has to move out of her apartment and can’t have her dog right now. So she asked me if we can take it for a little bit until her friend figures out what to do with the dog. I agreed so that way she would get what she wanted and what I wanted. I thought it was a good compromise since it was only temporary. 

Now here’s where I’m being accusing of being an asshole. Sometimes I work from home and this day I was in my office working all day, on calls for a lot of it. My wife comes home all upset because the dog was still in its crate and had an accident in it. I told her I never wanted a dog and if she was going to take care of her friend’s she’s responsible for buying it food and taking it to the bathroom and playing with it. She told me I could have took it outside since I was home all day but when was I supposed to do that when I was working?

I cleaned the crate at least for her but she called me an asshole and took her dog with her to her mom’s house saying I neglected her friend’s dog.

About 5-7 years ago, I had a pretty bad alcohol problem. It didn't harm my life that much other than having damaged a few interpersonal relationships, but I decided that I needed to address it. 

I've been going to multiple counselors for about a couple years now and have been significantly better, but a week before Thanksgiving, I had a bad relapse. I was supposed to go to a Thanksgiving dinner with my girlfriend at her parent's house. They're aware that I've struggled with alcohol in the past, yet they still would have served it and would have been drinking during the dinner, which is fine in principle, but it was a situation I personally wanted to avoid. 

I told my girlfriend and she was supportive of us just not going and staying in together. Her dad is pretty upset at me for it though and called me giving me an earful about how disrespectful it was to have cancelled such last minute, especially since he paid for us to fly out. I offered to repay him for the lost airfare, but he wasn't having it.   


I don't have a traditional alcohol problem in that I'm always drinking and am unable to fulfill my obligations; in fact, I've done very well in my career so far. My problem is binge drinking when I do drink. Most of the time, I am able to control it, but this recent incident was just a really bad episode. Such things are very infrequent now, but they don't never happen. 

I feel bad about missing now because I think I probably would have been fine. I was just not mentally in a good place to want to have had to deal with it last week during Thanksgiving. Does this make me an asshole? Is her father right in that I should have gone? My girlfriend herself is very supportive of my decision to skip, which is what's making me very conflicted.

I’ll call them Hannah, Zoe, and Issac. We were all getting to leave to go to college so Hannah had us over her house one last time. For context, my dad had died about a year prior, and they had all been there for me. Anyway, Hannah was trying to get everyone to share things we had been holding back, and they all ended up admitting how much they resented me. They told me how they are tired of me being sad and how I’m different than I used to be. Issac even admitted to purposely ditching me on a school field trip because I cried once two days before that. He also said that even though we were going to the same college, we were getting our own friends and that maybe we could hang out on occasion.

So when a few months later, in college, I have no interest in interacting with him. I made a good group of friends while he didn’t. One day, I saw him looking lonely so I invited him to join my friends for dinner. In the next few days he is everywhere. My roommate sees that I’m uncomfortable and keeps asking me about it so I tell her my past with Issac. The final straw was when I get a text from my new friends asking where I was. Issac had invited all my new friends to dinner without me. It’s not even like he just made a mistake since we were all in a group chat. Nope. He just didn’t include me because he didn’t want to. That’s when my roommate told my new friends how I don’t even like the guy and to stay away from him. I broke and told them how he planned to not even talk to me in college and resented me. Everyone turned their backs on Issac and we stopped inviting him to things.

Issac ended up telling Hannah and Zoe about the whole thing and that’s when I got so many hateful calls and texts. They even attacked one of my family members online for saying something about it. Issac even texted my sister to say hurtful things about me, as if my sister would take his side. My friends and family say I am not in the wrong but I still feel guilty.

Has excuses up the wazoo, but is the nicest guy in person and has historically seemed knowledgeable and good. 

We were getting pretty fed up on the lack of communication, and long story short, amended the contract (and he agreed) that if certain pieces were t done by thanksgiving, he wouldn’t get any more $$ until the job was done. 

We all agreed and we left for 10 days. Problem is- he hired subcontractors who did an atrocious job with the drywall, and they didn’t seal the vents, so there was drywall dust on every surface in our house, then he was then unreachable for 24 hours. We were gone, but our house sitter sent us pics.  He said he would fix if, told us it was paint ready, but we came home to an absolute disaster. 10 feet of garbage in our yard, drywall dust everywhere, half our outlets not working etc.

i worked today and there was a new group of trainers in for the week.


i was in the drive thru section with this new trainer. 

all i was doing was bumping receipts and putting them in the bag. simple.

but no my trainer had to make is difficult.

i was bumping stickers and putting them in there bag as the food comes than it stopped bc the back was making fresh food so i was talking to my friend who was in my section.

my trainer (keep in mind there was nothing to bump bc there was no food since the back was making more) looked at me and told ONLY me “hey, how about you stop talking and start actually doing your job” i answered him back and said “I am there’s nothing for me to do i’m waiting for the food” he told me to sort drinks so i did.

then the second time the back was making fresh food and i was just standing there talking to my friend he again go goes “ hey, how about you do your job and stop talking” and i answered him back again and he told me to lower my tone when HE was giving me attitude and i had a normal tone.

i then got told to take orders outside  which i did. so i went to take orders and then switch with someone after 2 hours and come inside  and i’m now at front instead of drive thru.

it’s now 9:50 and there’s 10 minutes till closing and no one is coming in 

so im again talking with my friend 

the same trainers comes back goes 


“hey, how about you do your job and stop talking” and i replied and said “i am theres no one coming and no orders to take.”

he goes “maybe clean your station take out the trash”

and im talking with 2 more people who he could have asked but he always a asked me

so i go look for wipes to clean my station and told him the wipes were were empty bc they LOOKED it

and he told me “ maybe if you open your eyes more you would see there not empty”

so i clean my station and go make my way to the garbage to throw the wipes away and he was beside the garbage.

so i show him the wipe and lift it up and go “look i cleaned it” and when i lifted it up and bit of the wipe water got on me and him and he got maddd

and he told me i had to go to the back and told couldn’t leave bc of what i did 

so i go to the back 

and he’s like “open your eyes and be more aware of your surroundings” so i told him i didn’t mean it and he told me to lose the attitude when i apologized multiple times!! 

Keep in mind he had attitude the whole time he would talk to me and he was on his phone while “training” us

There is a school dance on soon for the leaving grade. It is technically an optional thing,and I was planning to stay home, but… My teacher, a lovely woman, is leaving the school at the end of the year as well, and wants all of my year to come and is trying to get everyone in her class to go. She’s had one-to-ones with everyone who said they wouldn’t go and is trying to convince them. I said I’d see to buy time.

I have a couple medical conditions that while not physically disabling are very annoying. Often I need the bathroom urgently and repeatedly, and this year it has gotten a lot worse. It is probably linked to a few other health problems which I am only just untangling after about 6 years of not realising how bad it had gotten. 

I’ve been told there are toilets but that isn’t all. I’m not against dancing in general, but I am rather unsure of myself and last time we were told that if someone asked you to dance, you couldn’t say no. There have been a few incidents this year and some things said that I am not sure if it was a joke. Either way, I’m uncomfortable with others touching me if I don’t know them, even if it’s just a dance like the waltz. I have wondered whether there is a way for me to avoid dancing, but as there is a solid 60+ minutes of ‘dance’ on the schedule, I think it would be frowned upon. The dress code is ‘formal casual’ which is apparently like a dress or suit, but here I’ve run into another problem. I own nothing like that.

My wardrobe is pjs, t-shirts, and baggy trousers. I haven’t been able to go to any events like this in years. The ticket to get in is \~$50, and more clothes would be a bit too much. I don’t really see the point in buying something I will wear once and probably hate as I can’t handle some textures, to the point of feeling I can’t breathe. The noise and lights I have no idea about. Sometimes just existing is too much.

And the food. The company making the meals will probably have something for the low sodium diet I need to be on, but I’m not going to lie. I am accustomed to few dishes and I am working on expanding what things I can eat comfortably, but I don’t know whether I could bring my own. I visited a dietician a few years ago but they didn’t see that there was anything they could do in that regard. 

My teacher wants me to go. She's probably one of the most supportive adults in my life. Apart from, it seems, this and a small pattern of her trying to push me ‘out of my comfort zone’ in what I feel is too fast. This isn’t the last interaction I’ll have with her before I leave the school, and the following days would be very awkward if I didn’t go. I might have an awesome time but on the other hand it might turn out awfully. The administrators have phones and I’m sure that people are going to bring theirs regardless of the prohibition stance on them, but maybe if I hate it that much I should just convince someone to call home for me?

There have been a few situations in my life where I (M 21) have been honest with myself and determined that I am a pick me guy to some girls, including one I really liked very recently. It's not something I do purposely, it's just the way my behavior and words come out.

Recently I really liked this girl (F 21) that I had been friends with for a long time, but never got to directly telling her. However, I guess I would always act like a bit of a pick-me and would give off the vibe that I was into her, so eventually she caught on. Many of the classic ""pick me"" things I would do. I made myself too available to her, never tried getting with other girls while talking to her, talked about my own insecurities to her and asked what she thought, etc. Beforehand it always felt like there might be tension between us, but eventually she started acting dry and different. My guy friends shamed me for acting this way and basically made me out to be an asshole for it, and presumably she did too. 

My question is, am I really the asshole for being pick me? Obviously being insecure is not associated with attractiveness, but I wasn't trying to guilt her into anything. I just haven't had much success with women, and was disappointed when I felt she didn't like me back, so it was hard to hold back my insecurities. I wanted to find out what I was doing wrong from the perspective of someone I really liked. And yes I guess I was a ""nice guy"" to her, but does that make me an asshole? Did my ""niceness"" PARTIALLY (I really did care for her as a friend) have to do with liking her? Yes. Isn't that what all flirting is? Trying to build a romantic bond with someone by showing your appreciation with them, why does that make me an asshole? 

Another thing to note is that even when I was certain she didn't like me back, I never pressured her into anything that wasn't platonic. I never lashed out at her for it. Not until she started ignoring me as a friend did I get angry with her. If I made her uncomfortable by liking her, I wish she didn't feel that way, but it's hard to control my emotions. I didn't want to lose her as a friend, so I didn't want to just break off contact. I could see why being pick me could be offputting, but I don't see why I am the asshole.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4845765,public,top,self,"AITA for being a ""pick me"" guy?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zacdnf/aita_for_being_a_pick_me_guy/,all_ads,6,,,,

I had to work with him instead of her for the rest of the day and he  seemed very reserved and shut off and kept saying stuff like “she was my rock, I don’t know how I’m gonna do this without her” and “she was the closest thing I’ve ever had to an older sister” and “I didn’t even get to say goodbye” and finally I just told him that I didn’t get to say goodbye either and he can’t revolve his life around her because he’s got a job to do and he’s his own person, not to mention it’s not like she’s dead so it’s not like he can’t still talk to her.

She's not wrong. 

So I'm about 4 months into my gap year, and she's been absolutely miserable to be around.

Hey all, sorry for the formatting but first time posting here and I’m on mobile. Throwaway account. 

So to begin, I (20f) have been friends with my friend, we’ll call her Jane (20f) for our whole lives. We’re cousins but we always were best friends. 
So Jane has been dating her boyfriend, we’ll call him John (24m) for awhile and they are happy. They have a place together and both work and they even have a dog. I’m happy for her but since she works full time and has other obligations I don’t see her as much as I used to, which I’m also working so I just enjoy the times I do get to hang out with her. 
So about 3 months ago Jane found out she was pregnant, unplanned. She became extremely depressed and anxious. However she started seeing a therapist and was doing better after some time. 
She didn’t tell anyone except her boyfriend, including me, but I found out when she slipped up during a conversation. After I convinced her to admit she was pregnant we talked about it for awhile. I was ecstatic, I was finally going to be an aunt. She didn’t sound too sure whether she was going to keep it or not, but I think she was. She hadn’t told her parents yet and that worried me. I think her mom would be so hurt if she knew Jane had been keeping this a secret from her. 
I kept her secret for awhile but it was starting to weigh on me because it was hard to be the only other person who knew. 
Finally I couldn’t take the pressure anymore and I told my mom because I knew she would tell Jane’s mom. I didn’t want to directly tell her mom because I knew she’d be mad I did. 
Jane texted me and basically told me that I had crossed a boundary and taken an important choice from her, because she was terrified to tell her mom  because it would make it all feel real and she was trying to get the courage to tell her herself. She then told me to never speak to her again. I didn’t think she was serious but it’s been months. 
I found out from her sister that she didn’t end up keeping it but had a miscarriage halfway through that took a major toll on her health. She didn’t even bother texting me to tell me.

When i wanted to cancel the transaction he told me it's impossible then i told me i would give him $500 for all his time, he told me he will sees with his business partners so we went back and forth for a week because there was always an excuses, after a week i felt like i won't get back my money so i took possession of the truck, I powerjumped the truck and i took the truck for an inspection but the truck refused to shutdown at the mechanic so they refused to do the inspection, the mechanic told me it's not a batteries problem but much biggers problem than that.

I called the seller and told him, we just argued so i gave up, i went to see a lawyer because i felt fucked, i don't have my money anymore and i don,t have a truck to work with.

the lawyer told me to sue and he sent a demand letter to the seller which he didnt reply, i calle dthe seller to put some pressure and finally he just gave me a another truck, when i brought the other truck to the mechanic, he told me it's going to cost $10k to repair it

I calle dthe seller, met him and told him that i'm going to sue because i'm fucked anyways, i told him i wanted my money back and he told me he don't have it anymore, we argued so much that he told me he will pays for the truck repairs at his mechanic which going to cost $3k overall, i don't really trust his mechanic, he basically begged me not to sue him, he told me he didn'T want to have any problems.

we are both foreigners and suing someone is a big deal for us

I feel bad for him because i wouldn't be surprised if he already spends or invested the money but i'm way more fucked than him, i don,t have the money anymore nor the truck to work with and i have spend way more to deal with his trucks + the headaches i had.

And it was my fault for taking us both in this situation, i should have inspected the truck but i'm fucked now because i dont have any source of income.

I feel like he doesn’t care about our friendship anymore, and that’s totally fine. But he doesn’t admit that to me, he just tells me he’s busy, but doesn’t share many details or ask for details of my life anymore.

I’m sure cancer changes people and changes priorities. I’m sure sometimes he also doesn’t feel like answering questions about how he’s doing. Maybe he even wishes to isolate, I know I do when I’m depressed.

It just hurts because I’m worried about him everyday and when he doesn’t reply to me it makes me worry even more.

My husband (m28) and I (f26) just celebrated our wedding anniversary yesterday. We got engaged at 20 and 18 I was straight out of high school and we had a very low budget wedding Husbands family wasn’t very happy about it but we pushed on and we’ve been very happy. As part of our wedding anniversary I made a post on social media with some throwback pictures of when we got married, we didn’t have a photographer so the pictures we had were taken on smartphones by guests during the ceremony and reception. My SIL was my husbands best man and came out 5 years ago. She has been very open about her transition but as a result of being husbands best man she is standing in the middle of the photo next to my husband in most of the pictures that involve both of them and in the background or off to the side in others, this is the majority of the pictures we have. I didn’t think much of it because they had already been on social media, I just took them from an album on my social media. After posting SIL reached out to me and asked me to take down all the photos she was in pre transition, including the ones in my album. She said she feels uncomfortable seeing them.  I did take the post down but have not removed the album pictures yet. My husband was a bit upset because 90% of our wedding pictures include SIL pre transition. Even our first dance pictures you can see her in the background. My husband called his SIL and offered to block her from seeing the posts and album but she persisted that she can’t sleep knowing there’s pictures of her pre transition on there and that if we love her then we should just do what she asked without fighting her. I told husband that we can back up the photos so we can still look at them but I was upset that I couldn’t post them because I do like to share them. They’re not perfect but they are our wedding. We did consult some people about editing the images but the image quality is proving to be problematic.

I work for a grocery store and a lot of teenagers and homeless people steal our shopping carts. They cost like 100 dollars each, the store has tasked me with recovering them. 

I go around the creeks and I found 3. Found 2 in a bush near the strip clubs. Yesterday I saw a homeless man with one of our shopping carts. I told him he had to give it back, he starts screaming at me calling me a homeless hating nаzi or something. The dude is probably on drugs. He won't give it to me so I pull it away and dump his stuff out. 

Some bystanders screamed at me calling me a heartless asshole and how I could be more sympathetic. Sorry but it's my job to recover the shopping carts. If we were in america I could legally just shoot him for stealing it and refusing to give it back. So he's lucky. The homeless dude told me I was committing a hate crime by stealing his cart and how he'll die if he loses it and something about his butthole. Most of what he said was incoherent gibberish. I told him that they cost $100 each and he should either buy his own or carry his shit and just because he's homeless doesn't mean he has the right to steal. In reality he is lucky that I am just a store worker. If this was my personal property, I’d have the legal rights to spray his brains on the pavement with my .44.

Ok so let me try my best to explain.

I teach 10th grade, and the oldest student in my class right now is 18. He normally is very disruptive. He likes to put on a bad boy persona, and basically ruin my day every time I come in to work.

He seems to not take his education very seriously, but Im angry for the people who hes brining down who do. He will do things like ask out girls (3 years younger than him) he knows will reject him to make people laugh, he will also make stupid remarks in class after I say certain things.

Anyways one day he came into my class and was falling down and moving in slow motion, and basically embarrassing himself since he was really high on whatever substance he may have chose that day.

I didnt even pay attention to him for the rest of the day since he was so well behaved, he has a 1:45 hour long class with me, and recently he started staying 30 minutes after with me so he can get help with his work (This started 2 weeks ago, but the entire semester he acted like a dbag who wanted to fail).

In his 30 minutes after this class when it was just me and him, he started apologizing saying he actually feels really embarrassed for people to see him like that. To which I told him he shouldnt have took what he took if he didnt want people to see him like that. But I also told him this was the best behaved Ive seen him in any of my classes (I have taught him last year since he was still in 10th grade)

I told him that its his responsibility to act normal like that in class everyday, and I expect him to be a man and do whatever it takes to make that happen for him to pass. I told him I wont tell him how to make that happen, but we already know one way that works.

I didnt outright say drug use, but I implied it.

I told them that we were willing to get our own permits, liability insurance &amp; pay the rental, but they offered to partner with us in the event. We left this meeting agreeing that my team will take care of the organization and promo &amp; they will take care of the city stuff.

Over the six months, it's like pulling teeth trying to get AH or even anyone from their staff to reply to emails, but organization &amp; promo are going fine on our end. We contacted sponsors, local artists/vendors were coming out, there was going to be tacos/vegan/dessert food. Had event schedules, expense reports, rules and waivers, etc.

Fast forward to the last few weeks. We have an email thread going (barely) &amp; the topic of food comes up. Asshat Harold says it's to hard to get food permits, just do pizza. We respond saying we know its tedious, but we still want try. No response.

I contact the city &amp; the guy from the city asks me to send over the info. 

This is where I may be the asshole. I do send the info over.

It turns out no city permit for the event was ever filed. I had essentially just whistleblown on my own event by contacting the city

AH calls me the night before Thanksgiving screaming at me. Literally forty minutes of him raging on &amp; on about how stupid I am, gaslighting me (saying he never agreed to what he DID agree to in the initial meeting), how I'll never accomplish anything this way, threatening to cancel the event, etc. I recorded the entire forty minutes. Truthfully, I can't even listen to it because, admittedly, he did end up making me cry.

I tried explaining to him that I had no malicious intent to go to the city, that I told him nearly five days in advanced that I was going to do it, &amp; that he DID say we could have vendors and food. The event is simply too big to be under the table. Which was our intention. Which was exactly what we stated in our proposal packet. Which is why we came to him SIX MONTHS AGO.

He left me literally no time to get anything approved by the city

I think he never had any intention of turning in permitting for us at all. And I don't know if it's because we're roller skaters and not skate boarders, or if it's because we're women, or if he didnt think we were going to do a good job, or if its cause he didn't think we were going to make him any money or all of it.

Hi, so I 23(nb) and my sister 20(f) had a small disagreement this evening. The rule in our house is generally who ever cooks doesn’t clean and who ever didn’t cook cleans. And usually everything goes in the dishwasher. 

I work full time shift work and my sister is a uni student who has classes twice a week and works 1-3 shifts a week part time. 

She’s home a lot more than I am. And our family usually leaves their dishes in the sink in the morning for who ever is home that day/ who gets home first and we all usually fend for ourselves for supper. My sister and I often eat together/ take turns cooking. Though she’s been doing most of the cooking lately as I get home later. 

She cooked today and she was home all day. The dishwasher was full of the same dishes I loaded into it when I cleaned up last night. 

The disagreement comes from when we went to go to bed and I had to clean up and I asked her to help me unload the dishwasher so I could clean up. She said she didn’t want too and then reminded me that she had cooked all week. 

I got a little annoyed and told her I don’t appreciate her throwing cooking for me in my face like that and that I also didn’t want to clean up but that I was going to do it. 

She got upset but I told her never mind it was fine I’d do it. And I unloaded the dish washer and cleaned up from supper. 

The thing is she leaves much more of a mess when she cooks than I do. I clean as I go I throw out wrappers garbage etc etc. she does not. 

She also mentioned that I’ve been slacking in doing the dishwasher on my days off and how she’s had to do it when she came home from school once or twice ( usually I forgot and I jump up to help once I see her doing it. She’s totally got a point here and me slacking is something that’s on me) so she feels like I’m not pulling my weight and that me asking her to help today was rude. She also mentioned that I’m “ unpleasant” to be around the first 20 mins I’m home from work…. So I told her never mind I’ll just fend for myself from now on and that if I’m so unpleasant to be around after work then don’t be around me. 

So aita for how I handled her side of the argument ? Mostly in regard to her “ unpleasant”comment and for her throwing cooking for us in my face?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4845681,public,top,self,AITA for saying I’ll fend for myself when my sister threw that fact that she’s been cooking more lately in my face?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zabpul/aita_for_saying_ill_fend_for_myself_when_my/,all_ads,6,,,,

I teach 10th grade, and the oldest student in my class right now is 18.  He normally is very disruptive. He likes to put on a bad boy persona, and basically ruin my day every time I come in to work.  

He seems to not take his education very seriously, but Im angry for the people who hes brining down who do. He will do things like ask out girls (3 years younger than him) he knows will reject him to make people laugh, he will also make stupid remarks in class after I say certain things.

Anyways one day he came into my class and was falling down and moving in slow motion, and basically embarrassing himself since he was really high on whatever substance he may have chose that day.

I didnt even pay attention to him for the rest of the day since he was so well behaved,  he has a 1:45 hour long class with me, and recently he started staying 30 minutes after with me so he can get help with his work (This started 2 weeks ago, but the entire semester he acted like a dbag who wanted to fail).

In his 30 minutes after this class when it was just me and him, he started apologizing saying he actually feels really embarrassed for people to see him like that.   To which I told him he shouldnt have took what he took if he didnt want people to see him like that.  But I also told him this was the best behaved Ive seen him in any of my classes (I have taught him last year since he was still in 10th grade)

I told him that its his responsibility to act normal like that in class everyday, and I expect him to be a man and do whatever it takes to make that happen for him to pass. I told him I wont tell him how to make that happen, but we already know one way that works.

I didnt outright say drug use, but I implied it.

I (26F) reached out to a local skatepark in 6 months ago about hosting a roller skate competition in December. There is a skate shop in the park that regulates the park. This shop is basically the middleman between park and city.

I reach out to the owner of the shop &amp; after a month we scheduled a meeting for July.

I love her and always will but lately our relationship has been very rocky. Since I'm in my senior year, I've been working a lot and saving for college. Also, I have a car that i need to pay insurance for and gas money etc. To put it plain, i work a lot of hours. Sam and I usually talk with each other throughout the day. We've had arguments in the past where she's said I haven't responded enough that day, and usually I apologize and work on replying more, and all is well. However, with me working 40+ hours a week as well as school, i haven't had much time for her. It was fine at first, but then she started getting upset at me daily for ""ignoring her"" and not giving her enough attention. I explained that I was trying to save up money for college and couldn't be on my phone at work or school when I was trying to learn, but she still wouldn't hear me. She said I had time when I got off work, or in between breaks. By the time I get off work, I'm exhausted and don't want to talk to people. I just want to get my school done, and then sleep. I also told Sam this, and she said it doesn't take that much energy for someone to have a conversation and that I'm not trying. It takes 2 for a relationship to work, I know this, and I really do try to respond if I can. I understand why Sam is upset, but I feel like she should be more understanding. It's not like I don't respond to her when she does text if I have a spare moment, but it makes me upset that whenever I do text her, the next message I get is her calling me a ""B word"" or other names. I just don't want to message someone knowing I'm gonna get called something the very next text. We haven't spoken in almost a month since our final conversation where she said all this. I want to keep our friendship but I'm scared if I reach out the same argument is gonna happen all over again not even a week later. AITA? 

Extra Info:
 1) Me and Sam don't go to the same school, so we don't get to see each other there

2) Usually I'd reply about an hour or two after Sam messaged me, sometimes later.

I totally acknowledge I was at fault. My car was a total loss, and the person I hit had a lot of scratches and a bump but still drivable (my car was a prius, she had a much larger truck)? She had three young kids with her and was really hesitant to call the police during the accident and asked if I could cover the damage out of pocket. Tbh, I was kind of tempted to bc no one likes dealing with insurance premium increases after an accident, but idk how laws and stuff work so I felt it would've been safer to just call the police and get an accident report. 

After we called the police, and they asked for our license/ registration/ etc, it turns out the woman was driving without a license, which is illegal in my state. She was using her husband's car. He had insurance on the car, so we exchanged info. The police also told me she was getting cited for driving without a license with three young kids in the car. The police left us both with driver exchange forms with each other's contact info and insurance info. 

Obviously everyone was unhappy with the situation and I had to go car shopping which was not fun, given the price of used cars rn. 

Anyways, this happened about two weeks ago. I got a call today from the woman's husband telling me that insurance was refusing to pay out because he had knowingly given his permission for someone unlicensed to drive his vehicle. Additionally, they were heavily fined and charged with a misdemeanor. They are apparently very low income, and this would definitely affect them and their kids. He asked me to help him fight with insurance and for assistance with court costs since I was at fault in the accident and no one would've found out if I hadn't caused the accident.

I actually made a post about the situation I’m in but deleted it so I’ll go into it. I live in student housing, me(25f), A, B, and S. Three girls who all are amicable and in either undergrad in the honors program, masters programs or law school (me) which means our student housing is great, its an apartment close to everything. Seems great right?

We set up a chore board for what we agreed on to do and split up, bathroom, kitchen, living room, cool. Then two weeks in someone added “dishes” to the board. Which had me very confused, but maybe it was just a personal reminder to do it. Then I get a text from B, apparently I had forgotten to wash the dishes. I was literally like ???. I wash them begrudgingly (the dishes were overflowing the sink, none of them mine as I wash mine immediately after use. Ever since, every time I have washed these girls dishes the sink is overflowing with dishes, and I am also expected to pick up the impending dishes which will get dropped off throughout the day into the night. 

I reach out via text to these girls and send “hey, could I possibly get off dish duty considering I wash my own plates?”  But alas, B and A claimed they were far to busy and it doesn’t matter whose dishes are in the kitchen (btw their classes are primarily online and B uses the movie projector daily) I am 2L and I have no time for anything fun but still wash my own dishes. I realized I wouldn’t get through to these girls after repeated excuses why we should all do the dishwashimg. S did not speak up but sent me a thumbs up text.I find this so chaotic and gross, leaving dishes to pile up AND we’ve seen a roach here before. But I had an idea. 

My school/apartment is in a city, theres roaches all over. Especially in the boiler room, which I venture into. First one I see on the floor I squash it and put it in a piece of paper towel wrap it up then in a ziplock bag. While alone at our place I made sure the plates in the sink were mine and unwrapped my small brown friend and put him my plate. I take pictures, then texted them:
“Hey guys. I just found this on my plate when about to wash dishes.
I squashed him with paper towels. This is why I always wash dirty dishes immediately after use, I was worrying something like this could happen. I think it should be best from now on if we wash dishes immediately after use. Sorry for the gross pic.”

Damn, did that shit work. Their responses were them freaking out and agreeing with me. This was only a couple days ago, but it makes me so glad to see everyone washing their own dishes. S came into the kitchen when I was there, looked at the empty sink and just said “beautiful” Glad I could bring her some joy

Tldr: roommates refused to take me off dish duty (we wash everyones dishes in the apartment) despite me washing my own dishes. I killed a roach and set it on a plate in the sink and showed my roommates who now live have been washing their own plates.

I'm friends with Mars (16F), Cass (16F), and Eli (16NB). Cass is dating Manny (18M) and Mars recently got dumped by Moh (16M). This will be important later.

I have known Mars for six years now, since the 6th grade, and we've always been super close. She's sorta been my bodyguard throughout middle school when I didn't have a backbone and she really helped me come out of my shell and start standing up for myself. Mars started dating Moh last year. About a month ago now, Moh broke up with Mars. Around the same time Eli told Mars they didn't wanna be friends with her anymore, so she was pretty devastated. I promised her then and there that no matter what happens I would be there for her, and she wasn't alone. Our friendship only got closer due to this, and we've been hanging out a lot more.

About two weeks ago, I suddenly got a call from Cass. She says hi, then asks me if I had told Mars about her and Manny's personal life. I was very confused and said no and asked why she was asking. Cass then proceeded to explain that Mars had texted Manny asking very inappropriate questions. When Manny told Mars to stop, Mars blew up at him. She started saying that Manny was the reason Moh broke up with her, claiming that Manny makes Moh insecure and nervous. This ended with Manny blocking Mars. I asked Cass and Manny if they wanted me to talk to Mars but they both said no, so I didn't.

Cut to two days ago. I was in class when Eli came in very late and very upset. I asked them what was wrong, and they told me that Mars started accusing them of liking Moh and intentionally breaking them up, even though Moh is straight, Eli isn't a girl, and Eli's aromantic. I asked Eli if they wanted me to talk to Mars and they said yes. Cass and Manny also went back on what they said before and wanted me to talk to Mars, too. Here's where I might be TA.

I texted Mars that same day and told her she needed to stop. I told her that what she's doing is out of line. Mars got defensive, telling me I don't know anything and how everyone is attacking her. I then proceeded to tell her that she's being toxic and mean. I told her that she needs to stop and leave everyone alone. She then got upset, saying that I was going back on my promise to be there for her and not leave her. She said I didn't know anything and that she would leave everyone alone, including me. I'm very sad as she basically just ended our friendship over this. Manny, Cass, and Eli said I did the right thing, but her friends have been saying that I'm an AH who hurt Mars, that I had no business being involved, and how I'm a snake and toxic and are demanding an apology for Mars.

He’s recently also a new hire, but has been working there for about a month or two more. I was told by my boss to not listen to him and what he says to, because he tries to tell me what to do often.

He said it once and told him I’d get to it after I finished these orders, which was only going to take me 5 minutes. But he continued on and said, “well this needs to get done now actually so” he said it with a huge attitude as well, and I repeated myself, telling him I’d do it after I was finished, he continued on about 5-6 more times before I told him to just leave me alone. But to the point, I told him to other day I would go to my lunch at 5:30 and I would only go for 30 minutes so he could take an hour, like he usually does. I also had to leave before him so I had to go to lunch before him. I told him this and he started getting mad saying he’d get in trouble if he went 6-7, but he was literally scheduled to go to lunch at 6, and end at 7. I told him he wouldn’t and he went on and on about how he would get in trouble. So I just walked away to cool down. I came back to help a customer and he started with the shit again “I can’t do that I’ll get in trouble. So you’ll have to go earlier.” So I went off and started cussing him out, and just went to my lunch after that. These aren’t the only instances he acts like this everyday of his life. He’s 31 and this was his first job ever because his parents always did everything for him. They even bought his house, his car, and his phone. And he lives alone.

When i wanted to cancel the transaction he told me it's impossible then i told me i would give him $500 for all his time, he told me he will sees with his business partners so we went back and forth for a week because there was always an excuses, after a week i felt like i won't get back my money so i took possession of the truck, I powerjumped the truck and i took the truck for an inspection but the truck refused to shutdown at the mechanic so they refused to do the inspection, the mechanic told me it's not a batteries problem but much biggers problem than that.

I called the seller and told him, we just argued so i gave up, i went to see a lawyer because i felt fucked, i don't have my money anymore and i don,t have a truck to work with.

the lawyer told me to sue and he sent a demand letter to the seller which he didnt reply, i calle dthe seller to put some pressure and finally he just gave me a another truck, when i brought the other truck to the mechanic, he told me it's going to cost $10k to repair it

I calle dthe seller, met him and told him that i'm going to sue because i'm fucked anyways, i told him i wanted my money back and he told me he don't have it anymore, we argued so much that he told me he will pays for the truck repairs at his mechanic which going to cost $3k overall, i don't really trust his mechanic, he basically begged me not to sue him, he told me he didn'T want to have any problems.

we are both foreigners and suing someone is a big deal for us

I feel bad for him because i wouldn't be surprised if he already spends or invested the money but i'm way more fucked than him, i don,t have the money anymore nor the truck to work with and i have spend way more to deal with his trucks + the headaches i had.

And it was my fault for taking us both in this situation, i should have inspected the truck but i'm fucked now because i dont have any source of income.

I (M31) am upset that my wife (F29) wants to get a cat for our daughter (F6) for Christmas. I say this because we recently spent over $1k for both of our kids presents this year.

I agreed to this as long as we were able to save the rest of my checks this year to catch up. However, she wanted to get a dog for around $500 to keep our puppy company and to learn from him. After about a week, she wanted to surprise me by going to go pick up another gift which turned out to be a cat. She told me how much our daughter would benefit from a cat since she was constantly bugging our son (M4) for attention making him annoyed at times. I told her this is a lot and I don't want to work more to catch up for all of our finances. She tries to assure me that she'll sell her puppy and other things to make it happen. But I am overwhelmed with all the buying and having very little in our savings in case of an emergency on top of having very little credit. I asked if it was a bit much since we got our kids a lot this year, including ourselves. And with another cat would bring more expenses, since I'm currently the only one working and my wife stays at home for the kids. She accused me of not accounting for her feelings, and that I'm being an asshole. She then said she didn't need my feedback and that I don't care about how she's feeling or our daughter, thinking it's all about me. I told her I was feeling the exact opposite that you're not thinking about how much work in overtime I need to do to make this happen since I don't come home till late at night and don't want that and be too exhausted to do anything.

In the beginning, I went through some time (about 3 weeks) adjusting to the different lifestyle. For example, she has a very loud alarm at 5 am that would wake me up in addition to a pretty loud air purifier that is on 24/7. However, I communicated with her as soon as possible and together we found a lower volume alarm with a nice ring tone. Despite this and me putting in earplugs, it still didn't work for me. So I bought earmuffs so I won't have to make her compromise even more. Now I have adapted!

However the issue now is that in the beginning of the year, she was okay with me doing my homework in the room while she sleeps (I turn on a small lamp to the lowest intensity and I have headphones in). Therefore the only noise is me typing on my laptop. However very recently, she sent me a super long text saying she hadn't slept in months because of my loud typing noise and she asks me to do homework outside of the room, thus essentially only using it for sleeping at night. I was very shocked and she also mentions that her earplugs and eye mask don't work against this noise.

I don't really want to move because it is very uncomfortable and inconvenient for me to study in the communal area because of the broken and limited outlets and the loud activities with other students. I also think that I should be able to do my homework in my room too. Furthermore, I even recorded my typing sound and placed my phone next to her bed to get a sense of loudness - but I mostly hear just the purifier. In the end, I suggest if she can try getting earmuffs like me but she still hadn't responded to my texts.

I guess my question is that would I be unreasonable for not wanting to move outside of my room to do work?

I ranted saying you're not thinking about my feelings and think I can just keep working and everything will work out and I'll be okay.

She started in January of this year, things were fine until a few months ago. Out of no where I could sense some tension when I asked her to do things or when I asked her to fix some mistakes she had made. (she makes a lot and instead of just fixing them I want her to do it so she can learn from it)

Because of this I applied to a different position at another branch and I got it, it will be a big promotion and I'm very excited. I am now just waiting to move but I need to be replaced before doing that.

Keep in mind I am a year younger and at our previous jobs she had seniority over me, where as at the bank I had over a full year on her. Things started to get messy and everyone could feel the tension in the air, when I told her I was busy or trying to finish things she would ignore me and when costumers would come in she would ignore them or get up and walk away forcing me to put everything aside to help them. Now I know the customer always comes first and I never minded helping them but it got very frustrating telling everyone I needed 10-15mins to finish things and then still having to stop what I was doing and restarting my tasks

. My manager and other teller have been sick all week and its just been us up front helping people and we haven't really said anything to each other, It doesn't bother me because I'm there to get my work done, get paid and go home but I guess she didn't like it.

Today she told me I did something wrong and her and another coworker had to go and fix it and find some papers and it was ""so so hard"", I told her I remember putting the papers she needed in the binder (where they go) and she flipped out. She went into an office with a loans officer and just starting yelling. I WENT INTO SAID BINDER AND WOW I FREAKING FOUND THE PAPERS SHE NEEDED!! So I knock on the door and show her the papers and she just starts yelling, ""you're not apart of our team, you do nothing all day, I have more transactions in a day then you (I do mostly investments and they aren't tracked the same as regular daily transactions) blah blah blah. everyone at my branch (its small we have like 7 people total) is standing out of their offices watching her yell at me and degrade me so I said ""why do you think I applied for that other job I don't want to work with you anymore I hate it here"" and after that everyone told me to stop and that I was being mean and going too far.

Background: 
My father and I have a strained relationship. He is a narcissist and has been emotionally abusive my whole life. I have struggled setting boundaries with him. He is helping me pay for some of the wedding, but my fiancé and I are paying for the vast majority. Other family is helping some, too. 

Ok, back to the situation:
I am getting married in the spring. My dad and his girlfriend (65F) live together and have been dating for 2.5 years. She has three children — two daughters (35F), who are both gay, and a son (40M), who is homophobic.

Because of Covid hitting right around the time they started dating, I’ve only met his girlfriend’s kids a handful of times. Out of the 3 siblings, I’ve spent the most time with the girls and their spouses, which is maybe only 2-3 times in total. My dad asked me to invite them, and I said yes, although I had originally intended not to invite them. 

Then, my dad asked me to invite his girlfriend’s cousin and her husband, who I have also only met once. They were kind to me and my dad is helping with the wedding, so while I did not originally intend to invite them, I obliged. 

I have only interacted with his girlfriend’s son once for less than 30 minutes. My dad himself “can’t stand him” (his words) and the son and my dad’s girlfriend have a bad relationship. 

When I agreed to invite the two daughters and their spouses, I clarified with my dad  twice and made sure he understood that the son was not invited. My dad said yes, that was okay. 

I chose not to invite the son originally for three reasons:
1. He is homophobic (did not attend his gay sisters’ weddings for that reason) and there will be several gay and trans folks at my wedding. Homophobia is not welcome at my wedding.  
2. My dad does not like him and neither do the spouses of the two daughters 
3. I don’t know him 

So - back to the phone call! 

My dad explained that because the son’s relationship with his mother and my father is already rocky, my dad feels that not inviting the son and his wife (while inviting the other two siblings) would further drive a wedge in their relationship. My dad said to me, “I would not want you or me to feel like your wedding was the reason a son and his mother stopped speaking.”

My dad also clarified that he brought this issue up to his girlfriend, and she agreed — not the other way around. 

Also — my dad asked me not to invite his sister (my aunt). Not sure if that matters in this instance, but it felt similar in reverse so maybe it’s relevant? 

I feel like I am being manipulated, and my dad is overstepping a boundary.

I had a very limited level of French when we met and I have been attending lessons to improve so that I can talk with his parents, siblings and him in French.

They are 14 &amp; 10 and I have sole custody with no child support. We had it this way because I was successful in my career and my ex was struggling with drugs and keeping a job when we divorced so I declined support. He has no legal visitation.

For 5 years he lived in another state. He saw the kids maybe twice. After his latest break up my husband and I agreed to help my ex get on his feet up here so he could be near the kids. He stayed with us until he got a job and place.

My ex got a girlfriend pretty fast. My oldest at this point recognized the pattern whenever he gets a girlfriend he only wants to be with her. My 10 year old still wanted to be with his dad when he could. I never bad mouth him in front of the kids. If there was something wrong the kids will know when they older without me telling them, kind of how my teen is starting to in his own.

I asked my ex to please tell me ahead of time when he wants our son. He NEVER listens to me about this. He will ignore any texts I send but if he texts asking to pick him up and I don’t jump and answer he starts throwing a fit.

I usually just cave and let him take him because I don’t want to be the kind of person to keep them apart. Today I was cleaning and didn’t look at my phone. I glance at my phone and have a bunch of texts from my ex. At first asking if he can get (son) then getting mad that neither of us are replying. He started accusing me of ignoring him to which I replied “I was cleaning and (son) was doing his homework”. He asks again so I said no and “I have repeatedly asked that you please give me advance notice so this texting frantically doesn’t happen and I can have him ready. I know you get your schedule a month in advance so please just plan it with me” he responded “I don’t need to plan with you I just want to see my kid”.

My ex does nothing and outright refuses to even buy things like school supplies. He says he’s willing to take my 10 yr overnight on school nights but having been married to him for 9yr and having to run out of my job to get a child he slept thru pick up many times I don’t trust him to be responsible for his homework and getting him to school. 
He says he doesn’t always know his plans ahead of time. I told him you mean you don’t know what your girlfriend or friends have planned? Because he does know his work plans. I told him it’s his problem that he prioritizes his social life. He needs us to work around him.

He pushed and pushed until I asked him “do you know any of your kids teachers names? Their doctors name? What grades they had last period” he waited a bit then responded that I was disgusting for keeping him away from his son.

My middle sister has recently - in the last year or so - become very insistent on how we pronounce her name. Imagine it is “Clara” and the family oscillates between saying “Claira” and “Clara” and has since we were children. It’s thoughtless, slip of the tongue, etc. as we’ve been saying it with different emphasis for years on/off.

Of late, if me or my eldest sister (I’ve been the worst offender of this) forget and thoughtlessly say “Claira” instead of “Clara” she gets super insistent, stops the conversation and announces it is not her name. I understand that it can be frustrating, but I also am starting to get annoyed because I’ve been saying “Claira/Clara” since I could speak. It is always said with love and affection, never with malice. Never to intentionally disrespect.

Today, my eldest sister slipped and we all got into a huge argument. My middle sister said that this started when she attended a class on professional empowerment for black women and they made a point that resonated with her — never let anyone disrespect you by mispronouncing your name. She said she was wounded that with her own family she’s been so disrespected. I said that I felt she was misplacing wisdom given to her to protect her in a professional setting and using with family that had no ill intent. Eldest sister agreed and I said that we were trying our best but after 30 years it takes getting used to. Middle sister insisted we weren’t trying and didn’t take it seriously because we had laughed about it earlier (we had — it was sudden, I personally thought it was silly I admit but the more it comes up in conversation, I have taken it seriously so we can stop arguing about it). We talk over each other. Hang up before it escalates. At this point, it’s a ridiculous thing to argue over. 

I love my sisters. I love “Clara/Claira.” If I think before I say her name, I remember how she wants it pronounced but if Im just talking, I say it how I’ve been saying it for years. I don’t want her to feel disrespected and it feels so silly to argue over this as grown adults.

My girlfriend Paige and I became parents at 17. Our daughter Lola is now 6. When we told my parents we were pregnant, they were through the roof pissed off, and, in hindsight, I don't blame them.

What frustrates Paige and I is, they've never left that position and they almost seem to hunt for things to critique about our parenting.

When we told Paige's parents she was pregnant, their opinion was, more or less, "" You guys are idiots"", same with mine. Only difference is Paige's parents have actually relaxed. They love being grandparents, bringing random gifts over, the works. My parents stop by and it's, "" You became parents too young, you should've waited. Do you know what you're doing?""

When my mom called, asking if she and my dad should come over Christmas Eve or Day to spend the day, I told them that, Paige and I'd talked and we both felt that what was best was if they could come over, bring the gifts, stay for 30-40 minutes, then leave.

My mom was hurt that I'd given them such a tight window, as was my dad. My point to them was, whereas Paige's parents initially were worried about us being parents, they've left that in the past and now focus on giving Lola bundles of love and attention, while, everytime she and my dad come over, we just relitigate the same argument from when I was 17. My mom asked when I would drop my, what she views as animosity. I said that was up to her and dad and added that I have no issue, if need be, telling Lola that the reason she doesn't see my parents is because they hate that Mom &amp; Dad love each other.

In my mind, I'm thinking argument, but what she meant was physical. I immediately go to my dad's room for him to already be on the phone with Patty. Patty is telling her side. We believe her because Z was very dismissive about what happened as if it meant nothing. My dad gets onto Patty about how this is her fault her oldest is like this. I get onto Z about how she shouldn't be putting her hands on her mom, I asked her why she did it.

 Her answer was because her mom took her makeup, I then started to yell at her. I asked her, ""Is it okay if I put my hands on you then? When you come over tomorrow, should I just beat your ass in the front yard?"" Z knows that I used to fight in highschool, after having my daughter at 16, I completely stopped fighting because it was no longer something I wanted to reflect on my character. I haven't fought since, but I could hear Z starting crying, saying how she was sorry. I told her I didn't want to hear it. (SHE KNOWS I WOULD NEVER LAY HANDS ON HER, I TOLD HER)

 I am still beyond pissed, I told Z that she will be staying here 1 month, but she will have rules, boundaries and she better not even think of ever raising her voice at me, cursing at me or laying her hands on me. I told her I wasn't her mom, I would pack her shit and send her back to her mom's place if she ever got disrespectful to me. Z is still crying, I tell her I will pick her up tomorrow after school, and we are going to have a long talk. I kept telling Z she needs to understand she is 11 years old, not an adult, and she will do what i say when i say it, period. Z has never seen me in ""mom/adult mode"" just due to the fact I never really had to get into it. My daughter behaves, even when she does get out of line very few times I tell my daughter once and she just does it. The month Z stays here, I am going to be strict and structured with her. She needs to learn that she will not do whatever she wants in my house. She will understand that the world will not work in her favor, and she needs to put her emotions in check.

First, I am still helping out on the group project. Sharing ideas and doing my fair share of the work. But my partner refuses to accept the way I’m doing it. And when the teacher joins in to talk to us, says that my work is his.

At this point I’m done. They are set in their ways and I keep trying to explain that it isn't what the teacher wants (I want to share details but I know I’ll be called out by my partner if I do). So… the teacher calls for A, I suggest B ( open for help) and my partner wants A+B+C+D to all compile at once (Programming). We just need to get one variable which is unneeded.

I’ve done all of the outline, all of the work, and he keeps just rewording my work so it's his, when mine worked perfectly fine. I’m not saying mine is the best, but for the level we are at, and from what we know. It's BS in my mind, he just reached the same results that I did two weeks ago and called it a breakthrough.

All in all, Still gonna help with the ‘group’ but at this point I'm gonna ask him to submit the final project and upload mine on the side, as the teacher only asks for one of us to submit it.

It usually runs from 9am to 12pm (they run it three days a week but I stopped going on the Wednesday.) 
Usually pack up is meant to start at 11:30am, it use to be 'start packing up at 11:15am' but no one did so I also stopped doing it too as it would only be me doing it (inside and outside areas are big spaces.)

If for nothing else to just let the person know you love them, are happy they are here on this earth, and make you feel special one day out of the 365. In 2019 I was still grieving the loss of my 11 year old dog (I had prior to marriage) who had passed a few months before. For the first time I genuinely had zero desire to celebrate anything and my small family (my parents and my husband) totally understood and respected that. I told them “if you would really like to celebrate we can do it up next year” when I turned 40 as it’s a big birthday. 

Fast forward to 2022. My birthday falls on a Thursday and with it being mid week, no one has the time or energy to get together after work. Totally fine, we make plans to have dinner with my parents on the weekend. We have a 1 year old puppy now, both have decent jobs, and life seems relatively stable. My birthday rolls around and I get a “happy birthday” from him in the morning, and I continue on to work, happy he remembered. I had a super long day and had to work late, but when I came home (and he got off work) I discovered he did nothing and had planned nothing for my birthday. He hadn’t even bothered to get a card.

We don’t have kids and I only have my parents for family. I wasn’t expecting much, he didn’t have to be extravagant or expensive, just something that showed I was loved and he cared. He could have cleaned or cooked dinner and I would have just been happy he put in the thought and effort, but there was zilch. 

He seems to feel genuinely bad about it but the day is kinda ruined. I got texts from friends but the one person who I am the closest with couldn’t have been bothered to do anything at all. Not to be overly dramatic but at this point I am hurt and just want to swear off birthdays all together.

We are sometimes annoyed by the task, but we understand how important it is for our kids to have family experiences with my family. I am a little late to the parenting party, as my sister's kids are all grown (22, 21, 19). In the years past we've always gone to my mom's house for the holidays. Now that one of our kids is old enough to be excited for xmas and have core memories, we'd like to stay home, begin new traditions, and invite extended family to join us here at our home.  


When we brought this up to my mom and my sister this evening we were met with a huge resistance, particularly from my sister, stating that she always had to drag her kids to my mom's house for xmas (which is not entirely true when her kids were young). My sister states that her daughter (19) is allergic to our pets (we have 3 dogs - one is hypo-allergenic. My mom has 2 cats, so her argument is garbage, imo. Oh, and my sister also has a dog that they have to put away when my niece comes to visit from college). When my wife mentioned wanting to need some evening time with the girls for xmas eve traditions and preparing for Santa, my sister told her we could do this after dinner at 8-9pm (keep in mind it's at least a 45 min drive home), when generally our kids are in bed by 8pm. My wife and I need time to ""prep for Santa's arrival ourselves. We will also need to prepare for my wife's family on xmas day, who graciously agreed to come to our house, to help accommodate for our girls.   


IMO, my sister is trying to take control of xmas plans and have everyone come to her house so she doesn't have to travel and be inconvenienced, yet she has no kids to look after. 

We argued that we had the young kids and that it's very arduous for us to have to pack everyone up and drive for 45 mins (city traffic) only to turn around and drive back and hopefully ensure that we have time to make arrangements for Santa's arrival. As well as get them both to bed at a decent hour so they're not monsters the next day as  we'd like to enjoy Xmas day with my wife's family. (BTW we have extended the invite to my family to come visit with my wife's family if Xmas eve is not convenient for them.)

Wish I was here for a different situation, but I'm not. The ongoing issue with my niece has essentially become even worse, I believe. 

I got a text from my niece that she wanted to be picked up right now. I asked why she said it was an emergency. I asked her for more details, and she just said her mom &amp; her fought. In my mind, I'm thinking argument, but what she meant was physical. I immediately go to my dad's room for him to already be on the phone with Patty. Patty is telling her side. We believe her because Z was very dismissive about what happened as if it meant nothing. My dad gets onto Patty about how this is her fault her oldest is like this. I get onto Z about how she shouldn't be putting her hands on her mom, I asked her why she did it.
 Her answer was because her mom took her makeup, I then started to yell at her. I asked her, ""Is it okay if I put my hands on you then? When you come over tomorrow, should I just beat your ass in the front yard?"" Z knows that I used to fight in highschool, after having my daughter at 16, I completely stopped fighting because it was no longer something I wanted to reflect on my character. I haven't fought since, but I could hear Z starting crying, saying how she was sorry. I told her I didn't want to hear it. I am still beyond pissed, I told Z that she will be staying here 1 month, but she will have rules, boundaries and she better not even think of ever raising her voice at me, cursing at me or laying her hands on me. I told her I wasn't her mom, I would pack her shit and send her back to her mom's place if she ever got disrespectful to me. Z is still crying, I tell her I will pick her up tomorrow after school, and we are going to have a long talk. I kept telling Z she needs to understand she is 11 years old, not an adult, and she will do what i say when i say it, period. Z has never seen me in ""mom/adult mode"" just due to the fact I never really had to get into it. My daughter behaves, even when she does get out of line very few times I tell my daughter once and she just does it. The month Z stays here, I am going to be strict and structured with her. She needs to learn that she will not do whatever she wants in my house.

I got divorced in 2021 and really haven’t felt romantic with few girls i have been on dates with after that.

1 month ago I met this amazing girl in bar trivia (she was visiting town) and instantly clicked. we both felt very comfortable with each other and eyes sparkling kind of attraction. I have not felt that way in a long long time, not even with my ex wife. She also asked me to come visit her in her city and see how things go.

She called me next day to hang out with her colleagues which i was happy to go but she left mid way and said good bye. I was bummed cause she didn’t gave me out and I felt abandoned (I have abandonment issue and its a trigger)

I went home after hanging out a bit but felt awkward as they were like who is this guy who she called and left mid way (might me me thinking this more)

Next day I texted her saying I felt bad and not sure if I wanna visit her, I really missed this kind of connection and chemistry we had so I text few days back and said i would visit her but still kinda bummed at that day but we can ignore for once and move on.


I told her next Tuesday that I’m visiting her city on Thursday and would like to spend all the time with her. She was excited and god knows me too.. I was so happy (been depressed and lonely for a while)

She said she is not available on Thursday, which I said okay we can grab coffee on Friday for which she never responded. She called on Friday evening saying she is a bad texter and lets grab dinner on Saturday which I agreed.


She text on Saturday afternoon saying she is excited for which i also responded that I’m super super excited. In the evening right before (15 mins) the date she said she will not be able to meet up as she is still not home from golf and i felt abandoned again. This time I texted her that this is so unacceptable and said I’m done with whatever this is. She said sorry and asked for one more chance but i was so upset that i told her she is selfish and doesn’t care for anyone’s tome or feelings and I blocked her (I was drinking and disappointed)

Next day she posted a story saying she doesn’t owe anyone any apology.
She did tell me anytime things so bad you just say you wanna stop pursuing this.

I miss her and thinking of reaching out to her

She goes to college full-time, and I work full-time. I pay almost all the bills, but she does pay for her half of the rent (or at least her parents do). I really like our apartment. We’re relatively close to family, friends, nice restaurants, cool music venues, and so on. 

My girlfriend is graduating college this May in a field she’s worried she won’t find a job locally for. She said she may need to apply outside of the area, being willing to move up to 2-4 hours away for it. 

Early in our relationship I set the boundary that I will not be in a long-distance relationship. I don’t like distance, and I don’t like the uncertainty and distrust that it has the potential to add to a relationship. To be succinct: my anxiety could never. 

I also set the boundary that while I am willing to move anywhere for her, I want for us to know for certain that she’s not getting a job locally before we uproot our lives and move, and so she should only apply for jobs within an hour radius for a while so that we don’t have to move if we don’t need to. I brought up the idea that first 6ish months after she’s out of college, she works full-time at her current job so we can save money and prep for a possible move if she can’t find a local job in her field. Then once those 6ish months are over, she can widen the search and we’ll move if necessary.

Asking someone to pack up and move is such a big request. I would have to quit my job, leave my family and friends behind, and start fresh somewhere else. Yet, my girlfriend thinks I should be okay with moving in those first six months if we have to. She thinks I’m being unreasonable for not being willing to either do long-distance or move with her. I think she’s being unreasonable for not waiting a little while after graduating before we make such a bold life change.

We became close through our job we both had in college, and we went through a lot together. She had some trauma that I helped her through (staying at her apartment every night, helping her move, driving her 20+ hours across the country multiple times, etc.), which caused us to bond very quickly.

After she moved across the country, our friendship began to fade quickly. We had 21 hours of distance between us, but we would make trips to see each other about 4 times a year, and would FaceTime whenever we could.

After she had been gone for about 2 years, my longtime boyfriend decided to propose. She ruined it, telling me when the proposal would be happening, and I was crushed. My boyfriend had to completely change the plans last minute and kindly asked her not to fly in for the engagement party.

I could feel my opinion about her changing into something negative, and I did my best to distance myself. However, I still made her a bridesmaid. BIG bad on my part. Many things followed this, such as being mad she wasn’t my maid of honor, being vocally jealous of friends who lived near me, trying to invite random people to my wedding so her boyfriend wouldn’t have a “terrible time”, and being upset with how much my bachelorette trip was going to cost (about $300 for a weekend in Austin). 

She eventually got engaged, and I ended up spending $1200 on her bachelorette trip. She made me her matron of honor after originally asking me to be a bridesmaid. Although she did not admit it, I knew it was because her sister (the maid of honor) did not want to fulfill any of her duties. She didn’t contribute help or ideas, finances, or support in general, so those things fell on me. She didn’t come to the bachelorette, because she got sick. But the bride understood!

A few months after her bachelorette, my life got crazy. I went on my honeymoon, started my brand new full-time teaching job the day after we got home, moved houses, and was preparing for a 2-day drive to the bride’s wedding. 1 week before her wedding (on the first week of school), I started to feel sick. I had a fever, headache, cough, achy body. My husband joked that it would be crazy if I was sick the week of her wedding. So I took 2 at-home tests. They were positive. I was in shock, so I went to get a lab test to be certain. They called me back 15 minutes later on the DOT to tell me I needed to stay at home. I let the bride know immediately, and her response was: “That’s not a real test”. Then proceeded to tell me to make the 2-day drive (while sick and my husband was starting to show symptoms) and expose all of her friends and family. I discussed it with my husband, and we decided it was not smart or responsible.

I texted her a long and profuse apology to which she never replied, and on the day of her wedding I texted her congratulating them both, to which she also never replied.
