Today my mom (56f) went to a tarot reader, she sometimes has her cards read but this was the first time with this tarot reader, who was recommanded to her by a friend. Well, my mom asked some questions first about herself, some relationship advice mostly, then she proceeded to ask about the situation (health, work, relationship) of her loved ones, like me and my brother. 

Firstly, I’d like to say that my mom’s reading seemed pretty accurate to her.
Basically, I’m bi with a strong preference for women and I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend (23f) for about 6 months. 
Everything is going amazing, our relationship is very healthy and she loves me very much, just as I love her. The problem is the tarot reader told my mom my relationship is going to end at some point because I’ll lose some weight (I just started a diet but I’m not overweight, I’m trying to lose 10kg) and become very beautiful (I’m pretty average looking, nothing bad but nothing special in my opinion, my mom is a beautiful woman though) and my girlfriend won’t accept how beautiful I will look and that’s going to end our relationship. I’d like to point out that my gf is one of the most supportive people about my diet. 
Also, she said my gf is leaning on me a lot because her situation at home isn’t perfect (her mom is a bit controlling and she doesn’t know her daughter is in a relationship with a girl)
Plus, the tarot reader also said I’m going to have a boyfriend in two years. 

Now, I don’t know how to feel about all of this, obviously the last thing I want to do is leave my relationship or have this situation ruin what is a prefectly healthy relationship. On the other hand I don’t know if keeping all of this from her is the best idea. 
So WIBTA if I told all of this to my gf even if none of it might turn out to be true? 
I was hoping to get some advice.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4812105,public,top,self,WIBTA if I told my gf my mom went to a tarot reader who told her my relationship is going to end?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0zeya/wibta_if_i_told_my_gf_my_mom_went_to_a_tarot/,all_ads,6,,,,

I didn't know anyone there when I moved. Soon after, I met this girl we'll call C, and we quickly became best friends, so much so that it was common that we'd hang out multiple times a week and text all the time.

After 5 months, C started to show interest in sleeping with me. I was against it, since didn't want it to affect our friendship. C convinced me that if we started sleeping together, we would still be able to remain best friends, as this was her priority as well as mine. I still said no.

I was seeing another girl we'll call L. L and I weren't serious, but after I kissed L in front of C, C asked me not to kiss L in front of her. I agreed and stopped to protect her feelings.

As C and I got closer physically (I slept in her bed after she was crying to comfort her), we eventually had sex. Once we had sex, we decided to be exclusive, which meant I stopped seeing L. She wasn't seeing anyone at the time.

After 2 weeks, she met a guy we'll call T. Once she met T, she decided that we should be fwb and not be exclusive anymore (which was what we intended to do eventually). I wasn't comfortable with her seeing T and asked her to postpone her date, which I felt was fair since she asked me to stop seeing L, but she went out with him anyways.

Her and I had discussed rules regarding using condoms and no oral sex with others while we were fwb. When she had sex with T for the first time she broke both of these rules and told me after.

I was heartbroken, and as part of comforting me, she suggested we go back to being exclusive for 2 weeks to allow me more time to feel ok with this. I agreed.

2 days later, she told me she wouldn't follow this agreement as she thought I was controlling her. I told her she didn't have to follow the agreement, but I would be devastated if she broke it, as it would be breaking another promise to me. She had sex with T soon after, within those 2 weeks.

She then asked for space from me, and I didn't speak to her for 2 weeks while I was away visiting home.

When I arrived back, I asked for a lift from the airport which she had previously promised me, but she made up some excuses, and afterwards told me she didn't feel comfortable being alone with me anymore now that she was with T.

The next time I saw her at a party we chatted and acted like best friends again. She mentioned how she missed me.

After this, I reached out and asked her what she was doing next weekend, and she blew me off. I asked her something was wrong, and she said she didn't think she'd ever be comfortable with us being friends.

I feel hurt as this was what I was scared of in the beginning and now it's happened. We've had no contact for about a month now. This includes social activities we did together, but she hasn't come to anything since we last spoke. I'm concerned I might've made her too uncomfortable to attend.

(30 hrs away, I’ve driven it myself before) he called me and I told him we would figure everything out with our son when I got to my moms and he threatened to call my car in stolen (it’s in his name). His mother tried to get him to file for emergency custody and told him that if I got to my moms they would never see our son again. Said she was just protecting her son (he’s almost 30, a grown man) Well I ended up stopping 1/4 of the way there and we worked things out, he met me where I was, but I still went to my moms to take a break. The whole time I was there his grandmother and mother tried to get him to file for custody. His grandmother told him he should’ve given me a week to get back because I kidnapped his son. His mother told him that I would never get the help I need. She asked who was going to take care of our son since I “clearly couldnt” (I was a sahm for 2 years). Fast forward to me coming back, his grandmother has demanded that he bring our son to see her but I’m not welcome in her house unless I apologize. His mother hasn’t respected me as a mother the whole time we’ve been together. So after hearing that she said I couldn’t take care of our son I told my husband that she could come to our house if she wanted to see our son. (She smokes in her house, talks shit in front of my son if I’m not there, and she’s extremely narcissistic) I don’t think a 10 minute drive is too much to ask of her. She told me that if my husband wanted to bring our son to see her I needed to stay out of his way.And that I was not allowing anyone to see him. (My husband has taken him to birthday parties involving them, they have seen him since I’ve been back). We’ll now it’s almost thanksgiving and my husband told me he was going over there whether I was going or not.

So, basically I quit my job (absolutely loved it, but pay vs cost of living) and decided to give myself a breather and visit my extended family. I've been working on getting a visa there, but have been looking into job opportunities here and back home. 

Before I left, I explained to my brother what my goal was and explained that if everything goes accordingly, I'd be staying indefinitely otherwise I'd return in 3 months. But, that it was really out of my control (waiting on documents). I also asked him if I could use two suitcases for this trip to which he was cool with, no problem. While I was there, he asked again and I told him 100% I'd stay if it works out.

Fast forward two months he's asking me to pay him $250 for the suitcases if I'm going to be staying there for longer. He says I should pay him b/c I technically I asked to ""borrow"" them and technically said I'd be back in 3 months if things didn't work out - I am still waiting on documents, he knows this!

My brother has a wife and kids, but is financially well off. I'm currently living off of my savings (enough to keep me comfy) and can't work here yet b/c of legal reasons. 

My mom and friends say I was right not to pay him, but I guess I get where he's coming from. He has a family of his own now but I guess, I personally wouldn't have asked for money if the roles were reversed. That combined with other factors just makes me feel kinda sucky!!

My parents are divorced, so for the holidays growing up I always spent the morning at one parents house and the afternoon at another’s, and both parents drug me to whatever family they wanted me to see during their time with me. It’s a full day affair and tends to leave me exhausted, especially as an adult because I moved almost 2 hours away, so I have to account for a 4 hour round trip min. My wife’s family is very small and doesn’t do much for the holidays.  
This is the last year before my wife and I start planning to expand our family, and whatever our plans for the holidays are I want to spend then with her. We’ve never gotten a full Christmas alone together (minus one year our town flooded and we were stuck at home waiting evacuation notices), normally she goes to her Grandmother’s house and I go visit my parents and then we have dinner together. This year I want to spend the whole day with her, maybe invite her grandmother or my dad for dinner. My mother is not a fan of this plan. She wants me to ditch my dads family and my wife’s family, spend the entire day with her, and leave my wife out of it because “all she wants for Christmas this year is for me to come home.” My stepsister moved further away than I did and isn’t coming home so I think my mom is desperate to at least have one of us around so it.
My mom does not approve of my wife, has requested continuously that I do not bring her up in conversation, and pretends she doesn’t exist. It hurts, but my mother is extremely conservative Christian and was raised by super strict Christian parents that she has a long, complicated and traumatic relationship with. I have a feeling that when her parents die, I might be able to get through to her. Or when my wife and I have kids, because my mom and her husband want grandkids very badly. We were very close at one point, and then she formed this fictional opinion of my wife in her head that she’s so wrapped up in she can’t see the wonderful person my wife really is.
I want to refuse her offer of going home for the holidays, but I also don’t want to damage the relationship I have with her further. I love my mom, even if shes an asshole, and I believe she can change for the better. Her and I were really close at one point, she was the only person whom encouraged me to be my weird self. At one point, she was the “nice parent” And my dad was the asshole. She doesn’t seem to get that I want to start my own family and I can’t revolve my plans around my parents anymore.
Would I be the asshole for setting this boundary and staying home with my wife this year?

They replace them every so often. My siblings have beautiful professional portraits up, my brother with his family and my sister and brother in law at their wedding, but my new picture is a crappy picture my parents took from my Instagram and had printed. First of all, it’s an objectively bad picture because my coworker took it on his phone and the lighting is bad, I’m not looking at the camera, plus it’s a picture of me at work in my ugly work clothes, and I was having a bad hair day. Also, I don’t even care about my job that much so it doesn’t make sense to make that my photo.

This is especially upsetting because I’ve often seen myself as the ugly duckling of the group, and I’ve seen myself as less successful than they are. I’ve been trying to move past this and focus on what I’ve accomplished without comparing myself to them, but I feel like these pictures are a visual representation of what I’ve been struggling with. 

I asked my parents why they picked that picture and they said that since I’ve been feeling down lately they wanted to show me how proud I should be of my work accomplishments. They picked that photo because it shows me and a bunch of other people receiving an award (the others are cropped out). I had already explained to my parents that I did not really do much for this award. The only thing I did was sub in for someone who was out due to surgery, and I literally just followed the directions that were left for me for two weeks until the regular person came back. I appreciate being included, but I didn’t do very much so I don’t consider it a big accomplishment. My parents are very upset that I don’t value getting the award and insist that I always downplay my role at work, but the truth is my job just isn’t that complex or interesting.

I have some hobbies that I’m pretty good at and work really hard. One of them is my amateur dance company, we are pretty good and put on good performances. At a recent performance, a photographer took a really good picture of me on stage. It’s a wonderful photo, and I look cool, and I’m wearing a really great costume. I suggested that my parents put that picture up instead, because it’s actually a good picture of me and represents something I worked hard on and am proud of. They refused to do that and said I needed to take pride in my career. I asked if they would put back the old picture, which was from a photography session a few years ago and looks nice, but they wouldn’t do that either. So I said to them that anyone who saw these pictures is going to assume that I’m less liked than my siblings because my picture is so crappy and my mom teared up, and they’re both upset at me.

I have a strained relationship with my mother and drugs, I share my pills out of consideration but limit it a lot. Recently it’s been just our own. But I know she takes sleeping tablets and has driven on even as strong a tablet as ambien, so I got concerned when she came out from getting tablets hiding her hand. She was insisting it was rubbish, I wondered why she’d hide it but got more bothered by my brother being passive aggressive. He was either making comments or not looking at me if I spoke to him. I said something and he told me to shut up, I felt faint (I have illnesses and they are aware of this) so I sat down, then I think they took it to be childish when I just wanted to talk. He walked out. My mum and I spoke in the hallway, I vented that I’m tired of people talking behind my back about me when if they told me I could change it or try to. He heard but thought I was talking about the pills which I didn’t care about. She told him that, then something was said as he was poking right at me, he was aggressive and extremely close to me. I was annoyed with the pointing and stupidly made an example by pointing at him, then my nail touched his face and his hand went for my throat. He instantly grabbed me, I only got him off with the help of my mum and like pushing into his wrist. Afterwards I was shocked, yelling if he really tried to choke me and he was acting like I was being dramatic. I was shaky and panicking and I tend to be resistant to help. My boyfriend is good at just calming me down, my mum crowded me then made a comment that we were both angry so it was the same both ways. I was stupid and did apologise for ‘showing’ her how it was, I lightly touched her neck (not the grip he had), and she was kinda squatting next to me so she fell back. Later said I threw her. 

My brother has said he meant to grab my shirt. He is sorry, initially he was heading to the cops to hand himself in. I told him if he ever did it again I would call them, but also stated to the family that it was abuse, traumatic. My mother went on about it not being an assault because I provoked him and I smoke weed anyway. She also insulted me multiple times and was flippant during what was meant to be some kind of apology.

Now for the most part I ignore it, he's a ok guy the rest of the time and I mostly want to avoid conflict with neighbours. (Though it is probably worth noting that we've never established any other lines of communication, such as exchanging phone numbers.)

However on occasion I've had to knock on to ask him to turn it down, whether that be because of the volume and time of night, because my partner (who has alternating shift patterns) is struggling to sleep, etc. 

And in the past this has been fine, he's answered the door and apologised and turned it down. It is annoying that it still happens after having spoken to him about it but that's by the by. 

However, this past week I've been quite ill and am struggling to get rest. The music was coming through even louder than usual to the point that I had no chance of getting to sleep, this was around 10 at night and the music had started about an hour and a half earlier. So I got dressed and went to speak to him. After ringing the doorbell and knocking several times to no response I came back inside. 

At this point I was feeling very frustrated so I ended up hammering my fist on the connecting wall about seven or eight times in succession, and shouting at/through the wall for him to ""shut up"". This did actually result in him turning the music down. 

However, since then in speaking to other people it's been pretty unanimous the belief that the way I reacted was very aggressive. And I wouldn't disagree necessarily - I definitely recognise I reacted in the moment, but I felt justified in doing so.

Both of us are renting 1 room in a 2 bedroom house and pay equal rent. The problem is, it often feels like she forgets that she doesn't own the place and that it is my space, too. 

Ashley is going home to her family for Thanksgiving, and I asked her if I could host a few people at the house for my Thanksgiving. She was fine with that. It's just 3 other people I'm bringing over, my chosen family, and Ashley will be gone anyways. 

Today I woke up and the house is completely decorated for Christmas. I mean full natural cut tree in the living room, plus mini Christmas trees on the tables, 3' nutcracker sentries in the hall, Christmas villages set out, stockings hanging from the fireplace, Christmas pillows on the couch, the full 9 yards. (Ashley goes to bed way later than I do, and I had heard her being loud at night but didn't feel like getting out of bed to investigate).

And I just feel so sad. I don't mean to sound like a grinch, but it is too early for all of that. And Ashley's leaving in a couple days anyways, so it feels like she could have waited. The main reason it makes me so sad is that I'm hosting my Thanksgiving here and it's already decked out for the season of commercialism.  If this had all gone up after Christmas, I'd be fine with it. And if she'd asked me, we could have compromised. But instead she redecorated the whole house without me.

I'm going to talk to her when I get home from work today. I'm not even sure what a fair ask would be at this point in the game, but I will let her know that this felt like it trampled my boundaries.

We then sent out ""save the date"" letters which included the URL for our wedding site. 

I told my fiance when we got engaged that I was going to ask my brother to be my best man and a family friend to be a groomsman **IN PERSON** instead of phone/text. 

When she was setting up the website she  revealed their roles underneath their photo/names before I got to officially ask them to be my best man / groomsman.

Upon receipt of the letter, my brother &amp; best friend would discover that they were my guests of honor via a website as opposed to hearing it from me in person. This is not how I wanted them to find out. 

I told her I was upset that she revealed this before I got to ask them.

She said ""it's your fault since you had a very long time to ask them. You should have done it by now since I kept reminding you. It's your fault if they saw the site before you asked them""

I responded:

""I told you I wanted to ask them in person, something I can't easily do since they they're far. I was expecting to see them both during Thanksgiving/Christmas season this year.  It doesn't matter how many times you reminded me, why would you put that on the site before telling you they accepted?""

My best friend luckily never got to visit the site and he verbally accepted today since I finally got to see him. My brother on the other hand did see the page of ""wedding crew"" and he saw himself on the page and presumably also saw his role as ""best man"" 

I told her to remove the best man title of my brother until I ask him next week 

My fiance said stop blaming her for this oversight and that I should accept full responsibility for this since I did not ask them sooner. 

When I had initially reviewed the site, I did not notice that she put their roles since I was only checking to see if the site was visually pretty. 

She's also implying that it's not her fault for putting it on the site but it is my fault for not catching something that bothered me. 

She is upset that I am blaming her completely yet she wants to place all the blame on me. The bottom line is she knew I had yet to ask them. 

I had 1 year remaining before the wedding date to ask them so I still had plenty of time to ask them.

My fiancé thinks I'm the asshole for not telling my best man &amp; groomsman that I wanted them to have that honor before she launched our wedding website. 

She thinks I'm an asshole for not realizing that she had assigned them those roles on the website until weeks after she launched the site so I'm responsible for them finding out this way.

(Btw this is important to the story, Matthew is 1 of the smartest students and people I know already learning algebra at a young age and always getting high honors+good scores)


A few years later we were all in the same school yet again since 1st grade, the other girl had a crush on Matthew but she got rejected by him and it was tough since I was always placed in the class the same as Matthew's and Matthew never minded the rumors made abt the other girl .


1 day I was still in tutor and 1 of my guy friends that we will call R was waiting for me to finish my tutor since we would hang out a lot, while R was waiting Matthew decided to approach him and said to R that he would kinda ship both me and R and that was pretty much with no consent either, me &amp; R were friends with common interests and that was it .


To R it didn't seem like that much other then making him feel a teeny bit uncomfy until Matthew decided to bring in naughty stuff and said smth abt us doing the evil bad stuff (he said this while we all were still minors btw) which pretty much set R off like an alarm


After like a year or so R told me abt what happened and it pretty much made me incredibly uncomfy, even more uncomfy then normal since it was incredibly obvious that I was aroace . I had never felt any sort of romantic attraction to anybody and everyone knew that, people would ask me ""do you like somebody?"" And I would always respond with ""no"" .

Ever since I found out I have distanced myself from R feeling uncomfy from what he had told me . I would also decide to distance myself from Matthew which he seemed to notice since I was more agressive to him then my other classmates which I would just treat normally, he asked me 1 day In class ""why aren't you talking to me?"" Which I responded with ""idk"" since I'm not chatty in irl and would talk to only 1 other classmate of mine in school . He said sorry to R abt what happened but to me sorry wouldn't cut it .

I have pretty much hated him ever since and would feel uncomfy getting dragged into anything that has smth to do with him even if he was my childhood bestfriend, when 1 of my friends asked him abt it for me he responded saying it was my fault that we ""weren't friends"" anymore .

He would keep trying to socialize w/ me and talk to me every once in a while to try and ""fix"" the friendship but I just feel it isn't right to do it if he would do something like that to me .

I wanted to do a follow up for my original stories so on Thursday night I did some digging on social media and found out where he was probably at and went to the camp.

She's lovely but incredibly neurotic about her looks and needs constant validation. Recently she's lost a lot of weight, which I'm beginning to worry about as she was already pretty trim and has been incredibly obsessive about her diet and exercise routine. I'm worried that she might now be developing an eating disorder because I suspect she's purging.

She's become pretty close to me (calls me Sis) and now calls my husband 'Bro'.

In recent times, I've noticed that she gets a little clingy on my husband when we are all together. Shell constantly go to where he is, keep showing off her weight loss, talking about her looks and such. Her dressing was always provocative but she's now dialed it up quite a bit. The last two times she's come around, her clothes are so short, her underwear is easily seen. I mentioned that to her.

This past weekend,  she asks to come over again and she's in a see-through lace crop top, only the boob area is fully covered. Extremely short skirt (with underwear easily seen when walking or sitting), high boots that she could barely walk in (she had to hold onto me for support) and a jacket that she draped over her shoulders. She was freezing as the weather has changed but still wouldn't wear the jacket.

She comes in, says hello to both of us then we make our way to the kitchen. She stays hangs out with me for a bit (I was in the kitchen prepping food) and then goes up to where my husband was and stays there until I finally make my way up over half an hour later. Her reasoning is that they might be working together so she wants to hear what his ideas are.

A few friends have made comments about her inappropriate behaviour around my husband. I was mostly willing to give her the benefit of a doubt. I spoke to my husband and he mentioned that he too is sketched out by her behaviour and his friend who came by later also asked him what's going on there and if the girl is hitting on him.

I want to have a conversation with her but don't want to come off as slut shaming or some insecure wife. It's just getting to the point where I think something needs to be said. WIBTA if I tell her off for her behaviour?

I was really excited, blew off a work project, got new heels, a dress, and was excited to be wined and dined. I really did put in a lot of time, money, and energy trying to impress him and be good company.

I didn't ask him about whether he was paying and expected him to pay since he asked me out. When the bill came, he just gave me a blank stare. I asked him if he was taking care of it and he just said ""No"".

I got visibly upset and he started bragging about other women that wanted him, then threatened to get up and leave if I didn't pay. I panicked about being left with the whole bill.

He said we could split it and we both put in our cards. Turns out, he had actually LOCKED his card. The waitress came back and said ""I'm really sorry, his card didn't work"" and she told me my card got charged for BOTH meals.

Wanting to be ""nice"", I didn't complain, I just said that's okay and signed the check, but I'm wondering if this was my legal obligation. Can I complain to the restaurant?

I feel as though it was not fair he bullied me into paying for him and I got screwed over for trying to be a good person and pay my share out of respect for the restaurant, even though it was a date HE asked me on. But then the restaurant charged me for BOTH meals because this guy locked his card.

The guy also seemed very, very pleased with himself that he didn't need to pay and wouldn't leave a tip either, so I had to put down the little cash I had (20) too. It was 100 for both plus tip and this guy refused to pay anything and bullied me into paying for him by locking his card. I'm not sure what else I could have done and feel really bad about the whole thing. Could I have asked to only pay for myself?

ALSO: since my house was down the street from the restaurant, I stupidly let him talk me into ""walking me home"" and then when we got to my door, he said he had to use the bathroom so I stupidly let him inside. He then took his shoes off and tried to stay, and I had to kick him out. Thankfully my 30 year old roommate was there, so the guy sheepishly left when he realized another man was in the house, but I'm worried something terrible could have happened. I'm kind of shocked at my naivety looking back. Could he have bullied me into segs too if my roommate wasn't there?

I trust his decision and I back him 100%. He has chosen to pull back from his mother (our sons grandmother) after a string of incidents his mother has caused, and refuses to even acknowledge. Not only does she not acknowledge them, she refuses to apologise and change the behaviour. 

For further context;

My partner and I haven’t been on a date in 13 months. We didn’t have a baby to have other people change their life to look after him so we could continue doing all the things we were doing childless (not for everyone but that’s what we chose) however, one evening last week, we decided To take the plunge and go out for some dinner and let my mother in law put our son to bed and watch him. When we came home, we were met with the tv on full blast (she’s almost deaf and refuses to admit that also) and the monitor OFF. We simply asked her why the monitor was off. It’s important to us if the tv is on loud, that you be able to see him, as you won’t be able to hear him if he were to wake. (For further context, she is a fan of the CIO method which my partner and I are NOT). She said “I’ll hear him”. (Debatable) but either way, we asked for her to put it on before we left, as it’s important to US. It’s not a hard task. It’s not a big ask. There have been other incidents too where she has just been completely irresponsible and yesterday it came to a head. She gave the baby full grapes, uncut, massive grapes, and let him run around with them. When my partner found a whole grape on the floor he simply asked “mum, why is this here”. “Oh the baby had them”. I’m sure if a person could have steam coming out of their ears, my partner had it. He tried to talk to her calmly, and say, no. You do not give full grapes, a choking hazard to a baby. To which she replied “I’ve raised my own children, and he is not a baby”. Both, totally ridiculous points to what we are asking. Yes he is a baby. And you have raised your own children, yes. But she has openly admitted to me in the past she would let my partner cry it out and deprive him of milk and push him to go 5 hours without breast milk when he was a newborn. That is NOT how we do patenting. 

Anyway, it turned into an argument, to which she said to my partner, “if the baby comes with a set of instructions, I won’t have him at all”. This is her only grandchild by the way. 

So my partner left, and told her, ok, you won’t see him, or us, again.

So this has really been playing on my mind and I really have to ask if I’m in the wrong here… I have 2 sisters, I am the middle child. While my younger sister and I have worked since we turned 16 and until recently (I lost my job earlier this year). My older sister however has happily popped out kids to claim HUGE benefits. Between her and her bf they are in pretty shady stuff, such as theft from his work where they sell all the stuff for extra money. He’s also a prescription drug addict! He has been in my home and stolen my tablets and I’ve made it clear he is not allowed round anymore. Now my current issue… I went out for lunch with my sisters a few weeks back and big sister offered to pay, which I repeatedly thanked her for. Anyways I got a call after my sister dropped her home saying how the whole way back she bragged about her paying and me struggling! I will admit i am struggling but in no way does that mean i’m okay being spoken about like I’m a scrounger from someone who does nothing but sit at home spending OUR fucking taxes! Something she appears to do regardless of the situation. She goes shopping and offers to buy a couple things for my sisters dog and she tells EVERYONE who will listen about how anyone gets stuff and how she bought it, they need the help etc! She’s tried inviting me again for lunch a few times since then and I am refusing to do anything where she is there. I can not be mentally bothered with feeling inadequate and financially unstable despite always working hard from the day I could yet she gets EVERYTHING handed to her and is basically living high on money she doesn’t deserve!

During dinner, I asked him again if everything is okay. Since he has been very quiet, barely talked to me. He kept saying ""it's nothing. It's nothing he hasn't said before.""

I know then he was mad at me. There was something I did. I asked want did I do this time? What did I do wrong? 

He just kept repeating""it's nothing he hasn't said before. If I had to ask what I did wrong, then there's no point saying.""

She’s a stay at home wife and we have no children of our own. She has a daughter from a previous relationship (Sarah) and we’ve gotten along for the most part. Sarah is a junior in college and pursuing a biology degree with additional courses required by medical schools. She’s had dream of being a doctor and helping people since her mom and I met. The problem is she’s not a very good student. 

She’s failed her biology 1 class and had to retake it to get a B. She really struggled in her next level biology class and finished with a C. She also got a C in her chemistry class. She got a B in calculus 1 and 2. She’s making A’s in her none science and none math classes so they’re padding her GPA which is at a 3.2. This semester I just learned she will make B’s and C’s in her science and math classes. I’m not a doctor and I don’t know any doctors but I did online research. I found out that medical schools require many things but at the top of the list they is a high GPA and top grades in science and math classes. With Sarah’s grades, she’s not getting into any medical school. I even looked into nursing school to see if I can talk her into going that route and all the ones I looked at require higher grades than what she has.

I talked with my wife about it and she said medical school looks at other things besides grades and that’s where Sarah excels. She has a solid volunteer resume and she’s cares about people. I argued none of that matters if her grades are not good enough. She argues that Sarah will do great in the interviews. Like I said, I have no experience with medical school so I can’t argue with her logic. Instead, I talked with Sarah when she came home for thanksgiving and told her to look into another major because she might not be cut out to be a doctor. She ran to her mom and we all got into a huge argument. I admit I lost my temper and yelled I’m not wasting any more money on something she’ll fail at. I told them both I’m not paying for next semester’s classes unless she changes her major to something more realistic.

I feel bad, I really do but I’m not rich and I don’t have money to waste if she doesn’t have a chance to get into medical school.

(Names and places made up) 

Ok so me (f25) have a friend (f25) which we will call Jay. Jay has been seeing there partner (NB26) let’s call them Gray, for a little over 9 months. 


They met on a through mutual friends and really hit it off! But since about month three I have began to get worried about what I think are red flags? For example:
-Making hurtful jokes at Jays expense such as calling them a useless b- while laughing and turning it into a joke and ‘joking’ about aggressively flirting with other people. 
-Lying and saying they weren’t there or didn’t do something such as lying and saying they weren’t at Jays house when Jay has proof they were 
-Ignoring Jays feeling or brushing them off when she tries to talk about how Grays actions hurt her 

And these are just some that happened  recently. 

Jay is very sensitive, forgiving and blames herself ALOT. And whenever something bad between her and Gray happens she often comes to me crying or close to it. In the beginning I tried to offer advice such as communicating better, but it would continue. I began to start telling Jay to stop forgiving Grays actions no matter how much they love them. But jay still forgave them. 

A little more recently I began to tell them (whenever they would come to me) to break up with Gray as the relationship is obviously not healthy, Jay somewhat agrees and recognises some of Grays actions as bad. But says they love them too much/ don’t want to be lonely and that it’s not really that bad and they don’t want to break up with them anyway. So I’m beginning to wonder if maybe I’m just overreacting and/or being irrational so....

I’m Asian. My parents are PhD’s and came here for grad school. I was born and raised in the American South (liberal college town in a red state). I lean left on most issues and I am a registered democrat.

Situation: I am back in my hometown this week for thanksgiving. I met up with a few friends from high school at a local sports bar to watch the NFL early slate of games this afternoon. Most of these friends are liberals/moderates but there’s one who is staunchly conservative (bordering on Q level stuff). He is white and was a goofball in high school and didn’t go to college and works random gig jobs (eg Uber, doordash, etc) in our home town. We mostly talked about the NFL and our professional/personal lives but also discussed the midterms over the course of a few hours while drinking beer and eating wings. I wasn’t drunk but I was a bit tipsy.

A commercial for the World Cup came on. Another friend started talking about the US’s chances of getting out of the group. I said something along the lines of: “we really need to win that opening game against Wales tomorrow, England will be a tough matchup for us, we don’t want to leave it to the last day”

Conservative friend then says “why are you saying ‘we’. You’re not even a real American. Shouldn’t you be rooting for China or Korea or what ever?”

I’m pissed and go off on a semi-drunk rant (paraphrasing): “Shut the fuck up im more American than you. What do you even do again? I paid more in taxes last year than you even made. Why the fuck would you say I’m not American? I got a 5 on the AP US history test a few years ago didn’t you drop out of that class because you couldn’t handle the readings? Fucking douchebag don’t say shit about me until you’re on my level.”

Conservative friend just says “fuck you im outta here” and leaves. Other friends there don’t agree with what he did but said I went too far by personally attacking him and his lack of financial success/educational prowess.

So I'm a stay at home mom with 3 kids. My husband works full time and gets an okay- salary BUT he's tightened the grip on spending for the past 4 months to be able to save up to go watch the football event overseas. He's literally obssessed with anything to do with football. He said he rarely ever gets to do what he wants and so I didn't want to judge him since it's his money eventually.


We discussed plans for christmas and he told me to handle everything since he won't be back til Dec. 20th. He told me he had put aside money for christmas decoration, food, gifts, kids needs etc. The money in total was 100$. I was completely shocked I told him 100$ for an entire family's christmas celebration was ridiculously not enough. He shrugged saying it's all he's got but I pointed out how he's paying for his friend's and his girlfriend's travel expenses. He told me to just ""take it"" but I said that if he decided to leave me with just 100 bucks then I won't be doing anything for christmas. We had lots of arguments and couldn't get this resolved.



He's in Qatar now (he left days ago). Yesterday, while I was cleaning I found an envelope with the same 100$ and a note from him telling me ""to make it work"". I sent him a message that I've decided that I won't be doing anything for christmas with this little money, period. He was livid he just kept sending an angry message after another calling me ""spoiled"" and telling me to stop expecting to live like I was still living in my parents house and to stop trying to ""rob"" the kids of enjoying the holidays like the other kids.

Few days ago once again she came round. While my wife was feeding the baby my sister looked around for the formula we were using. We use cow&amp;gate. She started berating my wife for using such an expensive brand. My wife was clearly gonna cry if she didn’t shut up. I may of overreacted a bit and told her to get the fuck out of my house.

I (22NB) looked after my little brother (14M) for three and a bit days over the weekend, Thursday-Sunday. My parents (F51 and (M52) came back around tea time on the Sunday hence the bit XD. My parents were away working at a craft show and it was easier and cheaper for them to stay over nearby rather than drive backwards and forwards. I also watched my mums shop for three days (Thursday-Saturday) when she was away.

The problem being there wasn’t a lot of food in the house (mainly just pasta, cheese, rice etc but it gets repetitive eating the same thing night after night) that I could prepare easily after work (I got the bus at 8:15AM and returned to the house sometime between 4-6PM at night). Meaning before I got in the bus I had to run to Lidl or Iceland to pick something quick and easy up for tea. Paying with it out of my own savings (I also have a full time job I took time off to help out). My parents didn’t leave any kind of money to help out when she was away, and when the shopping came on Friday there was barely anything in it (just milk, two super noodles, a pizza, cereal bars, pita breads and biscuits) as they forgot to add to the shopping on Thursday.

They do do a lot for me, picking me up from work (I usually finish at 10 and the buses stop at 8 but I am changing my availability to reflect the bus times). I also pay rent to them (£200 a month and I’ve offered to pay more if needed).

My grandmother is very judgemental if things don’t fit into her “perfect picture” and I feel like I have to preform anytime I’m around my family. I have recently moved into my own house with my 2yr old son Elliot after  living with my foster carers for 3 years. They have been there everyday since Elliot was born and are honorary grandparents. I speak to them everyday and they’re the first I call when I forget how to cook sausages lol. 
My family are pressuring me to spend Christmas with them but things always go wrong and I’m always the one that walks away crying. However when Christmas came around at my foster placement, there were no issues. Everyone was happy. Everyone was relaxed. Whereas things are always tense with my family. Everything has to be perfect. Everyone has to act perfect. And more often than not, I fall out with my sister (10f) and my mother always defends her. Favourite child stuff. I just want a peaceful Christmas, that’s all I want. 
So I made the decision that I’ll be going back to my foster carers for Christmas. When I told my mother this, she immediately turned cold as she usually is and started guilt tripping me about how the family haven’t spent a single Christmas with Elliot yet. My mother has never liked how Elliot is closer to my foster carers than he is to her and I understand that but I don’t want to take that relationship between Elliot and my foster carers away. 
I talked to my aunt (mothers sister) about this and she told me not to stress about it, spend Christmas with whoever makes you happy. She understands how exhausting and mentally draining family events are. However I’m wondering if I’m somehow in the wrong for choosing to spend Christmas with “people who got paid to look after me” (grandmothers words) instead of my actual family.

I (25F) graduated from college 2 years ago straight into the pandemic. My two best friends (also 25Fs) from college and I were planning to take a grad trip together, obviously these plans were scuppered by the pandemic. Back in June when things started to ease up where we live we started planning a trip to make up for our missed grad trip. Our plan was to fly to London on 22 Dec and fly home on 6 Jan. We're all busy working full-time now, so I was really excited to spend time with them again and do our long postponed grad trip. I'm not a fan of travelling generally speaking, but I was just thrilled I'd be travelling *with my friends.*

One of my friends who is going on the trip started dating someone new a month ago. I've only met her boyfriend twice because like I said, we're all busy. So it was a huge surprise to me yesterday when she suddenly said she wanted to bring him along on our trip. She said he'd pay for his own ticket and other expenses, and it'd be good to have a guy with us in a foreign country for 'safety reasons', and she wanted to spend more time with him because he'll be busy next year, etc.

I'm not gonna lie, I was PISSED. I told her straight up that it was super shitty to spring this on us a month before our trip, and honestly hurtful that she wanted to bring a new boyfriend on a trip that was meant to be for the three of us who've been friends for 6 years, a trip that's already been postponed 2 years. She *knows* I don't enjoy travelling and the whole reason why I agreed/was excited was to spend time having fun with two of my best friends in a way we haven't done since college. After some arguing I said if she insisted on doing this I would just cancel my ticket, she could go with her boyfriend and our other friend, and if she actually wanted to spend time just as the three of us, we could arrange another holiday sometime next year.

By the time we got to the restaurant I was heated. So as we were waiting with the adult kids and his mom, I said let me see your phone, he said no. So I turned around to the kids and his mom and said  ""He was texting another girl and won't show me his phone and deleted it."" I know...not their business.(I have apologized to them and won't talk about this anymore withbthem)We sat down and I said what's her name if I have nothing to worry about. He said it's not the time, I had a moment of clarity and agreed. I sat there silently crying when I had to go outside to wait in the car.

When we got home, I told him all he has to do is show me his phone, so I can see who you were texting, prove me wrong so I can apologize and we can talk. He refused, said I was blowing this out of proportion and he needed to go away to think. I said If you don't show me, this is over. I said then don't come back. He left. We have life 360 and his phone hasn't been off, so I know he went to his moms and hasn't left. But now I don't know what to think.

 My parents asked if I was visiting for Thanksgiving. Although I have a couple days off for the holiday I don't want to make the journey for one day of visit and 2 travel days to be right back at work so I told them I'm just staying home. They're pretty sad but they said they understand and for me to get rest.

 A couple days after my parents asked me when the next time I'll be home is and I told them I'd be home in a couple months and that I plan on visiting a lot less because of experiencing burnout. Again they're disappointed but understanding and are just hoping that the visits dont stop all together. My siblings have also all been sending me texts about them missing me and they can't wait to see me and how thanksgiving wont be the same without me. 

 I know they all love me and miss me but any time I'm not working and sadness being expressed that I'm not coming home is starting to make me feel a bit like an asshole.

Apologies ahead of time for Grammer.

Some background...I haven't been very close to my brother throughout the years including childhood. But we still talked during holidays and the occasional few lines of text messaging through the year. 

Sometime in may 2021 he had came to me asking to borrow money. His reason was to pay some fee for a car downpayment. He has been having difficulties with child custody and child support payments. I was hesitant to borrow it and he could tell. I didn't want to borrow it initially because I was worried about family drama and not getting it back because I know he owes a lot of debt. Well...I borrowed the money to him..3k. He was great full and told me this elaborate plan to pay it back and even gave me an exact amount he'd pay monthly. He paid for the first 4 months and after that nothing.  I didn't ask about it because I'm to awkward with talking about money to anyone besides my SO.

Now I feel I'm the AH in this situation because I've asked him every 2 or 3 months if he was going to pay me back still and his reply was a simple yes. Then radio silence. I would repeat cycle until the present day. I personally felt like I needed some kind of explanation or just a simple ""hey I can't pay you back for a few months can we talk about this in 3 months from now because I have x amount to pay for bills/fees/debt"". Another reason I feel like I'm the AH is because he is overseas in the military and probably going through some tough shit but tbh I don't really know because he won't tell me but I see him post snapchats with him and his buddies.

Finally, after asking him this last time...a straightforward message ""why haven't you paid me back yet?"" He proceeded to call me names and wished me a fucked up life and never talk to him again.

I (F22), have 3 friends, F(F21), R(M22) and G(M21). We all have known each other since we were 8/9 yo.

So the thing is that for the pasts weeks I’ve been trying to replicate a cake recipe, in order to prepare it correctly on my bd, which was Nov/18. This recipe is really special for me, since it’s my dad’s, and he prepared it for me every year. Sadly my dad, died on a car accident, 10 months ago. So this would be my first bd without him, and I wanted to have him “present” that day.

The recipe is really “simple”. It’s a chocolate cake with strawberries and coffee. However it has a lot of steps, and I am not good at baking. R offered to help me, he isn’t that good but he knows more than me. So every Wednesday I’d go to his house and we would try to recreate the “Chocolate menace” (That’s how R named it). 

Those weeks were kinda rough, we had very terrible failures. But in the end we were able to have a decent replicate. That day we invited G and F to have a try and they loved it.

So a day before my bd I asked for R's help. The cake looked amazing and I was really excited for it. Well, my bd arrives and we have a small get-together in my house. We are all having a great time. Then it’s time to cut the cake, I go for it and I find it looking weird. I turn it around and realize that at least half of the cake it’s gone. 

I go to the living room and ask if someone took a piece of cake. I was really mad, and I could feel some tears on my cheek. F tells me that we could buy another one. That only makes me more mad and again ask, who took a piece. Finally G confessed, but told me that I was making a scene for nothing. I just lose it and yell at him to get out. 

After that some of my friends left, and R tried to cheer me up by telling me he would bake another one for me. However, G and F sent me passive aggressive dms of how crazy i acted over a cake. Some of my other friends agree with them, while R and others tell me i wasn’t in the wrong.

Me and the friends that came to visit went to a small town in the middle of nowhere to let them see their family (I was driving bc none of them have a license) I looked on maps and I had already driven 3hrs 30 (281km)
and if I had gone to the birthday that would have been  approximately 6hrs 30 of just driving (450km). 

I had no wifi or service in the small town, but I knew where the birthday was and could’ve driven there. My other friend said I was an asshole for not even telling them I couldn’t come and that it wasn’t fair on the birthday girl, 
In my defence I never talk to the birthday girl and that’s soo far to drive especially bc it was heavy raining and it was dark… not to mention gas…. not only that but how could I have told them I wasn’t coming, I had no service or wifi when I decided I couldn’t come. I said sorry and explained I got caught up and she’s still mad. She said I knew about the party weeks in advance and could have told them I wasn’t coming but how could I have known my other friends would surprise me the same day???

I(13) my mom, brother, sister, older cousin(32), her 2 kids,  and younger cousin (12) lets call her tracy. were all at Universal because we had the year passes. If you've ever been to Universal, you'd know that there is 2 levels. It takes like 5 escalators to get down, and there is also the same amount of stairs. Remember that. When we were all finished with the lower deck(we decided to do that level first) me and tracy wanted to take the stairs. Fine right. Ok, so my mom tells tracy meet them at the top with me. Remember top.  So the 6 of them go all the way to the top of the level. They go up 6 escalators and are already at the top.Me and tracy are waiting and waiting at the top of the first escalator. We kept on trying to look for them but we couldn't find them. After about 10 minutes or so I'm like let's just go to the top level. She said no, we have to stay down here because she said wait at the top. I couldn't split up with her because you don't do that obviously. Anyways so we finally decide to go down the escalator to the security umbrella. It took 30 minutes for my mom to answer her damn phone. I was even calling her too. So they finally find us and down the elevator comes 4 over it kids, and 2 angry woman. I'm not kidding from 50 feet away, my older cousin starts screaming. I don't even know why she's literally nobody's mom. Like scream at your own kids tf? Anyways as she's screaming at the top of her lungs along with my mom I tell her to shhhh naturally. Why wouldn't I? She goes DiD you jUsT ShOosH mE? Like yes, you're screaming at me. People were staring and she asked me how old I was and then proceeded to tell me its not about age. She said you think you're old enough and cool enough. No, tf. I was trying to tell her that tracy wouldn't let me to the top, but she wouldn't listen. Ofc nobody yells at tracy bc everyone in my family thinks I'm a fuck up from l shit I did when I was 7. Once she stopped running her mouth we started to all go up the escalator and go to another ride. While we were walking, me and tracy obviously distant lengthwise hear her say ""you want to get embarrassed, I'll give you something to be embarrassed about."" Pissed me off so i told my tracy ""she embarrassed herself"" and we both started laughing. 5 minutes later my mom tells me I gotta respect my older cousin. No bro respect goes both ways. We finally got onto the other ride and tracy starts crying and my sister tells me that my older cousin told my mom to scream at us. Anyways my family thinks I was wrong for talking back and shooshing her. AITA? Note: this was like 6 months ago and me and tracy are still very mad at my older cousin, and the older cousin won't even give me a full hug anymore at parties which idrc, but what I do care about is that's she does for tracy.

So here goes. 

My sister (18f) came back from work screaming the house down, it was only me(20f) and my partner(22m) and my sister's partner (18m) in the house. So I went down after about 5 mins of it and asked my sis "" hey what's going on, you alright?"" I got no response, this caused me to just close the kitchen door so she would have some privacy and went upstairs. When I closed the door she then shouted ""oh piss off then"" to which I replied ""alright, okay then"" and this prompted her to chase me upstairs and I went into my room ignoring her.

She went back down to the kitchen retrieved washing up I had yet to do and put it outside my door while name-calling which I then, Brought back down. Here she starts yelling at me for not washing up yet. I told her ""I'm not gonna do it whilst you're in here stropping"" along with ""you aren't my mother"" type comments. she was effing and blinding at this point and turnt and threw stuff from the sink at me, I managed to close the door in time and she charged at me again threatening me, this is where I may be the AH, I told her that if she's seriously going to try to attack and threaten people whilst pregnant then she's being a ""negligent mother"" as she knows other people will not retaliate and she does have a history of assaulting her ex's (last two at I know of at least) so I know she can be aggressive aswell as attacking myself before multiple times when I am a lot bigger than her (5'5 and 5,9) so I don't want her to put herself in these situations. 

Anyway, her bf then comes in telling me and my bf that I shouldn't have said that and got very close shouting at me to take it back, I tried to explain to him why I said such things and that I'm sorry it upset the two of them but it's sadly true, he then shouted and told me that I was pissing him off ect. I understand hormones and stuff aren't great and I've been doing everything I can to support the two of them,but knowing her history (haven't told her new bf/unborn babys dad her history dw) but aita for the two quotes ""you need to work on your anger management while pregnant"" and the negligent mother comment?
