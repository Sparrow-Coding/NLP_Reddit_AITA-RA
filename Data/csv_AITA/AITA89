She moved out 3 years later (their divorce took 10 years, I’m dead fucking serious it was a disaster). 

When she moved out my mom decided she was polyamorous. Now as an adult, I don’t mind it. Not for me, but different strokes for different folks. Except for my mom that was having a rotation of anywhere from 2 to 5 men steadily in and out of the house. I’d get up for school and there’d be a strange man over in my house for breakfast, and then come home from school to a totally different guy eating my pop tarts. I guess my mom was having a mid life crisis, she’d be out at bars till 3AM, come home with a rando and drag me out of bed to hang out with her. When I asked her what sex was, she took condoms out of her purse, tossed them at me and that was that. I ended up moving in with my dad full time bc my mom was a nut, and she also inadvertently killed my hamster (unrelated but traumatizing). 

Now as an adult my mom and I have a calmer but superficial relationship. I swung by on thanksgiving and her new-ish monogamous s/o was there. We’re chatting about something in my childhood and it led to me making a joke about her having a ‘binder full of men’ when I was a kid. My mom gets horribly offended and asks why I would say such a thing. I remind her she had a steady stream of random men in and out of the house, multiple times a day. Well apparently s/o didn’t know that, my mom is pissed, I didn’t realize he didn’t know my mom had banged half the city.

During the period I made sure to tell students I was available with any questions they had about the project and answered and gave examples for those who asked. However, a bunch of students chose not to use their time effectively and played on their phones, watched movies or played games on their computers. These are the same students who have done this all year. At this point I decided not to intervene and to simply let them waste their own time and fail. When the missing project caused a lot of them drop to a failing grade I got many angry emails from parents. I explained that they had two full hours to complete the project in class and an additional week at home. I explained the consequences of not turning the project in to the students AND parents and still this occurred and that class time should’ve been more effectively used instead of doing other things.

I’ve known them for long enough to know about their past relationships in detail and their maturity when it comes to it. Most of them are very immature and/or they only want to play around (based on stories they told me, no judgments or assumptions). 

I’m gonna give you some examples just so you guys understand where I’m coming from. One of my guy friends has been in multiple relationships, he literally lost count. He is very obsessive and controlling and has very severe jealousy issues. He’s the type of guy that would tell you he’s in love with you after a week of talking (literally). What makes it even worse is that he’s not aware that what he does is unhealthy. All the girls end up leaving him and he genuinely thinks that they’re the problem. He thinks he’s in love with every girl he talks to, and when they do end up leaving him he moves on to the next girl in a matter of 24 hours (again, literally) and claims he’s in love with her after a week of talking, if she doesn’t he eventually gets bored and he ghosts them. And the cycle goes on. 

One of my girl friends used to have a boyfriend and she used to cheat on him with 3 dudes at the same time. She now claims she’s in love with a guy, yet she’s still flirting and engaging in sexual activities with other men, including a guy i used to have a thing with which bothers me so much because…i used to like him bro like cmon. and the list goes on. 

I’m the type who doesn’t like to mix friend groups for reasons some of you may understand. I always hated when a friend started hitting on another friend from a separate friend group and i never understood why. Don’t get me wrong if they genuinely like each other, and i’m sure no party would get hurt in the process (like cheating, leading on etc., not normal break ups and relationships problems) I would support them and be happy for them 100%. But some of my friends ask me if its ok to do so and i say no because i know that they’re gonna hurt them. For example the guy friend I told u about previously wanted to hit on a friend of mine that has bpd and she’s already going through enough struggles when it comes to relationships and men, so I know he’s gonna hurt her for obvious reasons. He then started calling me a pick me and a cork blocker for not allowing him to do so.

I know i have no right to decide for my friends, but will i really be a good friend if i allow my friends to get involved in relationships that i know for a fact will end in tragedy?

In the beginning of October I decided that I should book with her for my upcoming trip overseas for my sisters wedding. I told her I wanted to book for the end of November and she told me that she's busy and will get back to me. Two days later she apologiesed for not getting back to me. She gave me her available dates and I booked for the end of November. The dates she gave me were as she had the Sunday as a different date (which I didn't double check, I just assumed it was right) so I booked for Sunday the 28th. 

She got me to pay a $30 deposit and the remaining balance was $30. So $60 in total. 

Anyways, a while back she sent me a message saying that she's going to charge me $15 more because I'm late. I was confused because that wasn't the day I booked. She apologised. Again I thought, it's okay, things happen. 

I then realised the dates she told me were wrong and that the 28th was not the Sunday but a Monday. I told her the dates she sent were wrong and I wanted to do the Sunday if that was ok. 

She never replied, and two days after I asked for a follow up. Then she says that she's going to take a break from doing her business because her business isn't doing that well. I told her that I understand that I hope things get better for her. I

Then the next day, she sends another message saying she actually will do my eyelashes on the Sunday the 27th, if I'm still interested. She then sends me information on the date, location, and total amount I needed to pay, but the total amount was now $75. 

I was kind of annoyed, but because I was unsure if I'd find anywhere else to do them, I told her that I'll still go to her to do them. 

But now, the day of my appointment, she sends a message saying she has to cancel again because her daughter is sick and that we can reschedule for next weekend. I won't be in the country next weekend. 

I was really annoyed and told that well I understand her daughter is sick and I hope her daughter is okay, I booked far in advance to make sure I would be able to do my lashes and that even if I wasn't leaving the country, that I don't want to reschedule because I'm unsure she'll just cancel on me again. I said that it seems like she can't be bothered with her business, and that I'll never book with her again and she's completely wasted my time.

I get things happen and I try to understand and put myself in their shoes, but at this point it's just problem after problem.

Got them jobs at a high paying service job, and subsidized their rent by agreeing to pay a portion for a year since I've been saving by living with an aunt.

One friend lost the job I got him, so i offered to cover his rent for 2 months

He got a better job 2 weeks later. I still covered 2 months of bills, to help him build up security funds.

One friend voluntarily enlisted but he didn't tell his housemate or me until after he signed the papers. Now he is asking me to take his spot in the house so he isn't liable for the subsidized rent payment when deployed.

I found out my other friend no longer wants to stay in the new state on account of trying this out, learning a lot, and wanting to be back around his friends and family in the hometown for his mental health.

In total I've spent $8000 for my friends to help get them started in the new city. Gave equity in my company to compensate bc no cash flow yet.

I don't want them to be unhappy or force them Into any situations. When we originally came up with the idea to have them move out here, I waited 4 months until I was asked repeatedly before helping them move. I only agreed to spend so much money on them because I was willing to lose it, I thought that they were willing to uproot their lives because they were willing to build something with me and try something new. Now I'm at the point where they've shown me their level of commitment.

I try to put this in perspective: I lived elsewhere before moving to where we all met, and then moved again 3x after for college and beyond. These guys haven't had the chance to live elsewhere than where they grew up and never got to go to college. I feel like I should have realized that their request was half baked - even after 4 months - and advised them to think on it more instead of indulging and financing their move. 

AITA for helping engineer this situation? WIBTA if I told my other friend to move back when the first guy deploys so he doesn't have to wait out the lease? I wouldn't have to subsidize their rent anymore after this and they wouldn't need me to add a bill on myself and take the leftover spot.  WIBTA if I got rid of their stake in my company now before they have a chance to put any work in - especially considering both have expressed that they're not willing to be physically present to help in the long-term? My friend who wants to move home would have to leave his new job, where he is making the most money he ever has, and I don't wanna force him into unemployment when he's not ready.

For context I have been broken up with my ex for maybe more than half a year now.The excuse I gave him was ,because we were drifting apart ,but truthfully it was because of all the lying,miscommunication,and immaturity that was always overlooked.
 
After my ex and I separated I heard he got into a new relationship which wasn’t surprising ,but I honestly didn’t care because at that point I blocked him.Turns out though he does have a new girlfriend ,who not only knows about me ,but hates my guts.My friend had sent me screenshots of her insulting me publicly without even knowing me.

When reading what she said I was in utter disbelief at the stupidity.The basic three things she said was “She emotionally scared him” “He had dark thoughts about what she said” and “She was never there for him I was”.

In truth I supported the guy a bunch ,and I didn’t cause him to have dark thoughts he also struggled with it and I encouraged him to get some professional help for because relying on me to help him improve won’t work.The worst part about this is that the reason I’m not there for him isn’t even my fault.When we broke up I still supported him as a friend trying I cheer him up and ask him if he ever needed space ,but he kept crying and and mopping about how he’ll never find someone new and he’ll always love me.I felt reallyyy guilty and terrible so I gave him a ultimatum which was basically “don’t cross my boundaries and focus on improvement” if he did that for a whole month he can decide what put relationship can be.

During this time he complimented me said he loved me ,even saying how he’d never fall for someone new since I’m his dream girl.I hated the relationship we had though and felt dirty but assumed maybe it would work out.After maybe to weeks he admitted he liked a girl for a few days now but didn’t want to tell me because he wanted to be sure while still saying he loved me.I was furious he made go through something so stupid out of guilt so even though he was crying his eyes out saying he was sorry I felt nothing when I blocked him and I still feel nothing for him now.

I don’t care about his issues and will never say sorry for what his new girlfriend is accusing me off.What I will do though is contact my ex and tell him that he crazy girlfriend won’t leave me alone and if he doesn’t stop her I’ll tell everyone he knows the true reason we broke up.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4826518,public,top,self,AITA For Emotionally Scaring My Now Ex And Not Caring One Bit.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z56fu0/aita_for_emotionally_scaring_my_now_ex_and_not/,all_ads,6,

I study in one city but every other weekend i go to my hometown, where my bf lives (2h-drive). (english not my 1st language, sorry for any mistakes)

My grandparent (father of my father) was in the hospital for the last couple of months. He passed away this Thursday. We were not very close to my dad's side of the family since they live about 3 hours from us. But nonetheless I felt sad for the whole situation and even more sad for my dad's loss.

When I heard the news i sent a message to my bf and he called me right away. He was being very supportive. He had a padel game with some friends that night which he called off immediately although I said it was not necessary since I wanted to spend the night with my family at home. That afternoon I drove to my homwetown along with my dad.

My parents left to the city where my grandfather used to live on Friday morning leaving me to take care of my sister (14F). They left me with a small list os chores I have to do (e.g. take my sister to dance classes, grocery shopping, re-arrange some doctor appointments).

My sister's dance classes started at 7PM and the school is a bit far from where we live, I asked my bf to drive us there (we only have 1 car and my parents took it). He was OK with leaving us there but he had John's bday dinner at 8PM so he couldn't leave us at my house after, since my sister's dance class only finish at 8:45PM. I was disappointed. In the previous day he cancelled the padel match without me asking for it and he said he would be there if i needed him. and when i needed him he was off to a friends party. In the end i asked a aunt of mine to get me and my sister and leave us at my house.

Today (Saturday) is my grandfather funeral day (which I will not be attending, since my mum said it wasnt necessary and i dont know how to deal with death). Me and my sister are staying in our house. I needed some groceries and was thinking about asking my bf but apparently he went to play football with his friends the whole morning and was not available to help me out. He invited me to go bowling with his friends this afternoon (""Ryan's"" bday) which I refused. He has already let me know that he wont be available this night since Ryan is having a dinner bday at his house and my bf wants to go.

I feel irritated and he knows i'm mad at him. He says i dont want his support just his rides. And i say that for me, his support is to help me out with my things since i dont have a car and depend on it.

AITA for being mad at my bf for not helping me with my chores while i am grieving?

We've been through a lot. I was friends with her sister first before I became good friends with her. We grew up in church together so we had the same circle of friends.

She met her boyfriend in a beach where she was vacationing 3-4 years ago. They're in a long distance relationship right now because of her boyfriend's work. He's working abroad. She's currently visiting him in Taiwan and he proposed. My friend changed her status on Facebook from in a relationship to engaged last night while I was at church attending the young adults service.

Throughout their relationship, there are plenty of red flags. My friend admits that she's frustrated with his attitude and his perception about things. He can also be sexist and territorial at times which is annoying. I got honest with her about her boyfriend one day. I told her that what her boyfriend does is the same thing that my dad did to my mom. The patterns are the same. And when the pastor is giving advice regarding marriage on a Sunday, they make sure to give advice to those who are in a relationship/engaged as well. And the advice that was given hits her so much. I said I know how we want to hope for the best in our relationships, but let's not brush off the red flags because that will bite us one day. 

I'm in no position to say she should break up with the boyfriend, I know that. But when I saw the status change on Facebook, I was surprised that she said yes because she's conflicted a lot of times when she's opening up to me. I am happy that she's entering a new season in her life, I'm just not as excited as I should be. I want to celebrate this upcoming chapter extravagantly with her but I'm not really at peace.

Thanksgiving Day, and the adults are in chill mode. Dominoes, spades, drinking, shit talking. The conversation moves on to Kevin Samuels (a story for another time) and the devil that is SINGLE MOTHERS. Even worse, single mothers, and the simps who love them. 

Cousins Shane and Stanley (both male, 30s) POV:

""Only a simp would raise someone else's kids""
""She should've chosen better""
""Russell Wilson is a simp! He's raising Future's son""
""This is why we date out. No man wants to be a step-dad. Black women have too many kids!""

Cousin Scarlet and I, who are both single mothers; however, I'm married and she's dating (30s, female) POV:

""You don't have to date a single mother; but why shame them?""
""Love can cause us to ignore red flags; but let's not act like toxic, manipulative people wear badges proclaiming it""
""There's no single mother without a single father. One parent took accountability, and stayed to raise the child""

""A man who steps in to cherish someone's children as his own is a good man. Not better, but a good man

""Yes, there are too many children being born into unstable family structures. They should know. Most of us grew up in fatherless homes. We know the feeling of being without that TV dad to play catch with us. We saw those ""get a dad"" TV movies and wanted a dad. How can they trash a man who fulfilled that child's wish? ""

The men called us emotional; and they brought up lions killing unrelated cubs. Scarlet and I responded with animals that rescue, nurse and adopt other species. 

Then, it got personal. Shane said that I was ""just lucky that I found a man to simp for me (he adopted my daughter) and be ""Captain Save a 304"". I told Shane that he was just bitter because he was too ugly and too dumb of a child for anyone to want to be his real dad, or his step-dad. I told him not even the football coach wanted to be his father figure. 

I guess I hit a nerve. Shane showed away from the table and went for a walk. Stanley told me I hit below the belt and went after Shane. Scarlet said she was with me until I essentially called Shane a bastard. I reminded her that we all are, and Scarlet said it's different for a man.

Also their kids live with us as well. Adds up to 8 people in a three bedroom house before we got evicted, yes evicted. Our landlord was very racist and made it seem like we were selling drugs because of how many people come in and out our house. 

Mind you I have a boyfriend that would visit, my nephew and nieces father would come and get the kids and drop them off, and I had friends picking me up to go places. The only reason they actually won was because we had a messy basement because it was a lot of storage down there. 

After getting evicted I moved in with my boyfriend’s mother. I told her it was temporary and she was ok with it. As long as I try and find a place and don’t get lazy. I got a new job working with my boyfriend which my family actually didn’t like. They believe we would get sick of each other and it’s not a good idea. (My sisters and mom have no job btw) I started going out more with my boyfriend which they also had a problem with. They felt like I spent too much time with him and I should ask before I go anywhere. 

For a while they stopped trying to force me to do what they wanted and I have been pretty good. 

Recently they found a place but because my mom has that eviction now it’s hard for her to get the apartment. She asked me to put my name on the lease and at first I agreed. I was doing everything I need to do to get it. All of a sudden she started asking for more and more money. 

I agreed to get the moving truck for them but that was it. Now they ask for the deposit? Then when I didn’t have it in time I was told by the person they are staying with that they were planing on replacing me with. Someone else and I can’t have the room I picked out. Then I found out it can affect my credit. 

At that point I was ready to filing my own place, then my boyfriend said we should start looking for apartments for together. I agreed and we have been looking for apartments together for the last few days. My family had found out and now are completely ignore me and won’t talk to me. Told me I am a horrible person because I won’t do this for them.

They do that every time I don’t want to do stuff I’m not comfortable with it’s frustrating on so many levels.

 I decided I don’t want to help people who don’t respect me at all. They expect me to do what they want without wanting me to feel some type of way.

Back in June I went to an MCR concert in Warrington with my partner and some friends. For context: Warrington is a fairly large town in the UK, placed roughly in between the cities of Liverpool and Manchester. 

The concert was amazing; it was outdoors and we managed some spots pretty close to the front. Throughout the start however, I noticed that Gerard Way referred to the crowd as ""Manchester"" instead of ""Warrington"". 

The first time he said this I didn't think much of it; he's american and afaik Warrington isn't a well known town or anything, so it's an understandable slip up. He said it a couple of other times too, and this is where I think I was rude. 

After they played Black Parade I was quite riled up, giddy and overexcited. He then called us ""Manchester"" again, and I impulsively shouted at the top of my lungs ""WARRINGTOONNN"" 2 or 3 times. This was in a large and loud crowd, I thought it would be less than a drop in the ocean of sound. 

But then the rest of the crowd started shouting ""Warrington"" too, which made the band notice the mistake. He made a joke about it (""where is Warrington anyways?""), corrected himself and the concert continued. 

My friends and partner think I'm the one who started the crowd off, but I personally think most others had caught on to the mistake and would've said something anyways, regardless of me ""starting"" it. My friends think it's hilarious and have no issues with this, but my partner says that it's heclking, and that it's a rude thing to do at a concert. (They're not mad or anything, they just thought it was rude and it gave them second-hand embarrasment as a result) 

However, the band was referring to the crowd as a different city than the one they were really in, and nobody corrected them until the crowd did. Even if they didn't know any better, it's kinda rude on their part imo (like when you've been calling someone the wrong name for months without knowing). 

My main question is: Aita for correcting the band while they're on stage? Was it a rude thing to do on my part? I don't go to concerts very often, and I'm not familiar with the etiquette. I didn't even know the proper definition of the word ""heckling"" in the context of a concert until this (I used to think it only meant ""shouting at someone to provoke them to fight"" or something).",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4826494,public,top,self,AITA for heckling at a My Chemical Romance concert?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z565bn/aita_for_heckling_at_a_my_chemical_romance_concert/,all_ads,6,

As some background 1, 24f have been with my current partner 24m for about 5 years. We met in high school and have lived together for about 4 years and currently have 2 dogs together. I am quite extroverted and constantly like picking up and dropping hobbies in typical ADHD fashion as well as have a healthy social life and like to spend a large amount of time volunteering. My partner is quite the opposite, and unless I ask him to do something with me (which he usually is quite happy to agree to do) spends almost all his time playing video games in front of the computer. I try to take part in his hobbies (playing the off video game, ask questions about what he's playing- buy him computer equipment etc) but it's never recuperated. He's never invited me in on an activity or suggested to do something a weekend- and not that it matters so much but doesn't have a lot of interest in being
'healthy' (exercise, food health etc) and a lot of what I ask comes off as a favor (think ""hey babe, can you shave? We're meeting my parents for dinner"") and a lot of family situations are very forced and he complains about it almost nonstop.
Especially as Covid went down I find the gap between us has grown a lot, and I feel terrible saying it, but I'm not sure if the amount of effort he puts towards life in general or our relationship is enough. He has no friends, hobbies outside his computer and almost never sees any 'projects' through till the end. I tried talking to him about it, and he said I was being controlling by asking him to try and put in effort to having the same interests for
'conversation' and fixated on a comment I made about putting in effort to how he dressed styled his hair (which initially was made because I was saying I wish we could look at things in a shop and talk about them rather than me dragging him around the store while he asked to leave.) The conversation ended with him saying ""fine, I'll give up doing the thing that I do to relax in my very little time "" (which I found odd? Even during the workday when he works from home I often walk in and find him playing games whole code is running or he's between meetings) "" just so I can make better conversation with you."" I'm quite close to his family, and partly because of the amount of time we've been in a relationship it's hard to give up on it.

Some context: my ex and I have had a tumultuous relationship to say the least. There was a lot of unnecessary back and forth and the cycle has been really difficult to break out of because whenever I leave, my ex tends to reach out out of the blue. I stupidly always take him back out of loneliness but back to my main point. 

My best friend of many years has watched this happen. Now, I don’t fault him at all for having an opinion on the matter but with my anxiety mounting day by day, I finally reached a breaking point with him. I was spending time with my ex and I got a rather petty text from my best friend asking me if I thought he was stupid, the implication being that I’m hiding my ex from him. For one thing, it felt really condescending and I technically don’t owe anyone information because I’m a grown adult and this is my life. 

One of my other best friends literally paused their twitch stream to notify me that my bestie had sent them a letter on Animal Crossing New Horizons to notify them that I was back with my ex. They know my friend streams on twitch and they used my real name so there’s a good chance my personal business was aired out to my other best friend’s twitch audience. They also messaged a bunch of our mutual friends who then started messaging me to tell me I was making a mistake which made me feel embarrassed and alienated. For what it’s worth, the friend on twitch thought the letter was a violation of my privacy and I’m glad they told me right away what was going on. 

After months of no contact, he decided to message me a very triggering “he’s (my ex) going to turn out exactly like your father”. My best friend knows firsthand the abuse I’ve faced at the hands of my father and I think he’s gone a step too far. Reading that message not only spiked my anxiety but made me sad because after months of no contact he didn’t think to ask how I was or apologize for his approach months prior.

I feel hurt and confused because I understand he cares for me but I feel he’s overstepping my boundaries and talking down to me in a really triggering way. At this point what I need from my friends is support and if they’re unable to provide it I prefer silence. 

I’m also worried I’m in the wrong for ignoring someone who cares about me and being oversensitive about the situation. I also feel at fault for spending most of our friendship never clearly defining my boundaries because I have a hard time standing up for myself. 

I know eventually this needs to be addressed with a conversation but I really want him to apologize for his behaviour towards me and thus far there’s no signs of that happening any time soon.

I didn’t mind at first because my parents would pay me for looking after my brother, but they slowly started to stop. When my sister (23) got her first dog i started having to look after him as well while she was at work (she still lives at home btw) and i knew she didn’t plan on paying me.

I i started to get annoyed that i was no longer getting paid for looking after my brother because it was the only way i could get money (i can’t get a job because of college + then i have to look after my brother and the dogs) and i’ve been asking for jobs around the house that i could do for money. My dad gives my brother jobs all the time and pays him for them and they said they’d do the same with me but they haven’t.

Now i should mention that because i have to look after them i can almost never go out with my friends. My sister on the other hand goes out all the time and she is never asked to look after them instead of me. I’m never actually asked, i’m just told i have to. I also always have to wake up super early to come down and look after the dogs, my brother would still be in bed so at least i get a break from looking after him too.

I tried talking to my mom about this a while ago and she got mad and told me that i don’t need to be paid, my sister was in the room too and she said “why do you need to be paid? you don’t go out anyway.”

Since then my sister has gotten another dog (yes, we all wanted him but my sister will only say he’s ours if he has an accident and she doesn’t want to clean it up, other than that she says he is her dog) and i was thinking about being asked to be paid again since it’s a lot more stressful now, but the way they reacted last time made me feel like an ass.

Yesterday I went to a nail salon to get a new set done. I got medium nude oval nails: not extremely long, but just not my normal length. After I came back home, my bf saw them and stopped talking to me, saying he dislikes it so much and doesn’t want to be judgy so he‘d rather not say anything. I was fine with it, cause he has ADHD and change is hard for him, so I decided to wait a bit. But know it’s getting out of hand. It’s been around 24h now, and he doesn’t speak to me, doesn’t look at me, doesn’t hug (i tried hugging at night and he didn’t hug me back, just laid there visibly uncomfortable). 

I tried to speak to him in the morning, saying I don’t get the situation and want clarity, since I feel distanced and lonely and pushed away. He said, that is exactly what is happening, because my hands we perfectly aesthetic to him before (short, usually dark red nails) and now my whole appearance and I am in generally are ruined for him. And also he said, I knew he disliked this style, so I should have known better. 

-&gt; I spoke to my friends, sister, mom and a very critical dad, if it was ok. All of them said it look good on me and really suits me. Again: I expected my critical dad to say, I look like a whore for having this style, but he said it’s really nice and elegant. 

-&gt; The style I am talking about is “nude medium nails” if you want to look at it on Pinterest

I (24F) have been dating this guy (25M) for almost 5 years. I study in one city but every other weekend i go to my hometown, where my bf lives (2h-drive). (english not my 1st language, sorry for any mistakes)

My grandparent (father of my father) was in the hospital for the last couple of months. He passed away this Thursday. We were not very close to my dad's side of the family since they live about 3 hours from us. But nonetheless I felt sad for the whole situation and even more sad for my dad's loss.

When I heard the news i sent a message to my bf and he called me right away. He was being very supportive. He had a padel game with some friends that night which he called off immediately although I said it was not necessary since I wanted to spend the night with my family at home. That afternoon I drove to my homwetown along with my dad.

My parents left to the city where my grandfather used to live on Friday morning leaving me to take care of my sister (14F). They left me with a small list os chores I have to do (e.g. take my sister to dance classes, grocery shopping, re-arrange some doctor appointments).

My sister's dance classes started at 7PM and the school is a bit far from where we live, I asked my bf to drive us there (we only have 1 car and my parents took it). He was OK with leaving us there but he had John's bday dinner at 8PM so he couldn't leave us at my house after, since my sister's dance class only finish at 8:45PM. I was disappointed. In the previous day he cancelled the padel match without me asking for it and he said he would be there if i needed him. and when i needed him he was off to a friends party. In the end i asked a aunt of mine to get me and my sister and leave us at my house.

Today (Saturday) is my grandfather funeral day (which I will not be attending, since my mum said it wasnt necessary and i dont know how to deal with death). Me and my sister are staying in our house. I needed some groceries and was thinking about asking my bf but apparently he went to play football with his friends the whole morning and was not available to help me out. He invited me to go bowling with his friends this afternoon (""Ryan's"" bday) which I refused. He has already let me know that he wont be available this night since Ryan is having a dinner bday at his house and my bf wants to go.

I feel irritated and he knows i'm mad at him. He says i dont want his support just his rides. And i say that for me, his support is to help me out with my things since i dont have a car and depend on it.

Fast forward to November &amp; my dad decided we should move into a house - so I needed to pack up again. 2019 was the first time I canceled on her. Work &amp; moving along with panicking = not the vibe. I had seen her recently but she replied with just straight up spite &amp; judgment. She didn’t understand the anxiety aspect, &amp; didn’t understand how I could be too exhausted or stressed to come be with family. Mind you, even though I had seen her, we didn’t really have a relationship. I canceled &amp; stuck with it but I did go to Christmas that year. It was really awkward but then she finally said it was good I didn’t come because apparently there was some political fight at dinner on thanksgiving. I went for New Years as well but they were trying to keep me there for so long I ended up abruptly leaving after about 3.5 hours.

2021 she messaged me in the summer &amp; asked if I could come house sit (sleep at her house) for a week - I said no but I could come by to take care of her plants &amp; her cats every day. She sent me the longest hate message telling me to fuck off &amp; that she thought I’d be grateful to have a house to myself &amp; that I never do her any favors. I didn’t reply. I canceled on her again for the holidays later that year. She was pissed again. Later she posts on Facebook that she’s so sad a “family member” is now estranged from her &amp; in the same breath says oh &amp; I’m engaged look at my ring

2022 - I call her in the summer and say I wish we had a better relationship &amp; I wish we could talk more over the phone to develop a relationship instead of making me feel like I have to come out to dinners &amp; be awkward. She sounded like she understood. I let her know I understood her frustrations too &amp; I apologized for my own anxiety and issues… even though I’m doing all I can to fix them. She doesn’t call or text me again until the week before thanksgiving. So I cancel again because it’s my busy season at work &amp; I didn’t feel like going.

I needed some groceries and was thinking about asking my bf but apparently he went to play football with his friends the whole morning and was not available to help me out. He invited me to go bowling with his friends this afternoon (Ryan's bday) which I refused. He has already let me know that he wont be available this night since Ryan is having a dinner bday at his house and my bf wants to go.

I feel irritated and he knows i'm mad at him. He says i dont want his support just his rides. And i say that for me, his support is to help me out with my things since i dont have a car and depend on it.  


AITA for needing different support than the one my bf is offering?

I am happy and grateful; they are generally kind people and were clear about the fact no one should spend Christmas alone.

Fast forward.... I am not big on presents. I find it stressful - like you get this friend something, so it'd be weird not to get this friend something, etc. I have a big family and a large friend group, so it's difficult.

 Every year I spend the money on the Angel Tree Program. I like the idea of fulfilling a specific child's wish/need list. My friends and their kids have everything they need; I'd rather spend my money on a kid asking Santa for a coat and socks.

For the record, I am clear about this every year and put it out that I don't want anyone buying me anything. 

Well, the family I'm spending Christmas mentions they got me something. Now I feel obligated to get them something, so I ask each member of the couple what to get the other. The gift ideas are $100+. I explain to the husband that it's a little out of my budget and I'm doing the Angel Tree, so most of my money is going that way (I'm not struggling but they're more financially well-off than I am). 

He gets all uppity with me because he doesn't support the Salvation Army (which I understand, but I am not letting that detract from me fulfilling kids' wishlists) and informs me that they have spent that much on me. 

And now it escalates.... They asked what I got their kid. I said nothing. If I get their kid something, I have to get each kid in the friend group something and there are about 6 of them. Can't get one kid something and not the others, but buying for 6 kids will be tough. It's a tight-knit group of couples and the kids all spend time together. 


Apparently I was the only one going and they've already put in an order for food (fancy prime rib dinner). Now I'll never go to someone's place for a holiday and not bring something. But I'm not spending a bucket load of cash on a specific item when I can make something that is cheap, but tasty and of quality. I just don't want to ask what I should bring and have it be something ridiculous. I did that once with them and they wanted this baked bean recipe but it had something 30 ingredients, it was going to cost me almost $60. For baked beans!

I'm frustrated because I do have to budget and I feel like my friends don't understand that. I also hate that they're using my desire to be charitable as a staging point for their fight against an organization they don't like. It's not like I need a round of applause over it, I just don't think I deserve to be shamed for it. 

So, I told them I'm not coming to Christmas and to return whatever they bought me. I don't know where I'm going for Christmas, but at this point I don't care if I spend it alone. I'm also considering just ending the friendship.

Please bare with me. I am new on here and this might be a long one. 

My husband (m30) and I (f37) have been married for 6 years. We have a son together and I brought a second one into the relationship. 

My husband has some social deficits. It didn’t strike me as odd  that the contact to his family is sporadic and mostly comes from his siblings site. 

I am the opposite. My family is closely knit, not a day passes without my mother and my siblings talking. 

Naturally I got tossed into the position to manage our social calendar and also became the number one point of contact for his family. I would make an effort to keep in touch to better the relationships…and I shall never ever, not in a million years do that again. 

His parents got divorced while he was in his late 20s. Mom just simply wanted to find herself (which is fine, but I doubt you find yourself at the bottom of a bottle of wodka) despite all the efforts from Doctors, she kept to her ways and died a few days after my son was born. 

I had a difficult pregnancy and I could not walk anymore the last three months of it. On top of that we had just moved. During this time his mother would show up randomly at our new house, one time being picked up by strangers because she was sitting besides the road in a pond  screaming for help. She was drenched wet and dirty, stripped naked and went for my shower. My husband was not home and I was freaking out. 

When his mom was released into hospice care my son was 2 days old. It was demanded that my husband would sleep at his mothers. But I just had a cesarean section and my husband didn’t want to leave me alone. 
He received the following message from his sibling: “I hope your wife and your child die a horrible death” (Forgive and forget they say right? Well, I forgave but I can never forget that)

His other Sibling took my car as “I was not able to drive anyway” and then did not want to return the car. 

We went with his whole family on a family vacation. Their Stepmother threw a tantrum.

We went on vacation with one of his siblings and their Partner for 3 weeks. After 2 days sibling + partner got into a massive fight and started throwing the inventory around. For the rest of the three week vacation there was a horrible atmosphere in the house. 

For the sake of length let’s sum up some other things:

- one of them stole a large sum of money from their employer and somehow it was employers fault because they were too rich.

- on an occasion a Hamster got tossed out of a window

- when I had a miscarriage I was asked to: not bother anyone with it. 

- none of them has ever shown any genuine interest in my family or me. 

And while I remain polite and friendly with them (we live in the same town) I have withdrawn myself from any communication with them. 

And now somehow my husbands father wants us all to have family Therapie. 
There is 0 interest in me for that.

So what happened was, years ago when Milly was about 3, my sister/her mom, Laila (38) left to work in another country, leaving Milly in my(44M) care. Milly's father died before she was born. Laila had promised to send money for me to take care of Milly and that'd she'd call and visit as often as she could until she could take Milly to live with her permanently.

After she left, she called probably 3 times in the first two months and then went awol. For years I'd tried to find out what happened and assumed the worst, only to hear from one of her friends a couple of years later that she got married to someone else and has an entire new family. I was heartbroken because Milly would ask when her mom was coming back and I never knew what to say except ""soon"". But even she grew tired of it and realized when she was about 8 that her mom wasn't coming back anytime soon, that's if she was coming back at all. Because of this situation, me and my wife were granted parental rights to Milly and she couldn't have been happier that we were officially her parents. 

Well, what do you know, after 11 years, Laila finally graced us with her long overdue return last week, along with her new very wealthy family and 2 children. Most of the family was happy with her return but me, my mom, dad, and my wife were nothing short of furious. She tried to explain but all that we heard was "" I abandoned my own daughter and made a new family"". 

As if that wasn't enough, she practically demanded her daughter back. Mom and dad weren't having it at all and told her Milly belongs to me and my wife and that she no longer has any right to her. Welp, there she goes screaming at me about stealing her daughter because I was infertile and to hear that come out from her mouth hurt me in a way I've never been hurt before to the point where I cried and left. Me being infertile has always been my weak point and for her to casually bring it up like that despite being my sister broke me. For the next days, I prevented her from contacting Milly and I haven't told her that Laila is back because I'm scared I'll lose my daughter. I'm a human being too, I get attached, especially to someone I've had to raise, that too out of my own pocket, not that I'm complaining. I believe Milly is my daughter and I can't let her go back to the very same woman who abandoned her.

Two years ago Megan met a guy and had his baby (19m). Then they moved into a small apartment.

A few weeks ago Megan called me and asked if I could feed her 5 cats when she went away on vacation. I didn't have an issue with this. I lived close by so I agreed. She said she would be back in 2 weeks.


I went there on a Friday opened the door and OH MY GOD THE SMELL. There was trash everywhere rotting food on the counters, sink, and stove. There were food cans with sharp lids on the floor covered in mold. The bedroom had used condoms on the floor and trash all over. The baby's room has choking hazards everywhere. The bathroom has never been cleaned. The litter boxes had litter but the entire thing was one massive clump overflowing with poo. The living room had more trash and office supplies covering the floor along with a ton of open medication bottles on the coffee table. 

I called Megan. I asked what the heck was going on. She said it wasn't that bad and that I just needed to feed the cats and give them water. I told her that unless she let me clean up a bit she would need to find another person to feed her cats since I didn't feel safe there. She finally agreed since I was feeding the cats for free and didn't want to pay someone else to do it.

My partner and I got to work. The litter boxes needed to be replaced, and the cat food had bugs so we got new food. The kitchen took hours to deep clean and we found they didn't own trash bags, cleaning supplies, or even a broom.

Day 2 we did 10 loads of laundry. The used condoms and tissues were the worst for me. They were everywhere.

We put paperwork in a box for them to sort. Any coins and jewelry were put in a cup on the dresser.

Day 3 my partner and I did the bathroom armed with bleach. We bought them soap since they had none.

Day 4 in the baby's room we organized the toys and got rid of choking hazards like button batteries and chewed bouncy balls. All of the small stuff is put in a jar on the top shelf.

Day 5 in the living room, we made another 6 bags of trash. We collected all the medication, put it in a box, and put it in the kitchen on a high shelf.

Day 6 was maintenance. We vacuumed and mopped all the floors, and cleaned the counters and walls. I sent Megan pictures of the progress every day along with where I was putting everything important.

Megan came to my house today livid. I made her look bad in front of her fiance because ""if a fat woman can clean why couldn't she"". She was also angry that I threw away her husband's ""collection"" 🤮. She called the police and told them we stole a ton of jewelry and clothes. Their cameras inside showed none of that only our cleaning.

She ended up 'shooting herself in the foot' when she called the police since they saw how it looked before on video so CPS was called

A few weeks ago her and I met up with my friend Phil for drinks. I was tired and left early but Jen and Phil stayed out for quite a bit.

After this he added her on Instagram, which is no big deal. But he started to text her, asking her to go out party (according to him in a platonic way). I know Jen’s not interested either way. But then he’s kept on texting her now and then. 

They met again when I had a get together a few days ago, and he keeps on texting her, more than he even texts me.

I have no romantic feelings for him (or her) but I just feel so uncomfortable that he texts someone he met twice, that’s married and showed him no interest.

I, F34 have a 3 year old kid. This year, my partner M35 has taken two (cheap) one week solitary surf vacations (for his mental health), and one solitary five week trip to his home country for his spiritual practice. 

My gorgeous, but high energy kid has just started school, so I have a few hours alone several days a week now, but I’m constantly exhausted, drowning in laundry/housework and desperate to sleep, whilst I’m also setting up a company and reviving my career. 

He pays the rent, while I pay kindergarten fees and groceries (which almost equal out). I’ve gone into debt paying my share of our bills, while he works two jobs to support us. 

I love being mom, but I really need a break too. He said, “You already have days off since kid started school”. And, when I have my period, I’m asking that he can go to bed at midnight instead of 3am, so I can have one morning off. It's one day per month.

He’s not open to having therapy together, and I’ve been waiting and hoping things would change for years now.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4826474,public,top,self,AITA For Wanting A Break Too?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z55qhk/aita_for_wanting_a_break_too/,all_ads,6,

She used me for money a lot growing up and I never took her off my joint bank account because I felt guilty that I was living at her house and not formally paying rent, so she dipped into my account a lot.

One day I decided to cut her off, and my mom went ballistic and told me I was evil and threatening the other kids (my younger siblings who are also adults, which is  not true), and literally went to the court and got a restraining order against me just out of spite and told my siblings to do so too.

When the hearing came, NONE of them showed up because again, the ""restraining order"" was only done out spite.

My mom was mad that I wanted to control my own money and also wouldn't let me watch TV and we got into a big fight and she took my phone. I went nuts because this is my phone that I PAID for, and she then sent me to a psych ward where I was locked up for days.

My mom then kicked me out and left me homeless, even though I offered to pay a little rent. I literally had no where to go for 2 years, and rented a room out of some lady's house.

Then my grandma died and my mom said I could stay there and is buttering me up with cheap earrings and stuff, but I'm still mad at her so I don't want to get her anything for Christmas. Problem is she treats my siblings great so they are getting her expensive presents and they BOTH still live at my childhood home (rent free) and get her nothing the rest of the year.

Because there were many students there and I still couldn't remember all of them, I used my red pen and wrote on his paper how many points he lost.
After a few days I looked at the exam papers and graded them. After I went through his paper, I noticed empty blank space that was completely scribbled. I inspected a bit closer and could notice red color (from my pen) and ""footprint"" of a number there. It was his paper, and he tried to hide that I subtracted his points.
During the class, I confronted him and told him that not only were his points subtracted, but that he also won't ever be able to repeat the midterm exam again

His parents are pretty strict so as far as they're concerned we've only been dating for about a year.

My family has known about him and my relationship and have always welcomed him and treated him like their own, offering him support, help and comfort whenever he needs it. I have not been shown the same openness from his family and I do my best to not take it personaly but this time, it really got to me. I am usually excluded from his family plans (although he is never excluded from ours) but this time, when his mother decided to plan a date with my boyfriend to go to the movies, she extended the invite to me too. I happily accepted and was excited to be shown a little welcoming from his mother who I've picked up on a little jealousy and boundary crossing on multiple occasions. The movie was planned for the next day and when I texted my boyfriend asking when I should be ready he told me there was a change of plans regarding his sisters plans with friends that had fallen through and they would now be giving my ticket to the sister instead. I understand this isn't a big deal, but the movie was a big stepping stone for me and I know that if it were my family, my boyfriend would not have been treated like an expendable second priority.

I would have at least liked an apology or to have been asked if I was okay giving my ticket to his sister which I would have had no problem doing.

This is a doozy.

I (20F) am in college. The school year has ended and I'm on my December staycation and the schools won't be open until February.

Ever since the holidays started, my dad would either shame me for sleeping late or incessantly keep trying to wake me up (while my mom would silently judge me with an expression on her face that used to give me nightmares). I figured if ignored him he would go away and just let me sleep. He never does. 

I've worked so hard throughout the year. I've been through depression, fights that made me feel physically unsafe in my own home, to the point of wanting to escape from it (I even packed a bag and called child services. they still don't know), fatshaming (by them), my mom taking away my phone repeatedly and the worst part, I can still never tell my parents about anything going on in my life, because we would either fight about it, they would say it's no big deal or they would tell me to focus on my school work. I finally discovered the free therapy that the school provides (THANK GOD). 

Now after all that, I think it goes without saying that I deserve to sleep without anyone trying to wake me up. I am someone who (when I have the time) can sleep until 3 pm and still be able to fall asleep at 1 am. I know that's drastic and I wouldn't be doing that if I was still busy with my school work, but I'm not. My parents and I have gotten into a lot of fights about my sleeping habits and every year it's the same problem. The other day I told my dad that I'm on holiday and if I want to sleep until late afternoon you'd best believe I will. And that when he's on holiday, he'll be able to do the same. He seemed pretty satisfied with that answer so I thought he'd leave it at that. 

Yesterday (Friday) afternoon I was taking a nap on the couch at 11am (mind you, I had woken up at 5 am due to thunder). Between 12 and 2pm my dad kept trying to wake me up. He was sitting right next to me and would suddenly say a word or phrase loudly to wake me up. Now I'm not talking about a normal tone of speech. Obnoxious is the best way to describe it. One time when he woke me up (I thought it had been the 4th time), I told him to stop and he said he hadn't done anything. I figured I must have dreamt it, but he did it at least 5 times after that. We ended up fighting and I ended up going to my room, because I couldn't deal with him any more. Now this morning he did it again. He was standing at the open window behind my bed and kept same obnoxious way for what felt like forever. Then he'd go away, come back and do it again. 

Eventually he came into my room, sat on my bed and started shaking my arm. I slapped it away and kept saying my name again. Then I pulled the covers over my head and he kept doing it. Then I kicked him. I didn't want to do it but he was being so incessant When I whimpered telling him to leave me alone, he finally left.

I freaked out. I'm the daughter of an addict, so I immediately felt like I was being accused. My friend broke an arm so is on some heavy stuff, and I assumed that was what she was talking about. 

Note: I don't do drugs that aren't prescribed to me. I used to smoke pot, but I have a psychiatric condition, where I can't even drink wine, so smoking pot or taking any pills is out of the question. Due to my bipolar meds. I am in a depressive episode now, so I tend to get a bit sensitive. 

I also hate pain meds. I have autoimmune arthritis and have had to be on them before and they make me feel horrible. When I was young and couldn't walk, my mother actually stole my pain meds. So trauma + depressive episode + lack of tone in a text = me having a mild panic attack and getting defensive. 

My friend found her meds right next to her bed. She said that I was unhelpful and made it about me. I informed her that the expression she used is one that usually is said when one person is suggesting someone stole something. 

She said she was afraid my kids got in her room (she's been in her room all day, so that didn't happen, and she knows it. Also my kids were gone with family all day). 

I just told her how I felt about people taking others meds (I take it very seriously), and I said she didn't have to worry about that with me. I told her I'm glad she found them. She said I'm a jerk for always making everything about me. I'm honestly confused by that, since I'm fairly kind, and care. I'm just having a hard time in life right now.

Ok so, a bit of backstory.

Me (F18) and my friend (F19), we’ll call her L, are pretty close to each other. She always invites me to hang out with her and to go to the weekly tips with her and her family, and of course i try to do the same with her. I love her deeply (platonically) and in no way i’ve ever meant to hurt.

She has a younger brother (M17), we’ll call him F, whom im sort of friends with, though i pretty much see him only when i meet with L, but in general we get along fine. He has hyperactivity, and he always want to do exciting things/trips, but most of the times L declines because she doesn’t really like those things + her and F aren’t really fond of each other lol but anyway. i like the thrill of adventure, so one day after he asked once again to go to a place i said yes. I kinda fancy him, cause if we’re being honest, he’a hot af: he’s won the national gym championship, just imagine how fit his body is 😮‍💨. L knows about this lil crush of mine and she never had a problem with it, she even tried to set me up with im in different occasions lol.

basically, after i said yes, i realize i didnt want to be alone with him (im kind of shy and i’ve never actually been alone with him and that made me kinda anxious), because after all we werent close. I spoke about this to L and asked is she was willing to come with me, she could have just waited until we finished with the activity (she could watch for example). at first she said she’ll think about it and after a couple of days she said yes, but she would have brought another frind of ours (A) to keep her company. I thought thay was reasonable so i just thanked her for coming with me. then two days later she told she wouldn’t come anymore and i was confused but i assumed that sixne she didnt like the activity she thought she would have gotten bored so i didnt make a fuss of it. but then again the next day she changd her mind once again and decid she would come.

But, th evening of the day before the “date”, at 11pm, L and A cancelled and told they didnt want to come anymore. I became anxious and asked her why were they saying this and they told me they just didnt feel like it anymore. Then i got mad. We started arguing over text and i told her that she should have just told me no in the beginning and i would have accepted it as an answer. i told her i didnt feel comfortable going anymore. and after that, she started guilt-tripping me with things like “you should feel horrible, now my brothr is disappointed because you cancelld and he was so excited about tomorrow”.

and thay hurt me. i felt shitty for days and of course i apologized more than once to F (tho i dont expect him to forgive me right away and that’s ok), but i kinda expected an apology from her. or at least a tentative of reconciliation. nothing. until i textd her a week later. im still hurt, but i dont think she’ll ever apologize.

should i just suck it up?

While we were living together I started noticing how stingey he would be with expenses. Sometimes I wouldn't be able to pay for dinner or pay for groceries so he would pay but he would put it on this app called SplitWise that tracks the money you owe someone or that they owe you. This started to put heaps of pressure on me so I would try my best to live off the small amount the government was giving me. We would go to the store and he would buy himself this really expensive ice-cream and he would suggest I get the cheap one. 

To cut the story short, I often walk around with a barred phone because I can't pay my bills. My car battery is dying and I often can't start my car. My partner knows all of this is going on and he never even offers to help out. I am having to go to my parents for money which they don't have a lot of in the first place. To put it into perspective my partner has a very well paying job and in his junior years he is earning 90k a year and that number goes up significantly every year. Any money I do ask for he puts on SplitWise which puts so much pressure on me. I feel like we aren't a unit and that we are living separate lives even though we are going to be married soon and are trying to save for the same things. My parents keep telling me its almost a form of financial abuse but I'm not sure. Its hard to include all the ways it hurts me and puts pressure on our relationship but I'll put the basics up for your opinions.

TW: eating disorders, anorexia.

WIBTA?

My (27f) niece (16), N, is very unwell with an eating disorder (anorexia). She’s been sick for 3 years, but it got REALLY BAD after she got Covid in February and the symptoms she got from Covid were diahrrea and stomach pain.

During that illness she went from 90lbs (about 20lbs underweight) to 77lbs.
Since then we’ve been in a holding pattern: she’s home for 3-4 weeks until her stats (blood sugar, temperature, heart rate) are bad enough for admission. Then she’s in hospital for 2 weeks. Rinse, repeat.

I am the late baby from my generation - N’s dad (my brother) is 30 years older than me, so N &amp; I have always been the two babies of the family and very close. My brother passed away when N was 10. N’s mother (52F) L is a single mom but is also *really* wealthy (she’s a CEO on multi millions a year). My sister A (59F) is the other family member in the area. The rest are in other states or countries. Other than L, the rest of us are lower middle class.

In N’s most recent admission to hospital she will only eat if family members come to watch her. According to the staff, when she’s in the group setting (with other anorexia patients) she is the ring leader of not eating and will bully patients who do eat by calling them fat etc. If you don’t eat anything you need to drink a nutrient shake &amp; you also get another one put through a feeding tube, and if you eat part of the meal you get a nutrient shake but no tube feed, so not eating means double the calories of eating. If you eat, you don’t get the extra calories from the drink. Just the food. In order to be discharged you need to be medically stable and eat all your meals for 48 hours, no nutrient drink.

My husband (28M) K and I have a child (1.5f) and I’m pregnant. N &amp; L have asked all the family to go in and supervise her meals. Me, K &amp; A all work full time, and me and K have our daughter to manage as well. We are getting asked to go in to supervise meals 2-3 times a week. 

N is mean(which is part of the disease, and also common for 16 year olds) and the visits are really really unpleasant, and we have run down our paid leave to go sit with N, as well as K &amp; I often missing dinners or bedtimes with our daughter. Plus the hospital parking is really expensive.

I don’t think we’re helping by supervising her meals. Drs have advised that it’s her tactic to gain as little weight as possible to get discharged and save face in front of the other patients, and it’s better that she eat with the group. But L wants to make N happy because when L does what N wants N is nicer to her, while normally she’s downright cruel to her mom.

A, K &amp; I have been talking and want to tell L we won’t do it anymore, and will only visit once a week on a weekend and not at meal times. But we also feel like that leaves L with no support at all, and we don’t want N to feel unloved or unwanted, we just don’t want to help her subvert treatment. 😢",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4826414,public,top,self,WIBTA for not watching my niece eat?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z550oi/wibta_for_not_watching_my_niece_eat/,all_ads,6,

I introduced him to my new friend (F) which I absolutely adore. The three of us started hanging out together and we soon found out that the new friend, let's call her Jenna, is a big people pleaser.

Basically over the few months, Jeff had hurt me pretty badly with some comments so I kept my distance from him. Jenna defended him how he probably did not mean it but it was clear as day that he did. Nonetheless, she comforted me when I got anxious because of it.

The two of them soon got into a relationship which baffled me since he also had a few bad comment about her but I knew she was gonna accept the relationship because she never says no. So a few days ago we went for a coffee after failing our exams, and he noticed she wasn't wearing a bra and though it was good to inappropriately touch her. She looked uncomfortable as hell and I was ready to throw hands but she said it was fine and that she's used to it.

So we sit down and they start making out in public, in front of me, even though she promised I would never be the third wheel. So she apologised and Jeff looked baffled as to why she would promise such a thing. So I tell him it isn't really ideal to suck face in public and he got offended.

So I told my husband that after dinner I would like for everyone to stay at our place to chat and have drinks, instead of going to thé bar like the boys usually do.

My husband and his friends (my friends’ husbands) showed up already a bit drunk at our place at 8pm. By this time, the baby was put to bed, I cooked dinner, and baked my own cake.

Dinner went well, everyone was happy. After the cake and présents, things were a bit quiet. As I was proposing boardgames, my husband asked the boys to go back to the bar. 
Everyone was on board, even the girls, as they all live in town they said that after the drink they’ll go home. 

I asked my husband if I could co and he stays home with the baby. But he says it woul be weird.

My family owns an Old English Sheepdog (3) and a cat (7). They never really got along, but they can live with the thought of one another being in the house. 
We also really like to travel abroad, we are European, and we weren't really outside Europe yet (only Egypt, Turkey, and the UAE) but we have lots of plans. 
Whenever we travel (don't think about big stuff, the maximum of days that we left for is 10 so far) either my dad (my parents separated a while ago) my uncle, or occassionally my step-dad (but it's only when we go for an all girls trip) is in the duty of looking out for our dog. They hadn't had problems with it, because we all love him. 

Some things about our dog. He is like a giant baby. He's 88 lbs and so big that you don't even have to bend down to pet him. He jumps up at people and is very playful. He honestly gets along with everyone, except my cat. 

My mom has gotten into doing charity work for dog shelters a while ago. One time I even went with her to bring food and blankets to a shelter nearby. I usually don't look into these stuff because I'm a very sensitive person and this would break me way too easily. 
Ever since my mom started donating to these shelters, sometimes she said that she considered bringing home another dog. Me and my stepdad just shrugged it off, because we both know that she loves traveling, and with another dog, it wouldn't be possible. 

But now, I guess one of my nightmares is coming true. 
Mom found a dog shelter, which specifies in british breed dogs. That specific dog (9mo) is the same breed as ours. 
A while ago, she said that she'd be willing to give up her dreams if it meant saving a dog. And now that dog is the same breed as ours, she's head over heels. 
(This breed is special to her, because her childhood dog was also an old english, and they are her all time favorite.) 

If everything she said is true, the new dog is coming today. These news hadn't caught me in a very good moment because I had just gotten out of hospital a day ago (oral surgery) and I'm still not in my best physical state. 
Mom asked me if I was happy about the new dog, and I - with noble simplicity - told her I wasn't. 
Call me selfish all you want, but if we get a new dog, we won't be able to travel.
Traveling has been a part of my life since day 1, and taking that away is like ripping a great piece out of who I am. 
(Sadly, me traveling alone, with friends or with my father is not an option.)
I guess to her, giving up on her dreams also means ruining her daughter's life.
I'm young, I want to see the world, and now it won't be possible. 
Regardless of the fact that she didn't ask mine or my stepdad's opinion on this whole situation, it still hurts.

If she ever find her daughter then we'll have a whole new person in the family, split inheritance etc... I am perfectly happy the way our family is.

My mother has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease this summer. She told us "" My last wish to find my baby"". I am freaking offended , so we aren't good enough for her. She abandoned her baby herself, why do we have to pay the price of her poor decisions. It is a baby she held for few hours more than 50 years ago.

They agreed, however they told my other parent to put them in water and put it up on a shelf that my cats can’t get to. 

I have been paranoid about it ever since. My cat has a lot of hair balls and throws up every so often (sometimes it a few times a week, or sometimes it’s every day) but we’ve been to a vet and the vet said there’s nothing to worry about. However, today my cat was sick twice. She hasn’t had any of the other symptoms of lily poisoning, just throwing up hair balls. I’m pretty sure it’s not to do with the lilies as she literally cannot and hasn’t ever jumped up onto the shelf it’s on, but I’m still anxious.

I was like „I‘m sorry? What?“ and she repeated her phrase. I kindly explained my reasons why i sat there and she was like: „When i was your age there were no such things as disabilities in your age“ „Well okay but i am?“ she literally kept going on about how i cant be disabled in the rudest way possible even called me names, saying how disrespectful i am while she was the one declining seatoffers of other people and being rude to me.

They always more than provided for me in terms of a house and things and education. But there was emotional abuse and I was always scared to get in trouble or rock the boat in anyway. 

I live in another country to them (they are US) and have done since I graduated. 

Since I dont know when, my father has invested money regularly into stock and retirement accounts in my name. He chose the accounts, has access to them, handles everything to do with them. But they are in my name. I have never touched a penny in these accounts or asked for him to put money in them, ever.  

As an expat I'm expected to file US taxes. My father has always volunteered to do this. I do all my own finances, pay my own bills, etc in my home country.

There has been an issue with my last tax return he did. They are claiming I owe a large amount of taxes which I couldn't pay from my own money in my county. He says it's a mistake and sent over a power of attorney for me to sign so he could speak to the IRS on my behalf. In trying to get this done there's been a weeks delay until I can get into work to print the form. I have 2 very young children and my husband and I both work. We're very tired and busy all the time. My father sent what to me felt like a very patronisng message mansplaining that printer services exist as 'something to consider'.  I lost my rag and replied that I was aware but my life is very busy. I don't appreciate the patronisng message of 'things to consider'. 1 week is the best I can do (that was still a month before the deadline).

My father got very upset. Told me he's tired of my verbal abuse. That it was a mistake for him to take over doing my taxes all these years and that I need to prioritse what he called 'my issue ' and not 'his issue'. 

I then let lose on my feeling in a message which I tried to keep factual and adult (but may not have succeeded). It's only 'my issue' because he's been using my name on these accounts all these years. That it's my money in name only. I've never been involved in a single decision to do with it. His expectation is that I learn the financial system of the US so he can continue as he has been. I told him if the purpose was to help me the money would be invested in my home country in accounts I understand and control. To add I have never had any debt issues of any kind. We have good finances and no debt so it's not a fear of me misusing funds. 

I gave 2 options for handling the situation. I can send him the power of attorney or I will pay the bill from one of these accounts in my name. Then after it's dealt with either he moves all the money to accounts not in my name or I move it permanently to my home country - his choice. I do not expect to have this money and said that. It's his to do with as he wants  but no longer in my name.

I really struggle standing up to my parents. I keep second guessing if I'm in the wrong here.

He also had some problems with using marijauna. Most kids do use some weed, but it caused him to have psychotic episodes. He went to rehab and is clean now.

His father and stepmum treated him quite badly, in general though  He is staying with me for this school year and will transfer back to live with my sister, his mum next year. Despite his past challenges, he is now doing very well.

Two weeks ago we were at a mall getting ice creams and a random guy (M, mid 40's) started talking to us. We realized he is from our home town and have the same religious and cultural background. He asked for both our numbers and my nephew and I said we would be open to a meet up. I did notice that when he was telling us about himself, he  he stressed that he is a wealthy single man with a lot of ""disposable income."" 

He texted us both several times, following up on the meet up. However, I am currently very busy and suggested meeting up towards the end of the week. 

He then suggested meeting up with my nephew alone since I am the busy one. I told him I will check with my nephew. His request immediately raised red flags with me and  I called my sister and explained the situation.  After talking to her, I sent the guy a text saying: Hi, thanks for the invitation. I discussed it with my sister  (his mum) and we both are not comfortable leaving the child with a random male. I am sure you will understand. He responded ""cool"" and nothing else since. 

My sister said she trusts my instincts, and my mum says that we should immediately delete his numbers.  However, my friends are saying that I overreacted. AITA?

He makes me feel absolutely terrible when my friends  and I do Drug B, and I'm sure I make him feel the same about Drug A.

&amp;nbsp;

My partner has expressed varying levels of desire to quit Drug A since we've met, though he eventually goes back on his word and ends up using it often again.

&amp;nbsp;

None of my friends do Drug A, so I've never had to develop an opinion of it before meeting my boyfriend. But through dating him, I've realized that I, in fact, do not like it.

&amp;nbsp;

My partner feels similarly about Drug B that I do about Drug A. I do Drug B every now and then, when I'm out with friends, but not much at all outside of that. From conversations I've had with my partner, it appears he's had/witnessed some bad things with Drug B, and so my use of it is triggering to him.

&amp;nbsp;

I've told my partner that I'm 100% willing to quit Drug B if it makes him uncomfortable. After all, I only do it occasionally, and it's truly something I can do without. I don't need to be doing drugs anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

He, however, isn't willing to make the same compromise on his end. Either he doesn't want to, or _can't_, give up Drug A, and this is very scary and disappointing to me. He's gotten to the point where he's said, ""You know what, do all the Drug B you want, because I don't want you telling me how I can use Drug A."" And that's where we've left off.

&amp;nbsp;

I love my partner to the end of the word, but his use of Drug A really annoys me and turns me off. I'm willing to stop the behavior that turns him off, so why can't he do the same for me?

Even though I worked Thanksgiving, i still hosted and cooked a small Thanksgiving celebration for my husband’s parents and us, plus my 2 kids who stopped over for a bit. 

My husband and I have had a lot of problems in our 3 years together, but thanks to marriage counseling things are looking up. One thing he has always done that really hurts my feelings is he acts like I’m not part of his family, and rarely includes me in his thoughts and plans regarding them. In fact, I didn’t even know I was hosting thanksgiving until 3 days prior, even though he had made these plans with them weeks before. I think he only told me before the day of because he realized there would be no god of he didn’t. He also neglected to tell me what time they arrive, so they came only an hour after I started cooking. 

Which brings me to the incident. My in laws were leaving and my husband walked them out while I put things away. I had a windows open, so I over heard a conversation between then where his parents invited us to Christmas with them where all the extended family would be together.  My husband replies “ sure, I would love to come!” No mention of me or asking me of I’d like to go or anything. I decided to wait for him to extend the invitation so I never said anything. And neither did he. So, feelings hurt and angered, I went to work today and signed up to make that extra money on Christmas too. I came home and told my husband and he got really upset and told me his family was expecting us on Christmas. I then told him I heard the conversation and I was never mentioned and since he never asked, I assumed he didn’t want me there. He told me that since were married we’re considered the same person when invited (???). Now his parents are upset with me too since it will be awkward for him to show up without me so he’s thinking about not going.
