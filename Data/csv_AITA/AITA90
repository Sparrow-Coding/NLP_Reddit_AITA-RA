Firstly, I want to say she’s only 19 years old and lives alone. She doesn’t have a good relationship with her family. These are the reasons why I will feel like TA if I do report her because it ruins her chance at keeping this job and could potentially make her lose her apartment.

I work retail. She started working in October through an outside company that only sells phones, plans and phone accessories at my work, meaning she’s not a employee of the company I work at.

When I first met her, she was very friendly and complimented me often. It wasn’t until a week after that she tried to embarrass me in front of my team for literally no reason at all. She said very loudly, “you’re brave for wearing that shirt to work showing cleavage”. I’m a C cup and barely even had any cleavage shown. I responded to her “there’s nothing wrong with what I’m wearing” and she said “well I guess if the company has an issue with it, they can pay for your breast reduction”. I had to walk away to not snap at her. 

Soon after this, I found out she was telling my coworkers and her boss that I was a whore behind my back. Her boss (doesn’t have firing power btw, the one above her does) and I aren’t close but we’re good enough friends that she told me and stuck up for me to her. The girl doesn’t know I know about this because I wanted to keep the peace and found it stupid and funny anyway that she’d try to spread that around like anyone would care. 

Around a month ago, I had a pregnancy scare from the last guy I saw. She overheard me telling her boss I bought a few tests and that they came back negative, but she again tried telling everyone behind my back that I was pregnant. 

Besides my personal issues with her, she is very unlikeable to my coworkers and customers. I’ve had so many customers complain to me and people on my team about her attitude and how obvious she’s unwilling to work. She often sits on her phone her entire shift.

When it comes to needing help with the phone stuff we can’t do ourselves, she gets annoyed and even angry at the customer sometimes for “inconveniencing” her. Anytime a cute guy around our age asks for help, for things that have nothing to do with phones, she takes over and tries to push me out, yet when literally anyone else needs help she forces them away.

She lost keys we lend to her for her shift to unlock phone shit and that alone set me off because she’s already annoying to be around to begin with.

Her attitude towards us and others only started improving like a week ago because she got talked to and was on the verge of getting fired. Because she’s in a tough spot right now I feel bad but I don’t want her around anymore. My entire team is sick of her as well as the boss and they all what me to collect all she’s done wrong and report her.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4826236,public,top,nsfw,WIBTA if I report this girl at work?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z52fse/wibta_if_i_report_this_girl_at_work/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,,

But at a party? Beethoven? Mozart? Bach? Debussy?.

Firstly, I wasn’t really enthusiastic to come to this party nor do I care to talk about moon landings. But my boyfriend (18m) asked me, so I didn’t want to abandon him in a pretentiously insufferable fuelled ambience. 

I usually stay at parties for an hour and a half max (maybe if they play “this is how we do it” I would stay for an extra 10 minutes), but that is pushing it. I arrived to this party in this rural location with my bf and I already felt like I was about to join in some type of ritualistic cult ridden thing.

Most of me and my boyfriend’s mutual were here so it wasn’t awkward, but, some classical enthusiast was in charge of the playlist. So, I still can’t get the image of people bussing down to Mozart out of my head.

After about an hour, I told my boyfriend I was leaving but he actually thought it had an exuberance atmosphere. I encouraged him to stay but he is tied to the hip with me as am I, so I took a cab home alone so he can drive back himself.

My boyfriend came back, told me that I “missed out” and he said it was a “dick move” to leave him as he would stay with me even if the building was on fire.

MIL said I don't get a second shower, she said it's called a sprinkle and it's just diapers/wipes, and it would be just the immediate family. 

My best friend still wants to throw a shower for me and I am so appreciative because I would love to have one but my family (in laws) seem annoyed about it. My best friend said she would handle everything but I guess because she initially asked them about co-planning they feel obligated to do something now. All I want to is feel that they are excited about another baby coming, because our first baby was so celebrated, I had multiple showers and people helping, I felt so supported and loved on during that time. I get the vibe they aren't excited, I'm not sure why, and it hurts my feelings. 

I am not close with my family, but I am close to my husband's family which is why my best friend contacted them about it. I have a good relationship with all of them, including my MIL. I have always helped and participated in baby (and wedding) showers for all the other women in the family. Including showers for two of my SILs second kids. We did have a sprinkle when they each had their third, but they both insisted they didn't need a shower because the kids were close in age to their siblings and they had everything they needed except for diapers and wipes. 

Surely they realize we don't have any of our baby stuff, because they have it. They haven't offered to give anything back (and I haven't asked because we gave it to them not expecting it back). I also don't know if they still have any of it, and even if they do, it's 6 years old and has gone through 3-4 kids at this point, I'm sure most of what might be left it is done for. Some of it we even gave to my MIL so she had things at her house for when all the grands were there. I'm not sure why a shower for our second is suddenly ""not what people usually do"" when we have done them for others in the family. My best friend said maybe they are burnt out on baby showers (this is #9 over 8 years, so maybe that is legitimately what is going on and it has nothing to do with me or my baby personally). I haven't noticed any sort of ""burn out"" before this though as his family clearly loves babies. 

I hate feeling like a burden or annoyance for wanting the same/similar experiences during this pregnancy as I did with the first. What is the normal protocol with baby showers?? What should I do?

For some context here we have been dating for 3 years nows and now that she graduated uni she’s coming to live with me and split rent. It’s a one bedroom apartment (has an extra room were she sleeps in and I sleep in the bedroom). We both like to sleep by ourselves, nothing wrong with the relationship, we just like our space sometimes. 

So this is going to sound really gross, but it’s just something I do. I keep a water bottle beside my bed (one of those big green Gatorade bottles athletes use, I use that bottle as it contains the smell I find as it so thick, and you can’t see in). Whenever I have to take a piss in the middle of the night I usually just piss in the water bottle and dump it the next morning.

This is something I’ve always done and since my girlfriend moved in, I guess she didn’t really know I did that as we sleep in different rooms most nights and I’ve just never crossed my mind to mention it. Anyways last night she fell asleep in my bed with me after watching Netflix and cuddling. 
I wake up in the morning to her hitting my shoulder gagging asking me what the fuck is in the bottle. I think you could imagine how this went

She is absolutely pissed off at me, she barely even looked at me today once she got off work.

Some more side information here. I have a severe nut allergy and have never ever shared food/drinks with her, it’s something we’re clear on as I get paranoid about that stuff, but apparently since it was one of those squirting gatorade bottles, she didn’t put her mouth on it and just squirted it in her mouth

Also, she sees it as a rejection because she feels I don't invest enough in the relationship. I see that as a reasonable argument.

I was a stupid 23 year old who got involved with a deadbeat with no prospects in life because I thought he was so charming. 2 kids later, 6 and 4 years old, and after coming to my senses courtesy of my family, i’m finally kicking him out of my life. He was a drain on me, never paid attention to the kids, and spent what little money he had on pot, porn, and video games, while I was the one busting my back to make ends meet.

The apartment is in my name and i gave my husband 2 weeks to pack his things and get out as our divorce proceeds.   

Anyways, our last argument was about the babysitter i hired a while back to look after my kids because complications at work meant I’d be at home less often on certain days. She’s a 17 year old girl I know from from our social circle and she’s amazing. She’s very responsible, trustworthy, mature for her age, and my kiddos love her. 

I recently enrolled my kids in swimming classes and Monday I asked the babysitter to take the kids to the apartment complex’s swimming pool for practice on certain days, Monday being the first day, with an increase in pay. I was going to be out of town for work related reasons that day, so she was gonna be with the kids the whole day. 

My babysitter asked me if she could wear a 2 piece bikini at the pool, since those are the only types of swimsuits she has. I told I didn’t have an issue with it because why would I?

The next day I was back and I had taken a day off from work to be with my kids. And that’s when I got an upset text from my babysitter. She told me that when she was bringing my kids back to the apartment, my husband, who was there because he needed to take out his computer, talked down onto her for wearing a bikini and displaying her belly piercing in front of the kids. I was livid when I read the text and I immediately called my husband.

I asked him if what the text said was true and I tore into him. He went on some bogus tangent saying he didn’t think it was appropriate for her to wear something that “skimpy” around the kids. I told him he needs to shut his mouth and keep his thoughts to himself. If I told the babysitter wearing her bikini was fine, there’s nothing else to it, considering he’s in the process of moving.

 He’s never cared for our kids and I didn’t mention, but 4yo approached me not once, but twice, about accidentally stumbling on daddy’s porn on her iPad, which I brought up to him. I don’t know if what I said got through to him, but he had no answer, and I finished the conversation by telling him to stay away from the babysitter and that he needs to keep his eye nose out of the kid’s upbringing. 

After that, I texted my babysitter, apologized, and said The situation was dealt with.

This ordeal starts with me and my friends planning out our annual friends Christmas about 2 months ago. Our group doesn’t get together as often as we would like but we make sure that we at least come to the friends Christmas. 

The day of the gathering comes, and my fiancé comes home from work visibly tired and stressed at around 3pm. She lays down on our bed and asks if she has to go tonight, and I say “no baby, you can stay home and relax, no pressure to come to the gathering” so she continues to fall asleep. I start getting ready to leave and go into the bedroom to kiss her goodbye but she says she’s decided to come after all. I wait ~10 min for her to get ready and she comes out grumpy and stressed. I ask if she’s sure she wants to come, she says yes

Fast forward about an hour and we’re probably 5 min away from the destination and she asks if she can just drop me off and catch a ride home with a friend. I say yeah that sounds good. She says okay cause going to the friends Christmas is her “worst nightmare” at the moment. 

We get to my friends house around 6pm and she says she doesn’t know what to do. I say if this is your worst nightmare than it’s probably less stressful for her to just drive home and relax for the night (I obviously want her at the party but would not be upset at all she decided to stay home, she works very hard). She says what if I come to the party but we leave early around 9pm? I reluctantly say I guess, trying to come to a compromise. She says I’ll stay till 9 but drive myself home. This is fine by me. 

10pm comes and we do white elephant gift wxhacge. At around midnight my fiancé and I decide to leave. While we leave my fiancé says we should go to her moms instead of home. I say that sounds good and she asks her mom if we can and she says yes but we have to park in the alley, my fiancé asks me if this is okay and I say yes and then My fiancé says we shouldn’t park in the alley and should go home instead. I say thats okay with me. 

I ask my fiancé one last time if she’s sure that she wants us to go home instead of her moms and she says “you choose” so I decide to go to her moms (closer by 45 min) as it’s the easier and safer choice and she tells me to just go home. She then says “don’t ask me to decide anything right now I am exhausted and stressed out “ I don’t say anything as I can see the situation escalating. 

She then says “I don’t know why you have an attitude, I thought you would be understanding with how stressed I am. Just because you have no stress doesn’t mean that I am stress free.

My friend Joe and I (who were both around 12) decided to play a game called Caroms (golf, but in board game form) several times. I won each and every time. (I had my own Caroms table, and I told him as much before our first ever game.) The same EXACT thing happened every Saturday for 2 months, until the final game. It is joe's turn, and he is currently going for the 9th, and final, hole. If he makes this shot, I lose. I hold my breath and ... he misses. Whew! On my turn I complete hole 7. However, you can gain an additional turn if you end up in the hole that you were going for at the start. Because I was going for hole 7, I get to take advantage of that rule. I am now going for hole 8. I line up my shot, make sure everything is perfect and shoot. HOLE IN ONE!!! I am now going for hole 9, but Joe's token is blocking the entrance to hole 9. If I want to win, I'll have to get creative. I came up with a plan. My plan was to either knock Joe's token into a sand trap and make him lose a turn or put enough power behind my shot that I can enter hole 9 anyway. By some miracle, I slid past Joe's token and into hole 9, winning the game. About 20 seconds later, I hear a loud wail and look over to see Joe crying RIVERS OF TEARS and whining and complaining. He was saying stuff like, ""It's not fair. I should have won. How did this happen? How did he get so lucky? He must have CHEATED,"" nonstop for around 30 minutes. Also, he and I NEVER played Caroms again. I initially believed that I did nothing wrong, however, I recently told this story to some friends and got mixed responses. Some of them said I was an asshole and that I should have let him win, as opposed to humiliating him and damaging our friendship. The rest of them said that it was Joe's fault for being a sore loser and that his parents should have raised him better. So, Reddit, AITA?

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Joe's parents were, and still are, divorced. Neither of them had remarried or were dating back then. Maybe that had an impact on his behavior that day?

&amp;#x200B;

PPS: We did stay friends for a few years after that day, we just played other games, like tennis. Sadly, he moved to Long Beach once we hit high school age and we hung out less and less as a result. We stopped hanging out altogether shortly after we both went to two different colleges. He and his family still send a Christmas card every year, though.

Enter my step-dad. My mother passed away several years ago. Her husband and I have never kept up a super close relationship. It's been mutual. He asks me very basic questions about work and family, and I do the same. Our phone calls are maybe 2 to 10 minutes at most, 2-3 times a year, plus birthday messages. 
This year, I'd sent him a text on Thanksgiving to wish him well. He apparently didn't get it until the next day, when I happened to text the same well wishes to his parents. He called me at 10:30pm the day after Thanksgiving to say ""fuck you"" and berate me for not calling the day of. I immediately apologized and tried to ask how their holiday went. But he cut me off to accuse me of ignoring a voicemail I never received (he's always insisted that technological glitches never happen). I was so surprised that I started crying. I just couldn't believe he was this upset over the situation. He hadn't even sent me so much as a birthday card for the last three years. I had no clue where this was coming from. Then he accused me of being a drug addict and an alcoholic because I was ""having too much of a reaction."" 
I feel genuinely bad if I made my step-dad and his family feel uncared for. But most of my texts have went unresponded to from his parents. I just never interpreted any of us as being that close. I tried apologizing again, expressing that I understood that this was important to him and that I wanted to be considerate. He accepted this much. But I also wanted to make it clear that he couldn't berate and insult me without apologizing/taking responsibility for it just because I'd done something hurtful. He said he'd never apologize for that. Then again accused me of being drunk and that he didn't care about my feedback.

To be perfectly honest our relationship has been on the skids for a while now. Everything was fine until we moved in together. I don’t know what happened but something just changed. Almost every interaction we have leads to a fight. Even the smallest things. I think she’s picking fights with me because she wants to break up with me but she doesn’t want to do it herself so she sees this as an easy out. She denies this but I can’t shake the feeling I’m right.

Yesterday we were doing our grocery shopping. We do our shopping together since we just have the one car and it's mine. Something set her off and she started arguing with me in the middle of Walmart, which embarrassed the shit out of me since I hate arguing in public. She quieted down until we were about to put our grocerys in the car when she started up again. It was at that point where I had enough and quickly threw my grocerys in the car and drove off. I just couldn’t take it anymore and I just wanted to be away from her. I didn’t think about it, I just did it.

Here’s where I kinda feel like a dick. We live in a really rural area and Walmart is like a 45+ minute drive from our house and it’s not like she could just take a Uber or Lyft or anything like that because there just ain't those out here. Also her purse was in the car which had her wallet, keys, phone etc. and I didn’t realize. So I kinda stranded her more or less in the middle of nowhere with no money and no way to call anyone to help her.

She eventually found a ride and got home hours later but she didn’t speak to me when she got home. She just stared daggers at me and went to bed and locked the bedroom door. I slept on the couch. She hasn’t spoken to me since.

Everyone I spoke to is split on the matter. Some people I talked to think she got what she deserved after how she treated me for the past few months. Other people I talked to think that was absolutely heartless of me to do regardless of how she treated me.

I will be honest, I was kind of fucking miserable these past few months and it took me doing that to fully realize that I’m not in a good place mentally with this person and that may have been the final nail in the coffin. On the other hand, I consider myself a kind person and I feel like I did a shitty thing when there were other non shitty things I could’ve done instead. Even after I got back home and I calmed down I still coulda went back and got her.

(M28)

Since I'm not close with my family, these past weeks I stayed more at my in law's place, to avoid staying on my own (my boyfriend works at 800km away) now that I'm having health issues (nothing serious). 

Now to the issue 

My SIL(F34), MIL and I were talking at the table after having eaten. I was opening up and talking about how I have been struggling with anxiety basically my whole life. SIL starts sharing her story as well and finishes by saying that one day she looked herself in the mirror, realized wasn't worth it and her anxiety was gone.

As soon as she finishes talking my eyes fill with tears and my mind starts racing and thinking ""why can't I do that? Why did I take medicine when I have the power to make it stop so easily? Or why don't I have such power? Maybe I'm not good enough, ecc..."". 

I am no longer myself and I just want to go to a safe place to cry by myself, so I leave the table and SIL grabs my wrist to let me stay but my anxiety had taken over. 

This all happened in a matter of seconds, and since then my SIL has been very cold and distant. 
We haven't spoken about the accident

After I raced to the bedroom I was using (I was also sleeping there), my MIL came after me to calm me down, which she did.
I rejoined the table but the atmosphere was dense and no one talked about my outburst.
This was on Tuesday.

Now my boyfriend is back for a couple of weeks, and we went to my in law's for dinner. My SIL barely made eye contact with me
 
One thing that bugged me happened around dinnertime. Since I'm on antibiotics, I was eating before everyone els to take my medicine. (It was some fish, and I have eaten about 1/6, so that I could eat with them when their food was ready)

I am at the table and I see her in the adjacent kitchen. She peeked to see what I was doing and was 'reporting' to my MIL in a very low voice because usually you can hear, so I know fro sure she was whispering

I shrugged it off and put a smile on for the rest of the evening. Towards the end she finally talked to me as well, but I could feel the hostility.

I haven't talked to anyone about this and about how I feel towards her. One obvious thing I did was not following her kid around as I used to be, also because I'm weak from antibiotics and I don't have the energy, plus bending continuously makes me nauseous.

This kid (2) is basically in love with me (and I with him), always looks for me and calls my name a lot. I think this is quite annoying to her because he prefers me over other people important to her.

I have laid pieces throughout our lives and made sure that pivotal moments of our bond was orchestrated for weaponized use. For example, when our father died was the perfect time to plant ""word bombs"" in his brain so he may cling to what I said or ""what happened when dad died"" every time he loops. When he came home drunk and laid out cold on the stoop, I left him out to suffer before I ultimately came out just to call him pathetic trash. Recently he tried to use this as ""ammo"" against me to his own friend and the look his friend gave me was one of absolute pity. He is right where I want him.

I will start by become the dominant male figure in his daughters psyche. Their psychic link is so disheveled that they both can read this and still be vulnerable to my psychic onslaught. My niece is in her teens and well beyond her years academically. The intellectual chasm between my brother and his child is a sight to behold. He is a dead beat dad. He learned from my father. As did I. So I will become the avatar of karma and wake him up to the reality where his most prized identities, this... ""father"", this ""brother"", this family man who ""changed your diapers"" and ""know more than you're going through than you know yourself"". When, in fact, his daughter tells me that she fears him an attention seeking drunkard in a loop, who only can blame her patient mom for any logical consistencies she uses to dismantle his controlling narrative. She will participate in a non profit community art center I'm currently renovating. I don't even have to be present in her life. Simply providing an outlet for her creativity, respecting her world view and properly guiding, not leading her, would be enough to crush the identity he clings to.

Pretty standard stuff. About 5 years ago, my daughter didn’t want to come on my weekends. I lived 3 hours away, so I knew the car ride was exhausting and I worked weekends. Her mom insisted on keeping her those weekends she didn’t want to come over and I foolishly agreed. At the time she was still coming down at least once a month. My days off I would try to come to her town to visit.

2 years ago, I took a job that had weekends off and moved 30 minutes from where she lives now. I took a pay cut but I didn’t care cause I was closer to my kid. At this point, she was coming down less. She does a lot of activities at school that takes up her free time, and I offered to drive her to whatever she had going on those weekends. Her mom kept telling me she didn’t want to come and instead of fighting it, I just let it go. I thought about taking her back to court, but didn’t want my kid mad at me cause I was taking her from what she had going on at school and her friends. I started noticing that she would always come around the holidays or if I told her we were going somewhere that weekend. 

I pay her mom $400 a month in child support. I live paycheck to paycheck and work two jobs to stay afloat. I’ve never been behind on payments.  I’ve always supported her extra school stuff and sent money to her mom when she asked. I worked 4 jobs at one point. Her mom hasn’t worked in 4 years. But when my daughter has school events going on, she nor her mom ever tell me about them. I find out over Facebook after it happened. Over the summer her mom asked if I would pitch in $300 for one of her activities. I didn’t see the text until about two weeks later and she never asked again or provided documentation of the costs. Shortly after I was getting cashapp notifications from my daughter asking for $300 but didn’t say why she needed the money, so I didn’t pay anything.

Every week I ask if she’s coming down and she always says no. This week was no different. We planned on doing Thanksgiving tomorrow and she told me she would come down today. Today I asked what time I was picking her up. She said she had a thing with her friends and would not be coming. I told her that I was getting upset because she hasn’t came down since July. She responded that her friends were more important and that I should pay for the stuff that she’s involved in and I don’t. I reminded her that I pay her mom $400 plus her phone bill every month, if she wants money from me then she needs to come around more often or at least invite me to her stuff. She said that my love is conditional on how much I see her. I said to call me when she wants to see me cause I’m tired of getting my hopes up.

He works away 2weeks and is back for 1 week. The kids have stopped asking if he is coming to see them on his week off.

My dad's birthday falls on a Wednesday, and I know my mum wants everyone in my family to be there.

So I decided today that I'd ask about unavailable days and put myself down as unavailable on his birthday. If I could, then I would, but if I couldn't, then there wasn't really anything I could do. When I told my dad about my plan, though, he wasn't too thrilled about it. He asked me why I'd want to put myself down as unavailable on that day, and I said: ""Because it's your birthday?""

He then tells me in a sarcastic voice: ""So does that mean I don't have to work because it's my birthday?"" A bit of context around my dad, he's usually out and about all the time, working. He's always going on about how he wants to be with his family as well. Me, knowing this, said in response: ""Well, I'm sorry I want to be with my family on my father's birthday."" He stopped talking after that, but I could tell he was angry with me for saying that.

There's a part of me that thinks I should've said it a bit nicer, but then again, I know my mum wants the family all together on his birthday. I can't tell if he didn't see it that way, or if I'm not seeing it in the right way, but idk anymore, AITA Reddit?

However around 1:30 in the afternoon I started wanting to go home because I wanted to be at home. He literally begged me to stay so I did because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings and make him feel like I didn’t want to be around him. he promised we would pull an all nighter but around 9 he started drifting off. He then asked me to give him an hour to sleep so I accepted so I could do my own thing while he slept. Well the hour mark rolls around and I wake him up and he asks for another hour so I let him. I’m on my phone when my anxiety starts acting up. I have coping strategies for my anxiety and I was using them but they weren’t helping so I go wake Oscar up in hopes that he could get up and help me through it. He says that I’m fine and to go to bed (by the time I woke him up I was in tears because of how scared I was) so I ended up calling my dad to come and get me. When I told Oscar I was going home he got pissed at me and said that I should just stay. After I got home I texted him letting him know that the reason why I left was due to anxiety and I couldn’t control it. He texted back that he wished I would have stayed and now i feel like shit for leaving him and I’m scared it’s gonna effect my friendship with Oscar.

So we were at a party last weekend in Vancouver, BC. I rode my electric scooter over there and this machine is no joke. It goes up to 80 Km/h (50 mph for Americans) and has dual motors. The scooter is a VSETT 10+ and goes as fast as a car! So after socializing and mingling a bit at the hosts house for an hour, we step outside.

I haven’t had a single drop of alcohol or a puff of weed because I’m riding it back later and I don’t want to cause an accident from wrecking when intoxicated. But my friend walks up to me and I know him for a year already so I let him drive my scooter before but he was always sober. This time though his breath smelled of weed. He told me he took 5 grams of shrooms. He also rides dirt bikes too. He said he wanted to take it for a rip around the park and talk to some girls. Im guessing he wanted to impress them but i don’t know.

Now I know the rules of using the road here and even in Canada where weed is legal its completely illegal to drive or operate a motor vehicle while high.  I politely refuse saying that its not safe for him to drive such a fast and hard accelerating scooter in this state especially since it goes 40+ mph easily. I’m worried that if his shrooms trip gets really bad he could start hallucinating while riding and cause a serious and maybe deadly accident. He starts getting defensive, speech slurred and accusing me of “profiling” him. After unsuccessful attempts to change his mind, he tries to activate the throttle on my handlebar while im standing on it. Luckily the power to the motors was cut off from my holding the brake lever or it would have accelerated into the crowd in front of me. I raise my voice loudly and tell him to buzz off and sober up, maybe go home. He walks off and gives me the finger.

The next day we reconciled over text and I apologized for the way I acted and he apologized too saying it was so unfair for him to act like that. I was only worried about his safety and those on the road.

I’m an 19 female art student with East Asian roots and decided to sell enamel pins of 2 anime characters I designed in a previous class. For reference one is inspired by Lolita fashion (think pink and sweet) and the other is inspired by The Raiden Shogun from Genshin Impact with full on cleavage. I also sold some packs of chocolate pupper sticker. 

Anyway the rules of participating is that you have to be work a shift or all your proceed goes to the school. So I did the grand opening shift from afternoon to closing. Ask around and  if it was busy that day they not really as it was mostly art collectors that were lining up. (So older wealthier people who can shill a couple thousand dollars on a painting or a sculpture). I sold two pins and one sticker pack that day. Not bad considering it was my first time selling.

Here’s where things gets bad; my mom picked me up. She came in and wanted to look. Nothing wrong with that but she ask where my pins are. I pointed where they were in a box on the table nicely lined up in a row (I had to be the one too file them so they didn’t look like an explosion went off). She ask why weren’t they displayed on the table. I said there were 1 or 2 showing each of the designs but they could’ve been put back when they move my stuff forward or people just put them back in the box while looking. (The people that we’re between 18-20s and typically East Asian). 

In the car she started going off on some conspiratorial rant how someone is deliberately hiding my pins “because they are so much better than everything else there and it’s so sad that there in a box.” And “How pure hearted I was for not thinking someone would screw me over” and some shit like that.

First of all I don’t know what that means it’s better than everything else cause everyone worked just as hard? Secondly I’m one in hundreds of students and you think my $10 pins and stickers are such a threat to a $4000 painting or a $80 hand made ceramic mug? 

In tears I  told her that the set up was out of my control and none of the artist really had a say on how it’s their art is set up. My stuff was being moved around that day to fill up empty space. And also people who were mostly coming were rich art collectors or older middle age white folk and those people aren’t likely to buy my work.

At this point my mom was calling me a racist and ageist against old people/white people buying my pins.

I was so fucking upset at this point because I never in my life been call a racist or ageist. LET ALONE BY MY OWN MOTHER!

I never said they can’t buy my work because I would like people to wear my pin and be comfortable wearing my pink sweet Lolita fashion pins or my cleavage exposed matcha theme anime girl pins.

Could I worded it better? Maybe it was in the heat in the moment.

I started yelling at them saying ""you guys are the worst parents ever and i wish you guys were never my parents"". My mom and my dad screamed at me, i then got my phone taken away for 1 week.

I made it very clear that I never wanted a pet, not even a fish, and she was totally understanding.  I'm allergic to Pet Dander and OCD about my home being clean.

3 months after we got married, we traveled to her hillbilly parents for Christmas. On Christmas day, they released these 2 dogs into the room and screamed. SUPRISE!! They got my wife a fully grown German Shepard and a Yorkie puppy as a Christmas gift... They did this behind my back. They didn't ask me if I would be ok with it or even thought they should run it by me first. We ended up getting into a huge argument, and I flew home alone that day. 

Apparently, her parents paid 2 or 3 thousand total for both dogs and couldn't get their money back. I don't believe that, but whatever. I offered to reinburse them whatever they paid to just rehome them. But my wife fell in love with them. I was preasured and relentlously hounded day after day into allowing these beasts into our home. 

It's now been 3 years. My once imaculant home is riddled in thousands of dollars in damage. The big one has every ailment a dog can get, I spend $280 a month on his medication. A 20-pound bag of medicated IBS dog food is $115. At any moment, he will take off running and plow into you like a goat, hoping to knock you down. The little one loves ripping each fiber out of the carpet and pissing into the exposed foam padding. He also loves to chew holes into the couch and piss into the stuffing. He pisses on the furniture, bed, shoes, really anything. I take him out, he will piss, come in, and directly piss on my couch. 

I told my wife 3 years ago when I gave in, I don't want to clean up after them, pet them, play with them, I want nothing to do with these dogs. They are your dogs your responsibility. Yet when it's pouring down rain,  I'm outside with them. Or when it's paying for their expensive vet bills, I'm paying. I'm nice to the dogs, iv never mistreated them,  but I hate them and wish every day that they were gone.

 I have to use an inhaler to be able to breathe in my home. It constantly stinks of piss and animal ass. I just want the dogs gone! My wife doesn't. My last straw, I walked into the front door yesterday with kfc. The big one plowed into the back of my leg, knocking me down. He ate half that bucket of chicken, bones, and all before I could get up off the floor. My hand was damp from the piss puddle the little one left on the floor. I washed my hands and just sat in my car. After about an hour of calming down, I walked back in to see vomit and feeces sprayed everywhere. On my couches, all over the carpets. The smell, oh my God.. it was like a sewer pipe opened in my house. I just went back to my car and waited for my wife to get home. 

I utterly hate my in-laws now. And honestly, I've started to resent my wife. These dogs have ruined my house. I nolonger even want to come home.  So, AITA for wanting to get rid of these beasts?

Yesterday he pulled a hangnail off his big toe and put it on the bedside table, I immediately said to him “please don’t leave it there it’s gross” to which he instantly huffed and said “I’m putting it in the bin when I next get up” there was an ashtray right next to him so I asked him to at least put it in there so it doesn’t end up on the floor as there’s a good chance he’ll forget about it and I’ll end up standing on it (his toenails are sharp af.) he got defensive saying he didn’t want to put it in there and told me I treat him like a child and all I do is constantly nag him and “speak to him like shit.” 
I got upset because I felt like it was a simple request to make both our lives easier as he didn’t even have to move from the bed and the toenail would be in the bin when the ashtray was emptied.

My bestie who I'll call ""Z"" not her name. Z has never struggled with mental health issues and her parents are very supportive, the only problem is they expect her to live up to the standards her brother set; he was basically a child genius and graduated from high school a year early. They've expressed that as long as she gets good grades she can do whatever she wants. Basically the opposite of how I was raised.

I should really focus on the main story. Last Friday was a health day at school, I've been stressed out about how my school doesn't want to accommodate my anxiety/adhd I don't think I mentioned that. So in order to not have to go to another town for high school I need to ""Just tough it up."" 

It was a mental health and career health day to be specific, I knew it'd be hard to get through the day but I had to I missed Thursday. In 5th or 6th period we watched a video about body image, it was supposed to help those without it to sympathize and those with it to understand it better.

Another person I'll call 'H' laughed at the video. Personally I don't like her but I won't go into it. Z called the video cringy. Which while it kinda could be considered that by someone actually mentally stable, it really helped me feel better. During the video Z turned to me and said "" You're ugly"" I know she meant to mock the video, I've never communicated outright that I'm not okay with teasing so it's not her fault but it hurt a lot. 

I was already shaking I really struggle with sharing my experiences and even writing them down felt like a huge task, so when she said that I just kinda sat in silence for 15 minutes while the class watched videos and talked about mental health. I was getting worse and worse by the minute so I asked the teacher to go to the washroom. When I came back H was sitting in my seat and didn't move when I asked her too another friend offered me a chair because of how badly I was shaking I asked H to move again and she asked why.

I find her very difficult to deal with and she's a trigger in her own way. I went out to the hallway and called my mom. I was crying at that point. I know I was dramatic and over reactive but these are real feelings I can't just turn them off. She let me come home and I told her just the stressful day and H part. She has a good opinion of Z and I don't want to ruin that.

Z never wants to talk about life just funny things, that's great for a friend not a best friend. She doesn't even try to sympathize or see things from my perspective. I hate that I can't share my full self with anyone, Z doesn't want to talk about serious stuff and my parents would kick me out if I told them everything. I just don't know what to do.

The thing about me and my sister is that both of us struggle with eating disorders. I have binge eating (plus I'm overweight) disorder and she has anorexia. 

Due to her disorder she's very conscious of her own weight and other people's weights. She keeps pointing out to people that they should lose weight. Not just to me - to everyone.

So when my nephew arrived yesterday she immediately started verbally attacking his body size. She said he gained weight and needed to lose some asap.

Now, I'll admit, when she says this stuff to me, it's fairly warranted because I do need to lose weight. But my nephew is of healthy weight.

So then her husband said she should look at herself and lose weight herself instead of berating people for their weight. She got extremely mad and started asking people to compare body sizes with her. 

I just didn't say anything at that point - which she perceived as me agreeing with her husband. I don't. I just keep getting attacked for my own body shape and that made me rather bitter and sort of unwilling to fight to protect her feelings.

She is upset with me. I WILL apologise if I get called out for being an asshole.

My cousin L's (m39) wife M (f35) does not get along with her inlaws/extended family. Shortly after they were married M overdosed and had to go to rehab, the good news is that she came out sober. However during that process she became convinced that all of her problems were because of her husband's family. Im very close with all of them I know everyone has always been supportive and helpful. (My family included)

As the years went on things got worse to the point where M won't participate in any family events or let my aunt/uncle/anyone spend any meaningful time with their kids. (Lots of hurt feelings on all sides) 

For the first time in 4+ years they came for Thanksgiving (my parents always host and it's usually a really fun time). L / M showed up 2 hours late, arriving just as we were carving the turkey. Our family tradition is that the youngest (who can talk) says grace which was the job of T's brother's youngest Z (m6). M refused to hold z's hand (apparently something she has done on multiple occasions). Now while this may seem like a little thing it's something that my cousin in law, K has not taken well, that and the fact that M generally ignores her kids at family gatherings. (I have a slight suspicion that there may be some racism at play but I can't confirm).

After dinner K was upset and told me what was bothering her. I agreed that I thought it was odd and that M's general demeanor suggested she did not want to be there at all.

Next thing I know K is telling L about what happened and that she was upset about it... Then L eventually told his wife M about what K said, then M is right in K's face calling her names, then just took her kids and stormed off (left the house). FWIW K didn't even respond to M just ignored her... major props. 

Later after M/L and their kids left my aunt and uncle were upset saying that they fear L/M may never come back and that the relationship may never get repaired. Everyone started to say that my K should not have said anything and just gotten over it for the sake of the family.

So I finally jumped in stood up for K and said that this was a no win scenario and that M was looking for a reason to leave and be upset, if it wasn't this it would be something else. Everyone has done their best to treat her well but she hasn't done the same. (Lots of general nodding). Also that this has been a common pattern and that it's not anyone's fault.

 Lewis (16m) is fairly new to our friendgroup and this will be his first time at my house. He is an atheist, which I am perfectly fine with. He knows that I'm a Christian and that my family is very religious, but that's as far into it we've talked about. 

 I know that if my parents notice he doesn't partake in the prayer, they may freak out. I wouldn't put it past them to go as far as kicking Lewis out. 

 So, Reddit, would I be the asshole if I explained the situation to Lewis and asked that he pretended to participate in the prayer? I would tell him that I understand he doesn't believe in that stuff and I respect that, but I would appreciate if he did this to satisfy my parents. I'm worried that this may be offensive in some way.

Of course that didn't stop some co workers from interpreting any of my actions toward this young woman as romantic interest on my part toward her . Rumors flew about me harboring romantic feelings for her and she confronted me and I assured her they were just bored idiots with nothing better to do than make up stories.

She left in early 2018 to give birth to her first baby and gave me her email to keep in touch. Because of the rumors I tried to limit the amount of times I e nailed her to certain holidays and her birthday. This past birthday (,September) I e nailed her as always to wish her a happy birthday. She of course e nailed me back to say thanks. 

About 2 days later I get an e mail from a strange account staring he was the husband of my friend and he would like me to back off and leave my friend alone because after reading through some of my e mails he isn't comfortable with my friendship with his wife  I wrote back that for the sake of their marriage I would comply. Thanksgiving was one of those holidays I would e mail her for but did not do so this year out of respect for her marriage 

She e nailed me yesterday to see what was up and I simply replied ask your husband.

I had an argument with my mom a few days back. She used the N-word (like, the old one? I don't know how to explain) and I may have given a judgy face while correcting her. She immediately jumped on me saying how she and most people her age grew up learning that word in reference to Africans and African-Americans, that that's how she knows them, and there's no fault on her side because she's not insulting anyone. For context, we are Indians and to be honest, much of foreign etiquette is unknown here especially to my mom's generation.
 
I tried explaining how that word is offensive but she never let me get in a word. Then my dad came to mom's defense too, and knowing my parents, I knew I had to shut up or otherwise she would use this incident later to make me feel bad about myself. Now I'm just confused about whether I was the bad person here, because my mom told me later on that what I said and the way I said it made her feel like an uneducated person with no manners. What's worse is that she now keeps on using that word because she KNOWS that it'll provoke me and she uses it on purpose while looking at me for a reaction.

For reference one is inspired by Lolita fashion (think pink and sweet) and the other is inspired by The Raiden Shogun from Genshin Impact with full on cleavage. I also sold some packs of chocolate pupper sticker. 

Anyway the rules of participating is that you have to be work a shift or all your proceed goes to the school. So I did the grand opening shift from afternoon to closing. Ask around and  if it was busy that day they not really as it was mostly art collectors that were lining up. (So older wealthier people who can shill a couple thousand dollars on a painting or a sculpture). I sold two pins and one sticker pack that day. Not bad considering it was my first time selling.

Here’s where things gets bad; my mom picked me up. She came in and wanted to look. Nothing wrong with that but she ask where my pins are. I pointed where they were in a box on the table nicely lined up in a row (I had to be the one too file them so they didn’t look like an explosion went off). She ask why weren’t they displayed on the table. I said there were 1 or 2 showing each of the designs but they could’ve been put back when they move my stuff forward or people just put them back in the box while looking. (The people that we’re between 18-20s and typically East Asian). 

In the car she started going off on some conspiratorial rant how someone is deliberately hiding my pins “because they are so much better than everything else there and it’s so sad that there in a box.” And “How pure hearted I was for not thinking someone would screw me over” and some shit like that.

First of all I don’t know what that means it’s better than everything else cause everyone worked just as hard? Secondly I’m one in hundreds of students and you think my $10 pins and stickers are such a threat to a $4000 painting or a $80 hand made ceramic mug? 

In tears I  told her that the set up was out of my control and none of the artist really had a say on how it’s their art is set up. My stuff was being moved around that day to fill up empty space. And also people who were mostly coming were rich art collectors or older middle age white folk and those people aren’t likely to buy my work.

At this point my mom was calling me a racist and ageist against old people/white people buying my pins.

I was so fucking upset at this point because I never in my life been call a racist or ageist. LET ALONE BY MY OWN MOTHER!

I never said they can’t buy my work because I would like people to wear my pin and be comfortable wearing my pink sweet Lolita fashion pins or my cleavage exposed matcha theme anime girl pins.

Could I worded it better? Maybe it was in the heat in the moment.

So AITA?

My cousin 32F told me 25F that she recently lost her twin pregnancy due to it being ectopic. 
She has 3 kids with her abusive  ex husband and she finally met a good guy and settled down with him a couple years after leaving her ex.


I told my boyfriend 26M and he said that my cousin is fine  and that she didn’t loose anything.He mentioned that she already has children and used it as a point to imply that what her situation is somehow diminished because she “already hit the goal” of having kids.

To his credit he said some stuff about the removal was needed to save her life etc and generally discussed it in a medical sense (he works in the medical field).

Certain things he said just lacked compassion and that didn’t sit well with me at all. 

I tried many different ways to show him that he was being calloused , telling him he need to see things from a human POV and that yes this may be just another Monday for him but it’s life altering for someone else.

His rebuttal was that it’s his medical POV and he’s not being calloused 

He said that  it’s sad that she lost the babies but it’s worse when he has to break the news to someone who doesn’t already have kids because this problem can affect fertility 


 I get what he’s saying but this isn’t a struggle contest and that “compassion” seemed disingenuous  especially when he went in with that -But - 

He said we will agree to disagree



And here is where I might be the asshole 

Earlier this year he learned that had of a particular type of cancer 

He was an absolute champ  and was so brave about everything. He caught it really early and had the affected body part removed.The surgery was likely curative but he did one round of chemo just in case and again ,that chemotherapy was rough and he knew how bad it can be because he’s had to deal with cancer patients b4. 

Some facts about his cancer 

It has a survival rate of almost 100% ,i think it was  95% or somewhere around there 

He caught it super early ,stage 1 

Chemo is rough regardless, however he had it much “easier” than most  because he did 1  compared to the many rounds other persons may be subjected to. 


He refused to listen to my logic and see my POV  with regards to my cousin so I flipped the scenario

Told him that “he’s ok “ and “he didn’t loose anything” (exact words he used when he spoke about my cousin) because he  had one round of chemo and he can survive just fine without the body part he had to remove.

I told him that other ppl had it worst and he shouldn’t make such a deal about it. He got mad and told me I’m minimizing his struggles and refuses to talk to me until I apologize.

I even attached a pic of his social media bio where he had Cancer survivor and some other  cancer related inspirational stuff

First and foremost, I'm wishing a very respectful and commemorative Black Friday to all of my African American friends, especially to my girls. In a world that is NSFW (not safe for women), I know that y'all have it harder than I do because of bad people, so I salute you for just existing and being strong about it I guess.

Yesterday, my friend Scher (also 22F) had Thanksgiving dinner with her boyfriend's family. It was actually her first time meeting his family, so she wanted to make a good impression. Now normally in this typa situation, Scher would ask me or another one of her friends via text imaging if her outfit was suitable or not. She does this for dates, concerts, revenge, parties; basically any event. I think she's insecure and it makes me feel bad, but I always try to support her and give her honest feedback so she can dress to her best potential. This time however, Scher didn't send me a text message til after. 

Around 6:30, she wrote to me that her dinner went nicely and asked for my honest opinion on what she wore \[photo attached\]. I responded, ""ooh it's givin summer camp, 8/10 💕""! Let me translate this message in case you're confused since it wasn't worded so well, I admit. I didn't mean the regular usage of ""summer camp""; I meaned that the outfit looked summery and ""camp"". I call things (clothes, mostly) ""camp"" a lot. If you don't know this meaning of ""camp"", please check out Urban Dictionary. When I use it, it's mostly a good thing, but 10/10 outfits can't be camp. In other words, good with bad elements that somehow keep it good. Scher didn't respond back quickly like usual, which I did notice, but there was nothing to think of so I didn't think anything of it perchance.

About an hour later, Scher actually showed up to my parent's house - interrupting our own family dinner - in tears because she was panicking that her ""summer camp"" outfit left a bad impression on my ex bf's parents. My positive text message somehow fully convinced her that she looked like a Girl Scout. I obviously tried to explain what I meant my summer camp, and while she understood and left with the rivers not aflow, she can't and won't see her outfit/whole closet the same ever again; in her own words.

This week I spent time with my in-laws. My BIL and SIL seem like good parents, but when the family is together, they have an annoying habit of taking off without first confirming that the other grownups are okay babysitting. The involuntary babysitting falls to my MIL, and she seemed exhausted, so I jumped in and spent time with Niece (4). Niece warmed up to me and kept seeking me out, asking me to play, etc.

Thanksgiving Day, after everyone had eaten dinner, most of the family was outside. Niece asked me if she could have some pie. MIL was nearby, so I checked with her, and she told me to ask Niece's parents. I took Niece outside and found her dad, who was playing a game. She asked, and he said it was fine if someone else got the pie. I brought her back in, where I made sure her jacket didn't get messy and helped her wash her face and hands after she ate. 

Later that night, I overheard SIL saying something about me. When I didn't react, she repeated more loudly that I'm ""the fun Aunt because she lets [niece] eat pie, when she hasn't eaten real food,"" sounding annoyed.

AITA for not wanting to pick up my daughter

I am 20M. Last year I had a daughter with my ex best thing to ever happen to me (my daughter not my ex lol). I have a good job so throughout the pregnancy she stayed home. She would spend around 500-700 monthly I just gave her a credit and it was her money no questions asked. It was fine until after the babies birth she wanted a car, hair done weekly, fact restaurants, etc. After a whole day of “work” 8hrs+ when I picked her she told me it was only going 2hrs or so no milk. When we got home I asked how much she get paid and tells me nothing. It was my day and wanted to play basketball so I was upset, since I have been waking up at 9 am and sleeping at 5am. I said it was a waste of a day she could’ve been with baby then a huge argument breaks out she calls her dad and leaves takes the baby. Doesn’t let me see her no matter how much I plead so I filed for court. That was 10 mos ago, I since then fell into depression became an alcoholic. If it weren’t for my friends, family, philosophy, and the smile app I would’ve gotten worse. I thought she’s young and if I was gone she couldn’t resent me. Well since then I made a lot of progress in life got a new gf, more friends, reconnect with family,etc. Her mother 21F goes back to college (I asked her to do it when we were together) 30mins away from me. She ask if I want to see and I went, it broke my heart she was crawling and walking but I couldn’t hold or anything it broke my heart. Since I seen her 3 times took off of work cleared my schedule she is warming up to me again playing like old times honestly highlight of my week. Just bought clothes, diapers, wipes, etc. Now that it’s winter my parents think I should 2 hrs a day to drive my daughter and her mother across campus 2mins. Instead of her taking the school bus. I told them no and now they are saying I am a bad father not wanting wake early and leave work early to do this. I told them her mother is the problem she chose this but they say it doesn’t matter.

We lived together briefly and she was seriously the most disgusting person I have ever met in terms of living conditions. Before anyone throws the mental health card, I genuinely think she is just unhygienic and it is not due to any underlying mental health conditions. 

We were in a social club and she was the “dorm manager” meaning she was in charge of chores. I think Marg just wanted a single bedroom which came with the position. The last straw was when she left for the summer and left the fridge full of food in our dorm when it was explicitly her responsibility to clean it. I had to return to school after I had gone home to clean it myself and sent in a complaint to remove her from the position. She got the boot.

I knew Marg was not happy with me after that but I didn’t particularly care because her disgusting conditions affected everyone in the dorm. She got different housing for the next year and I thought we were on OK terms, not amazing, but enough to be civil. I even helped her get into a different club on campus despite the fact that her grade point was too low. We were not close friends by any means, but civil. 

Over a year later, I hear from a mutual friend that Marg was talking shit about me to said friend’s boyfriend. Nothing specific, just eyerolling and gagging when my name came up. My friend’s boyfriend defended me and asked what that was for, but Marg had nothing positive to say. I was shocked to hear this because we hadn’t had any issues. I heard from another friend basically the same thing. Then a month after that I noticed she unfollowed me on everything. 

Timing was not ideal, as I was drunk when I noticed, so I shot her text and asked her point blank what the fuck her problem was. The conversation went no where. I ended up reaching out later and apologizing for firing off over text because I knew it wasn’t appropriate. However, I said I didn’t appreciate her talking shit about me and purposefully trying to slander me. She lied and said she has never said a word about me. I dropped it because I knew I wasn’t going to get the truth.

My dad purchased a new home that was about 1 hr away from me. Before he lived with his mom, so it was going to be my first thanksgiving spending it with him and my brother since he bought a new house.

We were all excited to be spending thanksgiving together because it's something we have never done before. None of us know how to cook, so my dad bought a thanksgiving dinner, and asked if I could pick it up before thanksgiving and go right away to his house. During that week, I was in the process of buying a car, because mine had mechanical issues, it kept breaking down so it was urgent for me to buy a new car.

So 1 day before thanksgiving, I go to the store to pick up the thanksgiving dinner (mind you pick up was like an hour), I pick up the food and I get a call from my mom asking me if I want to go look at cars at this dealership. Of course I said yes because I really needed a car, and I fell in love with a Honda they had, so I decided to purchase it. The whole process of buying the car ended up taking hours and by the end of the day I was exhausted to drive 1 hr to my dad's house. I texted my dad that I'll just go tomorrow because I got a new car, and his response was ""K. whatever"", not even congratulating me on my 1st big purchase.

Since I didn't want the thanksgiving food to rot in my car, I w/ good intention put it in my mom's fridge (since I live with her). I urged everybody in the house not to eat it bc it's our thanksgiving dinner with our dad. The next day I go to my dads house, thinking everything was fine &amp; when my dad comes home from work he calls me so angrily. He then starts cussing at me saying that he's going to throw the dinner away in the trash. I'm looking at him so confused asking him why, &amp; he said bc I didn't go to his house when I was supposed to and bc I put the food in my mom's fridge.

My parents have been divorced for 11 yrs, &amp; he still holds a grudge towards her. Meanwhile, my mom could care less about him. But he was so convinced that because I put the food in my mom's fridge that it automatically became poison and he didn't want to get poisoned. I'm still confused, telling him there's no way the food is poisoned because I put it in my mom's fridge and he said ""how do I know that, for all I know you might want to poison me too"". So for about 1 hr, he's shouting really loud at me saying how stupid I am for putting the food in my mom's fridge and saying how I ruined thanksgiving.

My dad ends up throwing the whole thanksgiving food in the trash, without at least letting me or my brother eat some first. On actual thanksgiving, I just was in my room the whole day starving. I didn't even eat that day because he was outside in the living room next to the kitchen, and I didn't even want to look at him. Since then, he constantly reminds me how stupid I am for ruining his thanksgiving.

That was about 9 months ago and I’ve since cut off all communication. I’ve moved and changed my phone number since then and they have no way to contact me which is exactly what I want.

Their girlfriend (my ex girlfriend, I might add) decided she was also moving in under the assumption that it would be fine since we were both friends, but didn’t pay rent because “she was still living at her own house”. Fast forward to January, her and her family decide to renovate said house. I’ve been told it would be done in March, June, July, October, this month, etc- and it is still not completed because she never goes over there to do anything unless it’s someone else’s idea. I get overwhelmed with there being so much stuff everywhere, and while this is a 2 bedroom apartment there is not enough space for 3 people without it being crowded. There are constantly dishes in the sink, laundry going 3-4 times more often than when it was just me, and I feel like I have no control over how clean my house is. 

I am the one who does the dishes, takes the trash out, switches the laundry over, and takes care of most things with the animals. I’m doing so much more work around the house than I was with just me and it’s constantly overwhelming. Reminder, only one of them has ever paid rent to even make up for that extra work.

They also have a puppy which I’ll admit has gotten a little better since I’ve talked to them about it, but is almost constantly causing an issue. He’s eating the carpet, tearing up my dogs toys, stressing my animals out, getting into the litter box. Their solution to that is to turn the litter box around or keep him blocked to just downstairs, but that is not fair to my animals to not be able to go to the bathroom or move around just because he is not trained, at least in my opinion. I also had to ask at least 5 times for them to stop stacking stuff on top of my hamster cage so he can breathe- and that still only resulted in it being half cleared off so I could at least open the top to get to him. 

Any time I try to push for efforts to be made towards moving it’s treated as though I’m the issue and that I have a personal problem with them, rather than seeing how this is not at all what we agreed to when I agreed to having a roommate.

My Fiancé and I agreed to purchase a fridge off someone that at the time, we considered a friend.
It helped her out as much, If not more, than it did us. 
She chose to move from a house to an apartment which meant that she had to downsize quite a bit. While our fridge was functional, hers was a bit nicer (ours would probably have become unusable in a year or so, whereas hers would last a few more years beyond that)
She originally told us that she would like $500 for it and she didn’t mind if it took us a year or so to pay it off, as she knew our financial position didn’t extend to cover the full cost immediately.
A few weeks after we had organised someone to hire a trailer and pick it up for us, she decided she wanted $600 for it. At that point it was already in our house and we had disposed of our previous fridge, so we had no choice but to agree to her demand. 
6 weeks later we had paid $100 towards it, but she decided to insist the remaining $500 be paid at $100 weekly.
We agreed to make the payments even tho it would leave us a bit short for groceries ect.
After making 3 more $100 payments each week, we had some bad luck, I fractured my ankle, meaning I couldn’t work and my pregnant fiancé was diagnosed with high blood pressure and gestational diabetes requiring daily insulin injections (unfortunately none of this was covered 
By our medical insurance and my workplace is dragging their feet approving workers compensation) We informed her immediately that we would not be able to make the last 2 payments of $100 straight away, and could only spare. $10 a week (we are currently relying on government payments and my grandfather just to pay our rent and utilities)
After my most recent doctors appointment (today) I again messaged her about our unfortunate situation and that we would only be able to continue giving her $10 per week and that we hoped she would Understand our unfortunate circumstances….

she responded…
“”$10 per week wasn't our agreement, and you can't assume that I'd be happy about it!! “”

While I  understand she is unhappy, the original agreement was for it to be paid within 12 months and we still have 6months left from the date we picked it up which even just paying the $10 a week would have it paid off with 6 weeks to spare from the original date we agreed upon.
If our circumstances were to change in the next few weeks. We would of course finalise the payments sooner..
But I can’t help but wonder, AITA for feeing bitter that:
1.. She changed the original agreement (even tho we tried our best to accommodate her)
2.

All the delivery driver knock on the door. They text me saying ""come outside "". After 20 seconds they say "" hello"". Friend went out. They said nobody was there.

He says he came the long way on the bicycle that he is tired, to please give a tip for his effort. I say do you have any coins because it felt like a lot of pressure.  She kept explaining that the tip is given there is no cash here. He keeps begging to go and look again. 

I am listening to this uncomfortable. She ends up asking for the food please and has to take it off him because he wouldn't let it go. She said thank you, and before he left he said please no tip? I came all the way with your food, I cycled a long way? It was not long. I live 10 minutes from city centre. I couldn't even enjoy the food.
