AITA?

Full context:
I met her in university and we were super close back then but I started to notice she is VERY materialistic and shallow… (she’d only date guys from certain ethnicity since she wants biracial baby, she loves to have her “model friends” around and talk about her “cool” friends she has, becomes gluten free if one her friend starts being one) There were some differences between us. She comes from a wealthy family too so she never had to hustle like I did. slowly but gradually I just grew apart from her and one day decided to stop talking to her.

I told her how I just can’t stand her and it’s not a good idea to pursue a friendship but she keeps on trying to reconnect…I think she doesn’t get it. But it’s just stressing me out just seeing her message pop up and I just want to block her.

I have OCD and having a cluttered home makes me anxious and I get frustrated really easily. I'm in therapy for the OCD and expressed frustration with a gift my MIL gave our son months ago. Therapist asked why I didn't just sell it. Its one of those bouncer things with toys all around it (circular shaped, noisy, and big). Our son really didn't use it much and it took up a lot of space in our living room so I decided to sell it. MIL gives our son new toys whenever she comes and they are usually large in size. The year she gave me this particular toy, I had told her what toys were okay by me and dad, and she decided to give him what she wanted anyway. I was mad because MIL blatantly disregarded our wishes, but my husband talked me into keeping it for a while and we've had it for months. 

Flash forward to today, I sell the toy because our kid just doesn't use it much and there was a lot of interest for it on Facebook. Husband realized I sold it and didn't really care when I told him why I sold it (baby doesn't use it, takes up space, etc.). This afternoon on a call with his mom she noticed it wasn't in the background and asked about it. I told her we sold it and she promptly hung up the phone and sent a text to hubby that said ""\_\_\_\_ selling a toy I BOUGHT for \_\_\_\_\_\_ is unacceptable, and you owe me the money she earned for selling it."". Then going on to say that I deprived my son the joy of playing with it later, and said I'm never grateful for the gifts she brings our kid (gifts I tell her not to give him because we want him to learn that having high quality stuff and taking care of them is better than having lots of cheap stuff to keep him busy. I want him to learn to entertain himself!).

My husband thinks we should just give her the money to keep the peace, but I think she should've listened in the first place, and given our son something he would enjoy. He never used the toy and didn't even notice it was gone today.

I (28 F) had a best friend/roommate Linda (fake name, 29F). Linda helped me 2 yrs ago when she offered me I could move to her city and share a one bedroom apt with her for 2 mths til her lease is finished and then we could find something larger together. I found a good job in her city and took her up that offer. Mind you, Linda had 2 large dogs in that flat with her. So for two months, we all lived  there.

I loved her dogs and valued her making room for me and helping me out that way.We found a larger apt and moved there together (separate rooms) and went halfsies on everything.

One of the dogs bit me in the face, I got stitches(the dog didnt have his vax done and i lied to the doctors that i was my vaxxed dog to protect her),it took 3 months of me begging her to have them vaxxed.

I like to clean when Im home alone and I dont like to point out what i had cleaned, which was something she did and told everyone she is the ONLY one cleaning the flat..Which was not true but if you dont brag about it then it wasnt done i guess.. i tried to discuss the small things but she would get upset and i felt bad because she had helped me out so much.

Months later, she lashed out at me about me taking a book from her room (it was on the table, she had her doors open and it was a book we had together), and made a point of how she would never dare to enter my room without my permission and it got to the point she had moved out. I had to change jobs so I can afford to pay rent by myself, was newly diagnosed with ADD and lost my best friend all at once.

I started talking to a guy through a dating app, then on socials and then he told me he knows the dog from my pics and somehow told me he had had sex with Linda **IN MY BED** when I was away a month after we had moved to the flat. (she had an elevated floor in her room basically having the bed a meter from the ceiling-so impractical) I wouldnt mind her doing it in my bed that much as long as I was aware and if she had **CHANGED THE SHEETS**. Also, I used to go away often and she changed partners VERY OFTEN. so who knows how many people she slept with there and arranged it so I didnt know. I was disgusted by the thought of that and I messaged her what a hypocrite she is making a deal out of a book while she was doing that. Didnt get a response so I posted something along the lines of ""if you ever move in with your best friend, make sure she doesnt fuck random dudes in your bed without changing the sheets"" on my story where even her mom saw it.

I know it was a childish move but it honestly made me feel better.. a mutual friend had reached out calling me an AH for calling Linda out like that but I probably wouldnt have had she responded or apologized.

Denise is the third eldest and has a lot of responsability in the big household we live in. Lately she's been going on this identity discovery as she has always struggled with her identity. Earlier in the year, Denise went through this really bad depression and suffers with anxiety so she decided to seek medical help and is currently on pills. In the summer, Denise asked us (f15, f18) to call her the English equivalent of 'big sister' instead of her name. She has always been back and forth with her choice of name since we were kids and we would always comply, we even used to call her this name years ago, but as a group we feel uncomfortable calling her this as we have lost respect and trust for her completely.

The name Denise wants us to call her has a lot of cultural importance and ""respect"" but we have none for her, our entire life we have had this relationship where it was of obedience and out of fear of her. It was like she was the star of the show and we were her stage hands, overtime she has grown more arrogant and narcissistic towards us even seeing it as a sign of disrespect when we have a different opinion. Denise is incapable of emotional intelligence yet acts like she is the most knowledgable, she is unaware of any of her wrong doings and consequences of her words/actions.

For example, in 2021 Denise and I have coincidentally dropped out of school due to mental health reasons however, she decided it would be okay to badmouth me and talk about how ""I am the failure and ruined our mother's life"" even though we both did the same thing, she eventually got the whole family to agree with her and I became an outcast. She is so confident in picking others apart but is incapable of looking at her own mistakes. This has made me lose complete trust in her. Another time was when she decided it was okay to call me and my 18yr old sister ""ugly"" and a ""challenge"" to apply make up on. When we confronted Denise about it she said sorry but won't take any accountability of psychological damages which just doesn't make sense since she takes everything to heart and still holds grudges against us even years after an event.

Denise is in this mind frame of thinking that everyone else is in the wrong apart from her and anything that doesn't align with her is considered disrespectful and rude, which she has openly admitted. I am tired of these complaints as it is simply not fair that she is always the one who gets her way in every way possible and she never would or has catered towards anyone else even when I have asked her. She is so used to being the centre of attention and now that everyone else has actually grown up to be their own individual person and can form their own opinions, she despises it.

Our plan is to go see her family on Thursday morning and afternoon, and then drive to my parents house to spend Thursday and Friday night there.  From our house, it is a 3 hour drive to my wife's uncle's (Bob) house where her family is gathering.  Then it is another 2 hour drive to my parents place from there.  And finally, an almost 4 hour drive home on Saturday.  A lot of driving, especially with two kids (5 &amp; 3.)

Our original plan was just to see my family, but my wife's favorite aunt (Viv) and uncle (Ray) are driving from out of state to visit this year and just decided this a couple weeks ago.  My wife hasn't seen them in almost 4 years and she's super excited.  They were supposed to arrive on Wednesday night, but I guess something in their plans changed and they aren't expecting to get in until late Thursday night, or possibly Friday morning.  My wife is disappointed.  She now wants to change our entire plans to plan around seeing this aunt and uncle.

She wants us to find a place to stay in her Bob's city so that she can spend time with her favorite Viv and Ray.  Bob doesn't have space for us to stay there because other family members are already staying with him, so it would have to be a hotel.  I did a quick check when my wife mentioned her idea, and there are no rooms available for cheaper than $500/night.  Unless we want to drive another hour away.  She would also want to spend the majority of the day on Friday with her family and go see my parents late Friday night.

I told her I don't want to sacrifice time with my family.  I haven't seen my parents since 4th of July and with my wife's plan, we would essentially sleep there Friday night and then head home Saturday.  I have to be back home on Sunday because I'm scheduled to be on-call for work that day, and there's no way I can find someone to switch with me.  

I told my wife if she wants to spend more time with her family, then she can drive there herself on Friday morning and I will stay at my parent's place.  I told her she can either take the kids with, or I will keep them with me, her choice.

He then said he would try find a ride from someone else, I let him know I will drive him if he can't find a ride. Keep in mind my ""price"" was the exact cost of gas to drive there and back and again to pick him up, any rideshare service would cost more than double and taxi would be triple. He ended up finding a ride several hours later and took a rideshare back which costed more than my offer. 
This morning he said that because we're roommates I shouldn't have asked him to pay and that he would drive me for free if I asked. I agree with that and I have driven him for free in the past and possibly should have yesterday especially because he was sick.

Now for context, I joined the army in 2013 and left home for bootcamp and was stationed another state. From the time I left for bootcamp, stationed in my new duty station, ending my contract in 2017, till now I have seen my family about 6 or so times. The reasons for this is that they live multiple states away, I had no money since I blew it off on stupid shit or I didn't get paid enough. But now I am working a good job and making good money and I work from home, I have more flexibility. 

So now back to my current dilemma. My mother wants to visit in January with my brother as a late christmas visit. Now don't get me wrong I love my mom and my brother. I love my family alot. I have nothing negative to say about them. I am just really lazy and a degenerate. I have been through many tragedies in a short time and it has reduced me to being an indoor recluse. I get nervous leaving my house, being around strangers, and I hate it when people are behind me or they look at me. I believe everyone is out to get me in same shape or form, as irrational as it sounds.

Now with my current job, I get 15 days a year. And anyone who has ever worked in corporate and is a wage slave like me, PTO is very precious. Plus, I rarely take PTO, because I don't see a need to. If I ever do take PTO it is for a new game that came out and I want to spend days playing it.

I understand life is really short. I have lost many people in my life in such a really short time span. I know my family will not be around forever and I need to make the most I can. Part of me does want to visit folks but the majority of me wants to stay indoors and play video games.

So a video of Erica being railed got passed around, and since we're identical twins it's basically impossible to tell us apart, so she claimed the person in the video was me. There was also shot glasses, handles, bongs, vape box mods, and I think some pills, etc visible in the video. The school found out and I got suspended and grounded to all fuck when I got home.

Erica got home after school was over and didn't really interact with me, so I went to her room and told her to confess that she was the one in the video. She said ""no, but if you take the fall for it i'll give you like an ounce of weed.""

I told her to go fuck herself and then asked my parents to look at the video again. Erica and I both wear matching cross necklaces but mine is silver and hers is gold. You could see a little bit of the gold cross in the video, so I pointed it out and said that proved it was Erica and not me.

They confronted her with it and her only excuse was ""well clearly she photoshopped it to look like it's gold."" Even as technologically illiterate as my parents are, they could tell she was full of shit. I got my phone, car keys, laptop, and other shit back. They even took the Life 360 off my phone since I had ""proved I could be trusted"". Erica got in even more trouble than I would have been. My parents are discussing sending her to military school for the rest of junior and senior year.

Erica told me I should go fuck myself and that she wouldn't be able to go have fun or go to parties until she moved out, but tbh that's kind of what she needs.

So I decided to craft the most delicious homemade mashed potatoes that I could, so I did a test run of them this weekend and they were amazing. I sent a picture of them to my grandmother and told her how delicious they were and she STILL doesn't want me to bring anything. WIBTA if I brought my potatoes anyway out of spite?

My wife has been diagnosed with a health condition that requier 6 months of treatment and it caused her to distance herself from everybody. I take care of her while also working full time job.



My sister comes over to help keep the house clean. She would bring my nephew ""Adam"" (18) to help which made me feel so grateful. Since his passion is piano playing and always wants to do it as a career but he never had a real piano to practice with since his dad think it's a waste of time. I decided to buy him a piano and gift it to him on christmas.I told him about it to get info on what brand he wanted.



All was going well until days ago. I went to work. Tried to call my wife but got no response. I called again then texted but no response. I left work in a hurry thinking somethinh bad happened. I came home and she wasn't there. Turned out she was at her mom's place and was crying and refused to speak to me. Her mother told me that she recieved a package that was sent to me allegedly by my ""girlfriend"". I was so confused especially seeing the teddy bear saying it was for my birthday (which is tomorrow). My wife thought I had a girlfriend that sent me this teddy bear but in reality, Adam (who's a known prakster in the family) was the one who fabricated this whole thing as a ""prank"". How did I find out? My niece called me to warn me but it was too late. I was so furious especially seeing how he made my wife feel distressed and upset which affected her health. I went over to my sister's home and confronted him then told him I was taking back the gift I promised him with. He began crying saying he was sorry but I left immediately.

They live in a small apartment, my dog is pretty big and does not fit well there, so it's easier for them to come to us. Our dogs get along great, and we were all excited about the party.

About a week ago I found out that one of my favorite bands from US is having a concert in my town on the day of the party. I live in a small Balkan country and this kind of concerts are rare here. The band I want see exists for more than 20 years and this is their first concert here. It's not even a solo concert - they are one of the three acts preforming. It is not likely that they will come back any time soon.

It wasn't likely that I'll be able to go, so didn't mention anything to friends. The biggest problem was money for tickets. With holidays coming up, my dogs neutering bill and lack of the school excursions on which I work on, I didn't have any extra cash. But, I got paid earlier than expected and a few new excursions were announced so now, only a week before the concet date, it's possible for me to go.

Friends are more and more excited about the ""party"", they bought hats for our dogs, planned some board games for us to play. It all sounds great, but I wanted to see the band live for more than 10 years and this might be my only chance. 

I was planning on inviting friends to the concert (bf said he will go with me) even though I'm not sure will they be interested in it and rescheduling the party, but bf said that it's better to make up some different excuse because it would make me an AH to cancel something that was agreed upon before for something I want, but I don't want to lie to them.

I feel bad because of all the excitement for the party (I'm excited too) but I also don't want to miss out on something that I wanted for years and I need a second opinion.

A little background - Someone (Family, Friend, Stranger, whoever) have been in need of getting transportation and I offered to help take them somewhere as long we leave early or on time. I also mentioned that I will not leave if we're going to be late, because I would not do it.

Day rolls around and then here come a day that this gentlemen was not coming out on time and not in the vehicle ready to go. I went ahead and left the place. He have an appointment to go to.

I do not feel safe of leaving late or having to deal with emotional wreck of leaving late and I don't want to be speeding. I do not have another human life point, nor another vehicle if something had to happen.

Since I left on time and leave him behind, I've been getting ton of messages from him saying that I'm in the wrong - no matter what I said regarding my safety or my term.

I've agreed to him but I hold firm on the leave time or leave early time. He had never been late before. I'm being told I'm wrong for leaving him and that he have to pay a new bill for not cancelling within 24 hours.

Despite he was in an accident and have no vehicle, no job, and is trying to make a better recovery so he will stop asking for help.

I just had a conversation with my S/O and wanted to ask the community to see if i'm wrong for even suggesting it.

Essentially, we are visiting my in laws who are great people. We last visited in April so they can meet our then 8 month old, however we generally only get to come down once a year. My MIL is a heavy smoker and this visit I have noticed that she now smokes in the house a lot more. I have a 5 year old, and a baby who is almost 1.5 years old. My baby was getting over RSV before we came down a few days ago and did great in their DR appointment days before we came. My daughter is sick as well and received a steroid the day we started driving to my in laws in Texas.

They are both starting to get worse **and** because there is a lot of second hand smoke I'm concerned that I need to give them a break because they aren't use to this as my S/O and I do not smoke. So I suggested that we get a hotel room for at least a night or more and visit throughout the day to give the children a break on their lungs. My S/O didn't really contribute much to this conversation. They didn't get super mad or anything, but started out denying the house is smokey, and that they were sick before we came, and the 2nd hand smoke isn't the reason they are getting sick. Other then that they were mostly just giving one word replies. I got frustrated because I felt we needed to have an actual discussion and that our children's health should be a priority, so my S/O responded frustrated saying I can take them to a hotel and she doesn't care then wanted to be done with the conversation.

We didn't yell at eachother or anything, but I was **curious if i'm overreacting about the 2nd hand smoke?**

**\*\*USEFUL BACKGROUND INFO\*\***

My S/O doesn't get to see her parents a ton (once a year sometimes more). This is something that does bother her, as her mom brings up everytime they see eachother how she wants her to come home. I understand this as a parent myself, and have told my S/O that if she wants to we will move back. Additionally, we live near my parents. Now my S/O loves my family, she actually gets along with them very well. ( they go out on girls night, my S/O and mom got a matching tattoo to symbolize each other, etc) But i'm sure this can feel unfair. On top of that, my Inlaws have medical issues and even though they used to travel to see a family friend who they worked for, ever since the family friend passed, they haven't been traveling and never really came to see us even when they were. The relationship is pretty much one-sided when it comes to seeing each other so this time we get with them is crucial.

I'm saying this background information to essentially summarize the frequency in which we visit which can be the reason my S/O didn't fully like the kids not staying 100% of the time with her family.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4812515,public,top,self,AITA for suggesting to remove kids from Inlaws mid stay?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z13t8p/aita_for_suggesting_to_remove_kids_from_inlaws/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Denise is the third eldest and has a lot of responsability in the big household we live in. Lately she's been going on this identity discovery as she has always struggled with her identity. Earlier in the year, Denise went through this depression and suffers with anxiety so she decided to seek medical help and is currently on pills. In the summer, Denise asked us (f15, f18) to call her by the English equivalent of 'big sister' instead of her name. She has always been back and forth with her choice of name since we were kids and we would always comply, we even used to address her by ""big sister"" years ago, but as a group we feel uncomfortable calling her this as we have lost respect and trust for her completely.

The name Denise wants us to call her has a lot of cultural importance and ""respect"" but we have none for her, our entire life we have had this relationship where it was of obedience and fear of her. It was like she was the star of the show and we were her stage hands, overtime she has grown more arrogant and narcissistic towards us even seeing it as a sign of disrespect when we have a different opinion. Denise is incapable of emotional intelligence yet acts like she is the most knowledgable, she is unaware of any of her wrong doings and consequences of her words/actions.

For example, in 2021 Denise and I have coincidentally dropped out of school due to mental health reasons however, she decided it would be okay to badmouth me and talk about how ""I am the failure and ruined our mother's life"" even though we both did the same thing, she eventually got the whole family to agree with her and I became an outcast. She is so confident in picking others apart but is incapable of looking at her own mistakes. This has made me lose complete trust in her. Another time was when she decided it was okay to call me and my 18yr old sister ""ugly"" and a ""challenge"" to apply make up on. When we confronted Denise about it she said sorry but won't take any accountability of psychological damages which just doesn't make sense since she takes everything to heart and still holds grudges against us even years after an event.

Denise is in this mind frame of thinking that everyone else is in the wrong apart from her and anything that doesn't align with her is considered disrespectful and rude, which she has openly admitted. I am tired of these complaints as it is simply not fair that she is always the one who gets her way in every way possible and she never would or has catered towards anyone else even when I have asked her.

I(23M) and my Girlfriend(22F(Now Ex)) Decided to go to a bar to watch the saints game sunday. I know she doesnt like football but i never did something like that before and thought i should invite her and some of my close friends out. She agreed Under the condition that she can invite 2 of her friends out. I seen no problem with it and thought the more the merrier.

After arriving to the bar and getting a nice spot for all of us to fuck off my GF's friends show up. One of them ""Racheal""(F) is known for being expressive to say the least. I dont mind however as most of the time it doesnt hurt anyone. Although when it does hurt someone ive always been lucky enough to not get in the crossfire.

So once the game starts me and my friends were fired up and watching the game with joy (even though 1 of them was a rams fan). The girls was rightfully bored so they proposed a game where we are only allowed to drink when something interesting happens. We agreed because we didnt want them to be left out. After about 3 tall glasses in most of us are roughty. my girlfriend (whom i didnt noticed was on the other side of the building) started stripping. I cant even make this up, She got on top of the table and took off her shirt and was dancing. 

Saying i was pissed was an understatement. I told her we were leaving and i admit i grabbed her arm kinda forcefully. Racheal said what was the rush as things are just getting fun and i didn't want to hear anyones bullshit. I got one of my friends to drop us off at home and i said some very rude things regarding her decentcy to do that. We ended up getting into a big argument and she stayed with racheal for the night. Today she texted me and said we should take a break.

We don't want to go anywhere for Thanksgiving. Its our holiday too and don't want to spend our day off essentially babysitting the whole time. 

Again we're child free and want to spend the day playing games, watching the parade, drinking/smoking (legal state). We don't want to drive especially with drunks on the road.

Because his ex-wife was an extremely neglectful mother, he won full custody years ago and I have raised his children as my own for over 15 years. 

10 years ago, on two separate occassions, we caught our then 20-year-old daughters in a lie that they were at work when they actually were at another place they refused to tell us, likely at a guy's place. My husband and I decided to kick them out, and we have not spoken to them since nor have they contacted us.

Our relationship to our children have been complicated, and it is very disheartening to see our daughters abandon us and all our sacrifices, AND reunite with their birth mother who abandoned and neglected them for years on end. 

All that said, I understand he has complicated feelings about this, with a lot of anger, and often when referring to his daughters, he has called them ""b*tches"" or ""h*es"". I understand he is just angry and doesn't truly mean it, and I don't feel it is my place to say anything when he's processing how he's feeling.

All that said, what has made me reconsider this is a recent incident with my daughter (15F) from our marriage. She borrowed my husband's laptop, accidentally broke it, told me, and we agreed to get it secretly repaired, in secret because my husband has unpublished creative writing stories on there that he fears computer repairmen would find and steal. Long story short, my husband found out what we did, and in a moment of anger, he called my daughter a b*tch. I demanded him to take it back and he later profusely apologized and feels horrible for what he did.

I refused and suggested he wear a suit or even casual if he wanted but he said no and INSISTED of showing up in his uniform -- like he's going to be wearing the whole thing! I can't image how awkward this will make my family feel. He got upset and said that apparently, I'm ashamed of him and think that his brode was a joke but I told him that it's not normal at least not with my family.

My mom (50F), my partner(18M) and I(18F) were talking about the Covid situation and who wears masks in the environments we all spend time in.  

My mom mentioned how some people are really anti mask in a very obnoxious way, my boyfriend concurred and I remembered something my dad said to me a few times after my martial arts class (I am the only one in my class who wears a mask). He’d said that I should stop wearing a mask, that people must think I am weird. I told him that being careful with other’s health is important to me, especially since my partner is somewhat immunocompromised. He then mumbled about me being brainwashed and just “following the status quo”. After I remembered this anecdote, I turned to my partner and recounted it to him in almost those exact words, after giggling a little.  

He responded that he thought it was funny my dad says I was following the status quo if I’m the only one wearing a mask.  

My mom then said, pretty unhappily, that my dad was just making sure people didn’t think I was weird in his own way and that he wasn’t forcing me to not wear one.  

I argued that if that was really his intention, he wouldn’t have called me brainwashed, since that’s mean and not likely to convince me.  

She then switched to French (my mom and I’s first language that my partner does not speak) and said that I shouldn’t bash my dad like that in front of my partner.  

I kept speaking English and said that simply recounting what my dad said isn’t bashing and that my partner and I have been together for 2 years and he already knows what my dad is like.  

This devolved into a huge fight (me speaking English and my mom speaking French) she called me heartless and cold, said I was breaking her heart. She said my dad would be better if I just didn’t speak badly of him. I said she was deluded if she thought my dad would change, especially with how badly he treats her and that the conversations where he insults me usually start with me doing something unrelated to him and him getting angry while I’m trying to be nice.  

My partner thinks I’m definitely in the right and thinks it’s funny the way my mom tried to hide obvious things from him.  

This morning however, my mom explained that I really hurt her and that she wished I wouldn’t talk about my dad like that. She said that I kept going without considering her feelings and that he would be dead soon, so I need to be better with him. She also talked about how often she gets into fights with him in order to defend me from him and that she’s sad that this is how I repay her.  

I feel bad for hurting her feelings and think that continuing while she seemed hurt might make me the asshole, but at the same time I don’t see why she was upset over me recounting something that actually happened to someone who is my confidant in front of her, it’s not like I was lying.

I (28 F) had a best friend/roommate Linda (fake name, 29F). Linda helped me 2 yrs ago when she offered me I could move to her city and share a one bedroom apt with her for 2 mths til her lease is finished and then we could find something larger together. I found a good job in her city and took her up that offer. Mind you, Linda had 2 large dogs in that flat with her. So for two months, we all lived  there.

I loved her dogs and valued her making room for me and helping me out that way.We found a larger apt and moved there together (separate rooms) and went halfsies on everything.

One of the dogs bit me in the face, I got stitches(the dog didnt have his vax done and i lied to the doctors that i was my vaxxed dog to protect her),it took 3 months of me begging her to have them vaxxed.

I like to clean when Im home alone and I dont like to point out what i had cleaned, which was something she did and told everyone she is the ONLY one cleaning the flat..Which was not true but if you dont brag about it then it wasnt done i guess.. i tried to discuss the small things but she would get upset and i felt bad because she had helped me out so much.

Months later, she lashed out at me about me taking a book from her room (it was on the table, she had her doors open and it was a book we had together), and made a point of how she would never dare to enter my room without my permission and it got to the point she had moved out. I had to change jobs so I can afford to pay rent by myself, was newly diagnosed with ADD and lost my best friend all at once.

I started talking to a guy through a dating app, then on socials and then he told me he knows the dog from my pics and somehow told me he had had sex with Linda **IN MY BED** when I was away a month after we had moved to the flat. (she had an elevated floor in her room basically having the bed a meter from the ceiling-so impractical) I wouldnt mind her doing it in my bed that much as long as I was aware and if she had **CHANGED THE SHEETS**. Also, I used to go away often and she changed partners VERY OFTEN. so who knows how many people she slept with there and arranged it so I didnt know. I was disgusted by the thought of that and I messaged her what a hypocrite she is making a deal out of a book while she was doing that. Didnt get a response so I posted something along the lines of ""if you ever move in with your best friend, make sure she doesnt fuck random dudes in your bed without changing the sheets"" on my story where even her mom saw it.

I know it was a childish move but it honestly made me feel better.. a mutual friend had reached out calling me an AH for calling Linda out like that but I probably wouldnt have had she responded or apologized.

We got engaged in January 2020 and because of our unexpectedly long engagement, we decided to change-up our wedding/honeymoon plans and save up for something super nice.

My sister (21f) is getting married early next next year to her fiancé (21m). They are both college students without much income and thus have a much smaller budget including no honeymoon.

My parents gave my sister and I $5k each for our weddings. Both of our parents-in-law also contributed $5k each so in total, each couple received $10k for their respective weddings. 

When my sister found out about how much my then-fiance and I had saved for our wedding, she said it was unfair that I got $5k from our parents when I didn’t ‘need’ it. She proposed that my parents give her $10k instead of $5k for us both. This made no sense to either my husband or I and we told her so. However, she would continually ask me, subtly and unsubtly, for her $5k “back” (her words not mine). She also begun formulating theories about the “true” reason for my refusal to give them $5k including among others, my secret disapproval for her fiancé (in reality, I am neutral considering I have only met him once). 

My sister and I have never been super close due to our age difference but we have never had any major disagreements until this. Since then, our relationship has only gotten more and more strained until a few months ago when I basically stopped responding to her messages. After a few weeks of radio silence, she stopped messaging me though she continued asking relatives for updates about my wedding. Thankfully, at my wedding we basically ignored each other the whole time which was fine by me.

On my honeymoon, I posted on Instagram 3 times. Once after the first day, again after the first week and then the final post on the last day. They were basically just vacation pics of what we were doing. After the second post, my sister messaged me (the first time in months) to stop posting photos of my honeymoon because it “felt like a punch in the face to see what I was being denied.” I ignored the message because honestly, I didn’t want to spend part of my honeymoon writing up a response for why I should be allowed to post photos on my own Instagram account. My third post included a very long caption dedicated to my husband (written without a thought to my sister). However, my sister has interpreted parts of the caption as passive-aggressive attacks on her (all tying back to my supposed secret disapproval at her engagement). She has since run to our parents and told them her side of the story and they have since messaged me about my “mean-spirited Instagram post”. 

I asked my friends for their opinion and they are split.

They would go on vacations every year and buy new clothes for their kids every week. 

I had my toys and even furniture at my dads house given to my siblings, at Christmas they would give me clothes that were obviously too small and then give those to my sisters right after I opened it because they knew it would be too small. Even on vacations that I went with them on, they would ask me to babysit or take family pictures of them and any pictures I was in, my stepmom would later crop me out of. I wasn’t allowed to use some of the towels or sheets as they were reserved for the family and not for me, they were the “good towels and sheets” not for my use, I got to use the old ones and sheets that didn’t fit. I was also told it was my responsibility to take care of my sisters and clean, I would even have to clean their rooms. 

My stepmom couldn’t stand any attention going towards me even when I moved to uni she told my dad she had a depressive episode and he had to take the kids to the zoo instead of helping me but when his other daughter went to uni they helped her move in, stayed the weekend and even decorated for her. 

My stepmom always used her depression to her advantage to get my dad to take care of her or prioritize her kids if I needed him. She made comments as I got into high school and made me feel bad about myself. 

After the divorce I didn’t think I would be seeing her as often, but my dad invites her to all holidays and events as she is the mother of his kids but he knows how she was towards me and he never stopped her when she those things in front of him, he never told her it wasn’t ok and he still doesn’t think it was wrong because she was depressed. He keeps choosing her over me and he knows she makes me uncomfortable. When I stopped visiting my dad her depression was suddenly manageable and she is so much happier, the whole family is. 

When I bring it up with my family that I’m not comfortable around her, they say I should just let it go and forgive her, but I can’t. My dad never wants to discuss it and he will defend her actions. They act like I’m the unreasonable one.

I needed a big change in my life so I shut down my company and spent over a year preparing for a move out here. I converted a van and traveled across with my clothes and a lot of tools ready to help my friend. My plan was to use this place as a launch pad for me to explore and find somewhere I like and want to live. 

My friend told me that I could stay here for free, I never ever expected to stay anywhere for free...I am responsible and am very concious about using resources. I agreed I would take over paying all of the utilities and would still help my friend with the house. Keep in mind I do not sleep in the house as I'm very comfortable in my van that I did a decent conversion on. I keep it heated with a diesel furnace. I do not use his kitchen as I have my own, I do use the bathroom to shower and crap. But I did bring alot of tools and clothes and things so I have some stuff in a garage and some stuff in the small bedroom. 

I made a joke about finding a woman to date and then it seemed my friend started to feel like I was going to leave and he needed to get as much resources out of me as possible. 

I knew I wouldn't be paid for the work I did (I'm a very experienced licensed electrician and regularly charge $100 an hour for regular hours work) I want to help my friend but I feel like he is being unreasonable. 

I said I would pay all of the utilities, Trash, water, electric, gas. Fine, then my friend proceeds to say that he plans on heating the other half of the house that he hasn't used in a year and I knew that it would be a big expense because it's larger than the side he's currently living in and not well insulated. Ok, now I start to get a bad feeling. I express to him that I don't feel comfortable with that. He acts like he's doing me a huge favor when I feel like he's trying to take advantage of me.

I don't expect to be paid but for my friend I think $20 an hour is more than reasonable to apply towards a rent in addition to paying the utilities. 

He hasnt worked in over a year and is burning through his savings, he doesnt have enough capital to do all the projects he wants to do. He asked me for a flat amount each month and now I just have a bad taste in my mouth about the whole thing. Am I being unreasonable in my thinking? Lesson learned, sometimes with friends taking a business approach is more appropriate.

The title could have been rephrased better, but I didn't know how to describe the situation.

So, here is my dilemma. I signed up for a band in my school, as a drummer. The guy who organised the band is just trying to make things work out, and I really feel bad for him as all of us in the band keep arguing about nonsense all the time.

The vocalists in the band really don't give a damn about me or drums in general. They always blame any mistakes on me, and keep going on about how we would all be better off without me in band.

This hurt more than it should have, to be honest. Anyways, yesterday, we were all jamming together, and the vocalists were singing extremely slow. The whole song sounded horrible, and I tried to keep on beat by playing at the right speed. After playing, all the instrumentalists instantly started arguing with the vocalists. I tried to get in, and then all the vocalists instantly jumped to the conclusion that ""the drummer was playing too fast"", and somehow everyone in the band pinpointed it all at me. 

After all this shit, I just lost it. I put down my drum sticks, started yelling and swearing at them, and told them that I would not play the drums. 

The rest of the session, I refused to play. I wanted those vocalists to understand how important my role was, but most of all, I didn't want to get picked on any more. The owner of the band seemed really sad, and I really regretted saying that, but I was too deep into my petty argument to back out.

However, I don’t want anymore children. Kids are a lot of work, and it’s just not something I want to do all over again. I like the perks that come with just having one.

It’s required a lot of hard work, and I feel I can relax more often times than not as opposed to when she was younger and needed me more. Of course she still needs me, but not like she did when she was a toddler or a young child. The thought of starting all over with another one is overwhelming. My family and friends are constantly making comments about how I should just have another one because my biological clock is ticking and that my husband might want one in the future and will resent me for not giving him one. I think that those comments are completely out of line and none of their business. The other day, we had friends and family over for dinner. They were butting into my life again and making their rude remarks about my husband leaving me in the future and that I’m getting old, so I snapped. I literally roasted everyone. I pulled a Michael Scott from The Office and told them that I don’t want more kids because I see how much they struggle either financially, to get them in control, and how they’re always so tired because of how much their kids drain them. When everyone left, my husband said I didn’t need to go that far and that I acted like an asshole to everyone. He said my comments were rude and more out of line than their “suggestions”.

The apartment has nine rooms, all filled with documents, memorabilia, broken or very used designer furniture and personal items. He never moved out - he simply couldn’t muster the energy to clean it all up - and so they were never married.

His girlfriend isn't mentioned in any will, probably because he expected to be married to her soon enough for it not to matter. Legally, she inherits nothing. She's now asked us to give her two things to remember him by: a wristwatch and a silver bowl.

It just so happens that these are the two most valuable items in the entire apartment. Probably around $10,000 each.

We don't know if he promised them to her or if she’s just scoped them out when visiting him. We do know that he's already given her gifts worth around $100,000, and that she's well off financially.

Liz (29/F) and I (29/F) have been friends since high school. We have had a ""long distance friendship"" since I moved away from my hometown for school and work opportunities. Since then, I've met an amazing man and our wedding is in a few months. We currently live overseas for work, which makes wedding planning a bit stressful.  

Our wedding is about 80 people and we have a normal size bridal party. I have 4 bridesmaids, 1 is my sister and the other is the sister of my fiancé whom I am close with. The other 2 are my lifelong best friends, one whom I've known since elementary school and the other from college/adult life. There was no question who my bridesmaids would be.

This is where Liz comes in. I asked her for her address for the RSVP. She then found my wedding website (""the knot"") and absolutely exploded on me via social media to demand why she was not asked to be a bridesmaid. I tried to approach her with compassion and understanding because I know it must hurt to realize that she may be closer to me than I am to her, and I reassured her that even though our bridal party was small we would be honored if she and her husband could join as our guests. I even told her that we cut out large amounts of cousins and extended family to ensure our dear friends could be invited (we are paying for the wedding). She went nuclear and gave me the ultimatum that either I make her a bridesmaid or our friendship was over because ""I have shown my true colors."" I was honest and told her that we would not budge on our decision. She said that if we wouldn't expand, then I should simply replace my college best friend with her. The audacity!!!!! 

I firmly said no, and then she proceeded to say some terrible things about myself, my sister, and my best friends before blocking me.

Liz then tried to burn my world down by cold calling one of my bridesmaids (the best friend since college who she has never met) to say that she ""needs to know the truth about the bride"" and tried to tell her wicked lies to turn her against me. My best friend immediately shut her down and blocked her.

I've since gone no contact with Liz. I'm hurt about the volatile loss of a friendship over the bridal party.

The kicker? She can't even come to the wedding because she bought concert tickets for that Saturday after asking me for the wedding date months ago.

Then we decided to get dinner as a family and i suggested a diner close by but my sister wanted steak so we went somewhere else again no biggie but the problem started when we all went shopping and my dad told me to get what i wanted as he wanted to spoil me 

So we go shopping and as soon as we get there my sister insists that even she needs clothes so we both began shopping and when I'm done i go find my dad and tell him that i am ready to checkout 
At that moment he tells me that he can't pay for me as my sister is shopping too and he'll have to foot her bill
I was very upset but said that 
"" I thaught today was about me "" and he just told me to understand and that she didn't have money to shop but i do because of my part time
I was on the verge of crying and just put back the cloths and waited for them in the car 
Suddenly my mom comes in and starts lecturing me about being selfish and Inconsiderate 
I broke down completely at that point and took the bus home 
They got home and i confronted them about all the time they favoured her I'll list some here
1. I was giving my SATs back in highschool and my mom insisted that i help her clean the house for guests ,i refused and asked if she could ask my sister who was playing on her laptop but she mom refused and threw a fit and made me feel guilty the whole day for not helping out 

2. My mom was pretty strict about good grades and once even hit me because i scored less but now that my sister is a senior,my mom dosent do anything even if she fails, all my mom will say is that grades don't matter 

3.she was always given gifts for every achievement but all i got was a"" do better"" 
I scored 92% my junior year and i was asked why i couldn't score more but she got a phone for barely passing in her junior year

There have been a lot more instances and i talked to them about it but they just got angry and left early. 
Like im happy that my parents are better at parenting now but i just feel so much resentment for how they treated me

Also, a while ago she told me that because of her stay in a mental facility a couple years back, she always feels like feeling bad has to be a competition and she has to feel worse than the other person to feel „valid”. As a matter of fact, those episodes of her are way more frequent when I’m feeling bad myself. Then, when I don’t know how to help and distance myself, she will „accidentally” say things that hurt me and later on apologize, saying she didn’t mean it.

We met when we both were still in school, but I recently graduated and I’m working and living on my own. He still lives with his parents and his family is very well off. 

Last year, we exchanged gifts for the first time and at that time, I made him know I really enjoyed the gesture as 12 years ago my family back home decided never to have that tradition.
(context : back home we celebrated with my entire extended family and for some years we gifted each other things but one year, an uncle got laid off and couldn’t afford it so we decided to cancel Christmas.)

I understood, but when everything got better for everyone we just never got back to exchanging anything, not even chocolate.

This year, we started talking about giving each other presents however, it had to be before Christmas as he is going to Europe on a ski trip with his family, a trip his parents are paying for.

Things have been tight for me ever since I decided to move here but every month I have been saving to get him something nice for Christmas. Last month we talked about a budget and ended up setting the amount for 100 dollars which luckily I had already saved.

Next thing I know, he calls and asks me if it’s okay not give each other anything this year as he wants to save money (I know it sounds harsh but the reality is he can easily afford it). I felt upset because even if he wanted to give me something symbolic I would’ve appreciated, the budget was set up by him , so even if he wanted to lower it , that would’ve been okay for me. 

I understand he wants to save money for his trip but I felt neglected this Christmas because he knows how I’ve never gotten anything my entire life and I really looked forward to starting this tradition with him.

I know it sounds superficial but im disappointed he just wouldn’t put an effort into gifting me something, when he knows I’ve been saving for a while now. 

Again , I honestly wouldn’t care if it was a cheap gift, it’s just the idea that he won’t even try for me that upsets me.

Liz (29/F) and I (29/F) have been friends since high school. We have had a ""long distance friendship"" since I moved away from my hometown for school and work opportunities. Since then, I've met an amazing man and our wedding is in a few months. We currently live overseas for work, which makes wedding planning a bit stressful.  

Our wedding is about 80 people and we have a normal size bridal party. I have 4 bridesmaids, 1 is my sister and the other is the sister of my fiancé whom I am close with. The other 2 are my lifelong best friends, one whom I've known since elementary school and the other from college/adult life. There was no question who my bridesmaids would be.

This is where Liz comes in. I asked her for her address for the RSVP. She then found my wedding website (""the knot"") and absolutely exploded on me via social media to demand why she was not asked to be a bridesmaid. I tried to approach her with compassion and understanding because I know it must hurt to realize that she may be closer to me than I am to her, and I reassured her that even though our bridal party was small we would be honored if she and her husband could join as our guests. I even told her that we cut out large amounts of cousins and extended family to ensure our dear friends could be invited (we are paying for the wedding). She went nuclear and gave me the ultimatum that either I make her a bridesmaid or our friendship was over because ""I have shown my true colors."" I was honest and told her that we would not budge on our decision. She said that if we wouldn't expand, then I should simply replace my college best friend with her. The audacity!!!!! 

I firmly said no, and then she proceeded to say some terrible things about myself, my sister, and my best friends before blocking me.

Liz then tried to burn my world down by cold calling one of my bridesmaids (the best friend since college who she has never met) to say that she ""needs to know the truth about the bride"" and tried to tell her wicked lies to turn her against me. My best friend immediately shut her down and blocked her.

I've since gone no contact with Liz. I'm hurt about the volatile loss of a friendship over the bridal party. Am I in the wrong?

The kicker? She can't even come to the wedding because she bought concert tickets for that Saturday after asking me for the wedding date months ago.

After 5 or so years she decided to enter the workforce which was great as kids were getting bigger and started school. My job demanded much more time but we split taking care of our children and I kept paying all household expenses. I even paid the taxes for both of us as her work is a on a contractual basis which required her to received 1099 form and pay taxes later. She does pay for some items such as home decorations and some furnishings as well as occasional groceries. As her income grew the tax dues went larger as well, so at some point I brought up that she should pay for her share of the taxes. This was not taken lightly by her and it caused her to get argumentative telling me that she does much more work in the house than I do and I should pay the taxes. I then suggested that she contributes even a little by paying a household bill or two, but every time I touch the subject she gets very argumentative. My point of view is that is she has income she should help out with a bill or two. I am not asking for much, but it baffles me that it is such a contentious issue with her.

Longer story: My partner and I are getting married in July, next year. We picked a venue that we absolutely love, and it holds 100 people, maximum. Partner and I built up a list, talked it through, and agreed this seemed fair. She has more people attending (Final Count, 51 to 40), and agreed that the only children attending would be nieces/nephews, and children of the bride and groom's parties.

Parents come to visit the venue, to see it. They ask about the guest list, wondering why they hadn't been sent the list. The first time parents asked for the list was on October 31st. This is the first documented text/email where my dad specifically asks for the list. He believes he had asked during the summer, which I admit is entirely possible, but the first time I have any recollection of a list would be October 31st.

I forgot to include members of my family. Namely, my uncle on my mother's side, my aunt on my father's side, my great uncle on my father's side, and a friend of my mother's family that, quite frankly, I have never met. Two of these members, I straight up forgot to add; the latter two, I have absolutely no connection to. My father calls after driving home, proceeds to call my partner a liar, and deceitful, and believes that this was done intentionally on her/our part.

he's half a year older than me and is going to college in a different city, while i'm a senior in highschool. i've noticed very strange shifts in his behavior, with him becoming more angry and erratic and having no more patience left to even solve very common, simple issues in our relationship, such as lack of communication or complimenting me or being attanetive to my needs, while i am at his disposal all the time when i'm not studying. 
the arguments have gotten to the point where they're so stressful that last week on friday i had a panic attack at school. he has fallen into a deep depression, and although i understand and want to be the support system he needs, i have very serious exams coming up and i can't jinx my future just to be mentally abused and exhausted by his antics.

Regardless, I always handwash my dishes and keep them in the drying rack separate from hers.

I have been working since 2018 and been giving them money off and on. They always ended up paying me short and honestly I left it because I believed they would eventually pay me back.

It went from giving them about £50 a month to giving them majority of my uni trust fund (plus my government trust fund when I turned 18). To them paying 100 in rent and 300+ more of “borrowing money”. My dad makes at least £60k a year btw. 

They have constantly borrowed money from others and not paid the back either. But despite borrowing this money they’re living in a “luxury lifestyle” of buying takeaways and materialistic luxuries such as 1k fridges etc.

I was chucked out of home recently for the dumbest of reasons, my mum called me down for a takeaway I was in the middle of a game told her give me five and then she had a ago at me for “attitude” and that I left my brother without any medicine, despite her being able to give it to him. But that is besides the point.

They have me back my rent money but told me to go somewhere else and tried to get me to live in a hostile or with my boyfriend who I’ve been dating for only 4 months. I asked them for the rest of my money back and now they’re refusing and telling me I treated them so horrible with my attitudes over the years.

Since we moved in 2018 they have never financially supported me or supported me with education as well. (I have not borrowed any money from them until 2020). But I’m the mean time between 2020-2022 I have given the 4.7k keep in mind most of this I was a study on minimum wage. And when I would ask them to help me get down to my uni interviews as they had taken my money they refused to help me.

Also I didn’t go to uni to save up for it bc I would only get the minimum grant since my dad makes a high wage but most of my savings went straight back to them.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4812376,public,top,self,AITA for threatening to take my parents to court because I’ve had enough because I’ve had enough of their behaviour?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z12da1/aita_for_threatening_to_take_my_parents_to_court/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Then she asked “you’re native aren’t you?” I told her that Im not. She then said I might be practicing cultural appropriation and that I probably shouldn’t wear the earrings. I just said I’d keep that in mind.

Again, I am not Indigenous. I cant really decide whether or not its offensive to wear the earrings. The way I see it though is that by buying the earrings I’ve supported an Indigenous owned business. Its also not like I’m acting as if I made them myself or am trying to resell them.

I \[M25\] have a coworker \[F27\]. She's almost in 6th month of her pregnancy and she's doing really good. Our friends and I have spoke about getting her a gift card to one of the shops, where you can buy stuff for babies etc. Due to the fact, that we are all working in a corporatin, the idea went further and we have asked bigger group of people if they want to join us. Before the majority of people has came back with the answer, one of our team leaders has sent an email, that from her experience it's not a good idea, yet she'll give her something from herself. The other person (also a team leader) came to me directly and has also addressed the issue with that. The only concern of theirs was that, since she's still not in her 8th month, it's extremaly risky to give her the gift card and people will lose their money if something would happen. Basically, looking at it in very pessimistic way, without considering, that she might want to prepare earlier, before the baby will come to this world.

The reasoning behind that are superstitions in our culture. There's an very old belief, that if you will give a present to a pregnant women before the 8th month, she might lose the baby.  
Our friends and I are looking at it from more reasonable side. It's (in our opinion) better if she can use the gift card whenever she'd like to, buy something now that she needs, or wait for the baby.  
We also know, that she has already received a gift and was extremaly happy about it. We're also very aware, that she might not feel good later, and after the baby will be born, she will need some time to adjust and take care of the baby and herself. So it might be harder to give her the present later.
