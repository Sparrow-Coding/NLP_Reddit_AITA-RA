I leave my seat to smoke outside. When I come back my seat is taken and the other available stool is next to bartender's girlfriend. 

Bartender is not really my friend but we've gotten to know each other over about a year and are friendly. I've interacted with him and his girlfriend on several occasions at different establishments.

Last time I saw them together (at this same bar) I was leaving and gave her a one-armed hug and waved to him on my way out. He didn't seem to have a problem with that.

Anyway, last night I was chatting with his girlfriend for a bit while he tended the bar in front of us. We talked about their plans to move in together, about how she was excited for that to happen. I said he was a good person and a really nice guy and that she should feel good about it. Yada yada, all positive.

We also talked about how she felt weird coming to that bar because one of then other workers there is bartender's ex. I said I wouldn't worry too much about that, he really seems to like you. 

She said she appreciated me talking to her and we had another side hug while seated. Feeling like things are all smiles, so I get up again and come back to bartender calling me an asshole and saying I was being creepy to his girlfriend. 

I was like dude what? What did I do? And he was like maybe you should go home and think about it. Basically telling me to get the fuck out.

After thinking about it, I'm pretty sure I hugged like four or five other people that night, men and women. I know a lot of people there. But now I feel like a can't go back since he asked me to leave.

On Sunday at 11 AM, our national team was playing a World Cup game and I had committed to watching the game with 2 of my friends, one is A’s boyfriend and the other is A’s best friend (I’m also close to both of them and spent Friday night out with them). So now we have a table for 4 at said bar.

On Thursday night, my soccer friends said we should watch the game together- I said I’d ask A if I can get another table for 8.

I texted A at 1:45 pm Friday, she said she’d ask her manager. I reminded her at 5 pm to please let me know either way so I have an alternate. This morning at 7:30 am, still no response so I ask A again if she’d heard back. Meanwhile, the boys group chat started asking what the plan was.

A responds at 9:30 saying she forgot cuz work was busy. I said, no issue- can you let me know what is possible asap.

In the next 30 mins, one of my friends was able to get a reservation at another spot. So we decided that’s where we’ll go.

At 10:10, A let me know that she hadn’t heard back.

At 10:13, A said we should go to the bar she works at as a girl is holding a table for us, I saw the message 2 minutes later and said hey sorry it’s all good we are going elsewhere, but thank you so much for getting it.

A got mad at me, and cancelled both the table of 8 and the table of 4(with which I really didn’t have much to do)- meaning the 3 other people from that group couldn’t watch it at a bar. 

The group of 4 is saying AITA but the group of 8 are saying she should’ve let us know earlier.

I’m dealing with tantrums as best as I can and I’m not ashamed to admit I’ll choose the path of least resistance to calm her. So I was visiting my hometown in September to attend a brewery event with friends while my mom watched my daughter. While at the brewery event, my BFF surprised me with the news that she had “gotten” a gift certificate for a museum in my city for us. That it was at her house I would have to come pick it up the next day. I was touched and of course expressed my thanks, told her the next time she visited we would go and it would be great! I ended up getting wasted, didn’t go back to my moms right away and passed out for a bit. One of my other friends drew a penis on my face in dry erase marker and I totally deserved it, it was hilarious imo. So I eventually sober up and go back to my moms, when I wake the next morning, I realize my BFF is still at our other friends house and I would have to wait for her to get the gift certificate. I tried to go to the local apple orchard to kill time but it was absolute chaos and I knew she’d get overwhelmed by that so we went to the local confectionery in the next town over. I had been in communication with my BFF and told her my plan but she wanted/expected me to wait for her. I wasn’t going to wait because I know my kid. I thought she’d understand especially when I had every intention of backtracking to get the gift certificate and to say goodbye as we would be making the two hour drive home afterwards. When she realized I was at the confectionery, she went off on me. How I’m so inconsiderate and unappreciative of this gift she bought, that was first time she mentioned she paid for it but she just kept on attacking me. Now, I’ve known her since primary school and I’ve seen her come completely unhinged for some slight against her. I’ve just never been on the receiving end of it, and it reminded me of witnessing her talk down to her children, SO, father and sister over the years. I was not having it and when she tried to throw my behavior from the previous day in my face, I stopped her right there. “Isn’t that the lid calling the kettle black?” That enraged her and I just said bye because I was over her BS attitude. Then less than a week later, I attempted to call her and found myself blocked everywhere. It’s now two months later and I got a message from her on Thursday saying happy thanksgiving, I did not respond. I will be going to her daughters baby shower soon so I will see her. I’m not completely devoid of empathy and if she felt dismissed/disrespected/hurt by me, I’ll apologize but I will also tell her right then and there I don’t apologize for putting my daughter first and she’s just going to have to get over it.

At this gas station we provide full service for fueling, which for those of you who don't know, means that when you pull up to the designated lanes for full service, we come out and pump your fuel for you, wash your windows etc. 

The gas station is a part of a grocery store, so we have to go across the parking lot to grab our stock, like smokes, snacks, drinks and other things. This will be important for the story.

Now onto the main part of the story and my conundrum. 

At any given time at the gas station, there will be 2 workers, this is for safety in case of robbery, harassment or violence toward us from customers, or in the event of a medical emergency. However there will be times when an individual will have to be by themselves for a bit ( during lunch hour, breaks, and if one of us needs to go to the main store for restocking items ) When this happens we close off the full serve lanes so we don't have to be two places at once.

Sound reasonable? I thought so but recently there has been an influx of people coming in to tell me exactly how they feel about it, which usually isn't very kind. In particular the elderly population that lives in my town.

So here is where I need you all to tell me if I'm an asshole. There are a lot of elderly that struggle in the cold here, which is our busy season. So we have a lot of people who are uncomfortable in the cold asking for help, even when full serve is closed. I understand that it might be more difficult but I am not paid to do two peoples jobs at the same time, we also have smokes and lottery tickets unlocked I can't leave unattended. 

I hear a lot of things from friends and family, as well as the elderly folks coming in that I am just being lazy, entitled, or cruel for making them pump their own fuel. I understand that it may be difficult but i make minimum wage, it isn't worth the risk of having things stolen from the store, and i frankly don't think I get paid enough to do that.

I expected him to ignore my birthday, which he did (daughter is away at college so she isn't here to coordinate anything) and not even a card from him. I decided to continue on with my plan.

He claims he likes to cook and we eat different foods most of the time. I have to ask him to do things like clean his bedside table which will have cans, bottles, cups, rubbish, same with his desk, I have to ask him to put the clothes I have cleaned away and ask him to take dirty clothes from wherever he’s hung them (like on a curtain pole) and put them in the basket. If he cooks he doesn’t wash his hands and gets angry if I ask him to. He makes a lot of mess and most of the time I spend cleaning is after him. Example four nights ago when he last drank beer he cooked sausages, as he doesn’t wash his hands often he proceeded to touch everything in the kitchen with greasy sausage hands, door knobs,  keys etc. and just leaves a half eaten plate of smelly sausage on the side for me to tidy.

We have fallen out about alcohol many times as he is miserable if he drinks and he doesn’t agree with me at all, but I feel he really changes almost as soon as he has had one beer. He has lied to me on numerous occasions how much alcohol he has consumed. I’ve found empty cans in our car; our flowerbeds outside the house because he’s dumped them on the way through the door, seen multiple bottles of beer in our bins despite him swearing on everything he’s “only had one”. He’s not the most conscious person any day of the week but once he’s drunk alcohol he is horrible &amp; selfish. This evening after having two beers he came to bed with a curry, despite knowing because I’ve told him all week that my sense of smell is super heightened because I’m in the early stages of pregnancy and everything smells so strong. I’ve spent most of this week in bed and the only tasks I have asked him to do are go to the supermarket and to make me two sandwiches. Ive done the housework as normal during the periods I’m not heaving or needing to lie down. I’m on fertility drugs so my hormones levels are really high. 

Tonight He sat on the bed loudly eating and slurping and asked me “are you texting your mate slagging me off?” when I was replying to an unrelated message from my dad. I said no but if I was I would be saying how you’re eating curry in bed. Instead of saying oh you know what fair enough, he decides all I do is moan and complain and it’s “his house” so he will do what he wants to. He proceeds to eat the curry louder and sloppier. He’s shouted at me &amp; told me to go sleep at my parents house which he knows I cant do as there is no bed for me to sleep on.

Once I started working, my dad started charging me $150 a month for rent to help pay for rent, groceries, whatever.

Two days later, the sink is full of dishes again.

Me, not thinking about that at the time, asked my dad if I could hang out with a close friend who would be back in town for a while. He had no issues with it. We stayed out pretty late so I went right to sleep when I got home. 

I woke up this morning, took a shower, and got ready for work, and my dad flipped out about the dishes. He said that since he let me hang out with my friend, it was ""a kick in the balls"" that the dishes weren't done. He said that he's done driving me to work. He said that im the only one in the house that will help him and that he's sick of me ""doing nothing"". He also said that if I didn't want to do anything for him, that he'd be raising my rent to $300 a month.

The rest of the car ride to work was silent, but it got me thinking. Would I be an asshole if I followed up with him on that offer or asked to get it in writing?

The mother runs a blog updating on the dad's progress and how much everyone in their family has had to step up and help take care. Their daughter (22F) has particularly been a superhero in caretaking, getting a job to help support, cooking, cleaning and so much more.

All that to say, the other night, my (59M) daughter (20F) came to me at 9pm, asking if I could drive her and her brother to a donut shop they wanted to try downtown, which is 30 minutes from our house. I was still up yet very tired, but as a father, you want to give your kids what they want, so I agreed anyway. 

It was a place we hadn't been before in some tucked-away spot deep in the city, so directions were a nightmare, not to mention it was night. I was already stressed out, and then I accidentally hit a curb, which made everything spill out. I asked my daughter why are we out here in the middle of the night and how childish it was for her to ask to do this at night. 

She said I agreed to take us and thought I wanted the donuts too, and her dismissiveness made me even more upset, and that's when I compared her to the daughter from the family we know, and how mature and strong she's had to be, and I said I could never imagine my daughter stepping up like she has if we ever met tragedy. Admittedly, I was very frustrated and angry, but even then, I still went to the shop and got the donuts (and my daughter was now suddenly too upset to eat and never touched them, letting the rest of the family eat them).

We raised her together from the time she was born but she was always *his* dog, &amp; she has been a huge ‘security blanket’ for me since he passed away. When I miss him, I hug her &amp; cry. 

Needless to say, I was devastated when she went missing. I bawled myself to sleep every night for over a week. I hiked dangerous terrain, searching high and low for my beloved dog. By day 7, everyone was telling me to give up, that she was deceased &amp; I needed to move on. I desperately wanted to find her body so that I could bury her with my deceased partner’s ashes, but again was told I needed to give up &amp; let it go. It reopened a lot of my grief and feelings of loss. I felt like I had let my partner down. The last two nights she was missing, instead of calling for her (because everyone thought I was being foolish/shamed me for having hope), I went outside &amp; looked at the stars and ‘talked’ to him — I begged to see her again, dead or alive, so I could bury his ashes with her.

It is truly a miracle that she showed up 10 days after she went missing. We live on a big farm - there were nights the temperature was in the single digits. Deer hunters everywhere. Coyotes and other predators.

Aside from losing 20 lbs, the most serious of her injuries is a dislocated knee, which she will need surgery for. 

Here is where I need advice:

I started dating someone earlier this year (25m). They moved in with me at the beginning of September after being long distance since late Feb/early march 2022

When my dog went missing, I had to beg him to help me look. The first day she went missing, he left me alone to deal with everything. I sat in my room and bawled while he sat in the living room for hours with my dad and brother - drinking beer &amp;hanging out. The second day she was missing, he told me he was going to leave work early and come help me but instead, left work early &amp; drove to the closest town to go to the bank (around noon) and didn’t show up at the house until it was already nighttime - thus, impossible to search for her. I was really upset because the first 48 hours are crucial - I was so worried she was injured out in the forest. 

I ended up doing most of the searching on foot by myself but he did help me a couple of days — albeit, he drove a side by side so fast through the woods that I couldn’t even make out shapes or colors of our surroundings. 

My dog showed up all by herself around 5 PM on November 23rd (the day before thanksgiving). My dad went on his nightly walk &amp; my dog just showed up, started walking with him, &amp; he didn’t even notice it was her until they were back at the house. My dad cried &amp; said it was a miracle. We were emotional.

Maybe just need someone to talk me through my emotions. I (31f) and my ex (28m) we're together for 7 years. We have a young daughter. 

I will be ear the timing of this definitely puts me in the wrong, but I am wondering if on the whole I am a jerk or if my emotions are a factor. 

I didn't have a lot of dating experience before meeting him. And growing up in a fairly conservative Christian house had an impact. My parents weren't the ""God hates the gays"" sort but there was definitely some mild homophobia and heteronormative themes in my home. I spent a long time in denial. 

Some time after my daughter was born I realized that I would be happier if I was dating a woman. My ex is generally a great guy and a lot of our relationship issues boil down to him wanting to be loved the way he loved. Obviously I couldn't give him that. I wanted to. I stayed with him after realizing I was gay. I can't entirely explain my logic, but even still, I do wish I could have loved him the way he loved me. I don't know if I can ever find that kind of love again. But I knew if he ever left I would date women. 

Here's where the AH part might begin. He had a close family member died and left state. I admit I was emotionally absent for quite a while at this point. And definitely a bad time for coming out. He and I had always had a pretty trusting relationship. I knew his phone/ social media passwords and he knew mine, but as far as I knew neither of us checked messages. I checked his messages and found he was hanging out with an ex girlfriend while in town. At this point I hoped he was cheating. I didn't hate him or resent our relationship but I wanted to date women and I would never cheat on him. Being gay isn't an excuse to cheat. When I asked him who he was hanging out with, he was honest. This suggests to me this was them innocently catching up. 

He came back and I waited. Probably not long enough. It was maybe a month. I really feel like a monster for the timing of this and would do anything to change it. However I was caught in my own feelings. Here is where I think I made a second mistake. I asked for an open relationship rather than ending things. I told him he could see other women, if I could as well. He was so hurt by this. We fought. This ended up with me telling him, Im really not into men. 

He's not a saint in this, he said hurtful things. I tried to let him have space for his emotions, but ai couldn't always take the way he spoke to me. I ended up coming out to my family before I was ready to try to make peace. It didn't help. 

This was a few months back. I miss having him as my friend. I know he needs time. But he tells me he misses my friendship too. But we're not ok. I am ready to date. But I know it's going to hurt him.

I am single and my neighbors husband is out of town for a couple weeks for work so she thought it would be fun to take a day trip to show her around the area. Great! She wanted to start at the Grand Canyon. Not great. Then she thought it would be nice to pop over to Las Vegas for lunch. Oh.. Oh no.. 

I tried to tell her that she had picked places that are much farther apart than she thinks but she insisted it couldn't be that bad. So I pulled up Google maps and showed her just how far we were talking about. That if we drove from here to the Grand Canyon it would be 7 hours if we never stopped for food or gas, then 4 hours from the Grand Canyon to Las Vegas, and that's not even counting the drive home. Its not an easy fun day trip.

Child is 4 years old. We were together for 4.5 years, then split. Relationship started great then eventually devolved into arguing, being petty &amp; all the other stuff that typically destroys relationships after a while. We were living together virtually the entire time &amp; started dating in our early 20’s, so the relationship more or less felt like a marriage (technically we were common law married for quite some time according to the laws of a state we were in). 

We have a joint custody arrangement (50/50 everything; no child support). Our child isn’t yet in school &amp; there’s no pressing matters we really need to discuss yet. We’ve tried “being friends”, getting back together, hating each other, communicating through 3rd parties etc., and everything seems to crash &amp; burn. 

I don’t hate my child’s mother. The logical, rational adult part of my mind tells me we’re both still dealing w the breakup &amp; the fact we never really got to truly separate &amp; “move on” from each other the way couples typically do when they split has made things harder. We both struggle w respecting boundaries. 

I feel like the solution is to not care about her. At all. Now when I say “not care”, I don’t mean disrespect or treat with disregard. I just mean don’t care. Like the same way you don’t care about me. Sure, you may be reading &amp; forming an opinion, but you don’t *care* about me or what I’m going to do next / how I handle this situation. 

We already have an arrangement to exchange our daughter - time &amp; place determined, so it’s not like we need to text about that. We both have our own places to live &amp; resources / support to ensure we’re fine. My child’s mother in specific has a huge family ready to help her if need be. Obviously if something catastrophic happened I’d reach out. But apart from that, no. 

I don’t plan on this being forever because it can’t be. But I just need a fucking break. Or like a way to mentally ween myself off from her so I can get to a place where I can coparent without caring about all the extra little stuff that distracts &amp; leads to arguments. Sure one could say, “Just ignore it” or the litany of other potential solutions but I’ve tried those and I KNOW me and I KNOW this will work. I came up w the idea because she mentioned something to me about having sex w another guy and it hurt + irritated me (that was the intention).

Little did I know that when my mother picked me up from the airport, my ex-stepfather (my mother was married to this man and divorced years ago, and are now back together) was there in the car as a ""surprise"" from my mother.

A little context for this man though. He made my life a living hell growing up and was very controlling of me and my brother. He would not be supportive of anything my brother and I did and would gaslight us consistently. My mother is lonely where she lives now, and she really wanted someone to be with which is why they amended and got back together, but did not remarry. 

So, Friday, I had to work on some crucial work-related things that came up out of nowhere, and I was on my laptop in my room finishing those things up. My mother called me to dinner and I asked her to give me a few minutes because I needed to finish my train of thought with this email I was sending. My mother's boyfriend then opened the door and said it's time to eat *now* and I asked him to give me a few minutes. He then proceeded to turn off my laptop and I stopped him to the point where it didn't just shut down automatically, but it still shutdown and I lost my email I was typing up along with some other work files that were still open (I was able to salvage a little bit of it).

He and I got into a verbal altercation and I said that he doesn't control me anymore and that he is completely out of line for shutting down my laptop, to which he said this is his and my mother's household and it's their rules. I got so irritated to the point where I said to the both of them that I would be changing my flight to later today and that once I am treated like I am an adult and not a teenager, I would come back for Christmas, so that's exactly what I did. I got a later flight, Ubered there, and left for home early.

I've been doing some self-care things the past two days to take my mind off of what happened because my mother was so upset when I left early. But, instead of thoroughly enjoying my time off, I was left with the ""surprise"" of my mother's boyfriend being there, and still controlling me even eight years after he and my mother divorced.

My mom was diagnosed 4 years ago with stage 4 cancer and I told him that if he tells me more I would cry. I encouraged him to continue and as he shared with me tears just started streaming down my face and he was surprised but hugged me and wiped them away.

Later that night though him and his friend could not stop talking about sex and their experiences. It was a total turn off. I could tell he was very interested in that, but I am a virgin and plan on waiting until marriage.

From an early age I was told how I was a bigger unwanted pregnancy than my sister (3 years older than me for context) when they had her they were 18 but really exited when they found out. However my dad cheated on my bio mum when she was 5 months pregnant with my sister and she was shattered. However she knew with them being so young she couldn’t financially support her and my sister so she forgave him even though there relationship was at rock bottom. Than my bio mum got pregnant with me and from as early as I can remember my parents were constantly  yelling and arguing until they eventually broke up when I was about 3. From then my dad would always want to see my sister but never me and my mum would continue to tell me how she would have to force him to see me which I’m not gonna lie made me feel really shitty about myself. 

When I got older it got better but my dad would continue to tell me how he always gives us stuff when I didn’t even have an outfit at his house and he payed a lot under the child support he was suppose to. So I felt useless my entire life because of my dad not wanting me and as he told me i was useless every time I saw him. 

Now my stepdad. He had doubelstandas that he held towards only me (I have two stepbrothers aswell as my older sister) and I could clearly see how different I was treated. Even after all the talks we had about boundaries he ignored them and carried on.

Now I’m getting married in a month And I told my grandad he could walk me down the aisle and he cried with joy. Now this is where I may be the ah. My mum found out and asked why my dad or stepdad isn’t doing it and I simply said “I’m not having someone I don’t feel comfortable around walk me down the aisle” she blue up at me saying how it’s disrespectful to say something like that and if I didn’t ask one of them and tell my grandad he couldn’t she wouldn’t go to the wedding. She told my dad and stepdad and they both went mad and now I don’t know what to do my grandparents and siblings minus my step brothers say I’m not the ah but now I’m not sure

I became somewhat close with her friends and knew these people for almost a year. I would hangout with these people every weekend but under circumstances I wasn't happy with. All that they would ever do is go out, get drunk and do a bunch of cocaine every week. This was part of the reason I broke up with this girl because I didn't want to live that kind of life.
Aside from that, I found out after I ended things with her that she had sex with one of the guys from that group behind my back over the summer. This guy was my friend for longer than the rest of the group, I was friends with him for over 2 years. All of her friends knew and no one ever said anything to me about it. I asked her multiple times if she had slept with anyone and she always denied that she did, and she would ask me the same but I truthfully did not, even in that weird part in our relationship where we were seeing each other but not officially dating.
After I found out about this, I was furious and I cut off contact with pretty much everyone involved because I took this as a major betrayal. Every time I would hang out with these people they would tell me how much they like me and that they love me and shit like that. I was really hurt by this because I believe that a true friend would've told me the truth, even if it hurts. I still see these people whenever I go out on weekends and we pretty much ignore each other as if we were never friends and on top of that, a rumour was spreading in that group claiming that I cheated on this girl when we were together which never happened. Now these people believe I screwed this girl over and I am the bad guy in this situation. I want nothing to do with any of these people anymore because no one asked me if this actually happened or not, no one apologized to me either. Right after I found out, I saw this group of people at a bar and they tried to say hi to me and act like nothing happened but I just ignored them.
Loyalty is something I value a lot in friendships and relationships and I feel like I was completely betrayed by these people, and now I know they are making shit up behind my back too. I truly cared about this girl and I know that a big conflict in this issue was the fact that we were not actually dating when this all happened, but we had dated previously and were in that talking stage again.

My bf works a physically demanding job (not construction or anything, he just has to be on his feet and walking for 8 hours a day.) needless to say, he is tired. I understand. I work from home 8-5. However my body gets very, very stiff from sitting and not doing physical activity so I don't just get tired, I am aching all over. I mostly just run around the house getting things done before I have to go to sleep. It doesn't help that we work opposite schedules right now.  We don't have kids and don't want them. 

Earlier this week my bf suggested we go and do laundry after the work day yesterday. It's my weekend so I agreed. We have to go out to do it. I said ok but knew he'd be tired. I asked him, ""are you sure?"" He was like yes. Alright, so when I picked him up from work at 8:30 pm we went straight to the laundromat. We had 2 pretty big piles of clothes, it was a lot to do for one person, honestly. 

Afterwards, it was time to fold and we agreed we'd do it at the house. So we get home, and he tells me he needs to rest and that he'll help me later. I said ok but that I'm tired too, and start to fold. He didn't like this. He takes a shower and then plops on the bed. I understand he's tired so I give him some time. 

I later tell him, in a loving way, ""how about we divide the clothes in 2 piles? That way the huge pile is split in half and it's easier for both of us!"" He agreed (as in verbally gave me a seemingly enthusiastic yes) and then said he'll do his half when he can. I agreed, and left him alone. 

A few minutes later he has an attitude about it, is fussy folding the clothes and hardly speaks to me the rest of the night. Finally when we're in bed, and still silent (i am too honestly) I ask him if there is anything he would've wanted me to do differently? He literally says ""mmm no"" 

I then looked at him as if knowing there was more, and there was. and he told me ""I didn't like how you said 'let's split the pile in two' because I feel like you said it so that we would each have the same equal amount of clothes.""  I then said ""uh yes?"" He said ""well I didn't like it because I feel like you thought I wasnt going to help at all. And you know I'm not like that. It's not a bad thing that you said it, I just wouldn't have done it. I also don't like the fact that you said ""I'm tired too"" as if trying to be in the same position as me."" 

So I asked him what he would've done differently, his response was ""if you tell me you're tired I'll let you rest and I'll finish the pile."" Seems insane bc I would never let him do that by himself.

AITA (14M) for lashing out at my mother? (45F)

So this happened a couple hours ago, and I’m currently typing this as my parents are in a different room.

I was on my phone, playing my games in the kitchen. My mam (mother) asked me to get a few things for her in the storage room upstairs. Baubles (ornaments), cones (pine cones but she either didn’t say specifically pine cones or i forgot) and berries (fake ones). I asked, “Where are they?” (In the storage room) She said, “one of the boxes.”

So I go upstairs, and look. I cant find them and i yell for her and ask, “Wait, where?” In response, “in of the boxes!”

So I look, I really did. And I couldn’t find them. In one of the boxes there was cones. Not pine cones, just tinsel cones (lil Christmas tree). I call for her again, showing her the cones and asking if these are the cones.

She gets annoyed, and does that floppy hand thing and says, “Forget it just forget it.” So I do, go downstairs.

 (I’m forgetful, so this is part is based on what I remember. It may not be in chronological order, but it definitely happened)

I go into the kitchen, and she’s standing there. She starts saying how Im on my phone too much and it’s done stuff to my brain and all. She tells me that I no longer can go on the phone for the rest of the night (she forgot).

She then walks over to me trying to be (jokingly) intimidating. She whispers, “I’ll whip your skinny ass.” She meant it as a joke, but she’s getting really close to me and i dont like that.

I move away, repeatedly saying stop. 5 times at least, if not more. So I keep walking away from her around the kitchen until she gets closer to me (she was gently me at the time) and i sort of move her off me and she stops. I go sit down at the table, and open my copy’s and stuff to study. I’m done.

She comes over to me and says in a low voice: (this i really dont remember too well) “You are being so disrespectful to me. The way you have been treating me lately is disrespectful.” Something similar to that.

I opened my mouth to argue, but I just don’t do anything and look down at my books. After probably 3-4 mins, she tells my dad who was in the other room of what I did. He calls me in as my mother leaves the room, and he tells me that I’m bigger and stronger than her. And how I need to remember that.

After a while of me studying, she tries to make amends by trying to get me to laugh. I do laugh, but I’m not forgiving her. Not today.

TL;DR I “moved” my mother after she was getting too close to me, and now she’s pissed.

She made okay money, but finances could be very stressful for her. She always had a soft spot for my sister (she chose a field similar to hers, and is very charismatic - dancer, student council pres, etc.) while I'm the more shy daughter.

In 2017 following graduation, I moved to a major city for a job opportunity that didn't pay well ($30K) but got my foot in the door. My apartment was in a rough borough because it was all I could afford between my car, student loans, and salary. I went for a run after work one day (6pm and still light outside) and as I ran down a sidewalk, two boys in their late teens crossed the street from afar to walk towards my direction. I felt slightly uneasy, but ignored it and thought it would be rude/awkward to cross the street in response, so I picked up my pace and kept running.

As we passed each other, I moved to the far left of the sidewalk to make room until one of them suddenly grabbed my arm and whipped me violently towards them. They sandwiched me between them and demanded I hand over ""whatever I got"" while one of them kept flashing a gun in his waistband at me. It felt like forever. I gave them my iPhone, debit card, and headphones. I was terrified they would drag me to an ATM or shoot me and started sobbing, but fortunately they ran off. $215 was spent on my debit card at a local bodega before I could report it, but that and buying a new phone was a huge burden at the time.

I know muggings happen, but it weirdly sort of messed me up? I moved in far too soon with my toxic boyfriend at the time just to get out of the neighborhood and split rent, and to this day I have panic attacks when I see groups of teenage boys. It didn't occur to me to ask my mom for help or a loan to get a safer living situation (or a new phone post mugging). I just figured I'm a grown adult now and we don't do that.

Flash forward 2022 - my sister let it slip my mom helps with her and her husband's rent. She also contributed $60K to their wedding at a prestigious venue when they were still grad students in 2019. I knew that one already, but finding out my sister is still receiving ""help"" spiraled me for some reason and I lashed out when slightly drunk after Thanksgiving. My mom quipped she can ""barely afford her mortgage"" and I started crying. I asked why my sister's wedding was worthy of her funds but not my safety when I was 22, accused her of making it ""ridiculously obvious"" she prefers my sister, and I just kept asking what I did to make her ""hate me"". She was also buzzed and got aggressive, saying the wedding and mugging were both ""years ago"", asking when I'd get over it now that I make ""more money than her"", and saying every mother-child relationship is different so it's ridiculous to compare siblings... I left her house, flew back home and we haven't spoken. I feel like SUCH an asshole/brat, but I also don't feel like being the one to apologize and sort of doubt she will either.

Yesterday, I approached one of the people who looked like they had a leadership role in the group. I let her know that though we support community members using our space, we couldn’t have so many of our tables in use for so long and that it seemed like the meetup might be a better fit for a community room at the library nearby. She looked hurt. The group ended up leaving a few minutes later. 

One of my assistant managers approached me this morning and said I shouldn’t have asked the knitters to find a different space because they’re basically sweet old ladies — so now I feel like a jerk.

I (25F) have a group of girl friends (23-25F) I’ve known since college who I used to be incredibly close with. But lately things have been kind of strained between me and the other members. I’ve begun to feel like I’m on the outskirts of the group in comparison to the others, who regularly respond and react to each other’s posts and hang out with each other frequently. I on the other hand am lucky if I get a response back from any of them after I message them. This has led to a couple of fights in the past where I have expressed how I’ve felt and they’ve grown defensive and ganged up on me, claiming I’ve attacked their character and overreacted. In retrospect, it always felt like I had to be the one to apologize for my own feelings while i very rarely got an apology for being made to feel excluded.

Despite our disagreements, I still care for these girls. With Christmas coming up, I thought it might be a good way to reconnect. I bought everyone gifts - nothing expensive, clothing I knew they would like based on their interests. Afterwards, I reached out in the group chat asking if anyone would be interested in a December get-together, expressing how much I missed everyone and how I would love to catch up and give everyone their gifts. Early, I know, but a lot of us have very busy work schedules and I figured asking this far in advance would give everyone time to plan accordingly. Almost everyone in the group saw it but didn’t respond. I chalked that up to them being busy and waited. Still no response the rest of the day. Not even a “no I can’t” or a “busy now, I’ll respond later”

I was incredibly hurt. I remember calling my boyfriend crying, and he suggested they could’ve just forgotten or even didn’t receive the message at all due to a glitch and suggested I send another message just following up the next day. So I did, even trying to turn it into a little bit of a joke by putting a meme of a confused John Travolta with a little Santa hat on. 

Same lack of response. And the hurtful cherry on top was I could actively see them joking and posting in another one of our larger group chats.

At this point, I was pissed in addition to being hurt and while I really wanted to post a massive message expressing my anger and calling them all out, I knew it wouldn’t do any good in the long run. So. Next day comes, I pack up all their gifts and head over to my local nonprofit. Everything’s now going towards their Christmas drive for those who need it. 

A few days after that, I finally see one of the girls has @‘d me, asking what gifts I got them in a joint manner. I respond that since it didn’t seem like we were doing a Christmas party this year, I brought the clothes to a charity drive instead.

I immediately got kicked from the group chat. One of the girls reached out to me, saying I was an AH and that this was why they didn’t invite me to anything.

I had a job as a school tutor, where I got to help a group of students with their homework right after their school time, but I got fired from it a month ago. I told my mother about it and I asked her not to say anything to my stepfather, as I knew he would immediately try to talk and basically harass me about it, which doesn’t help anybody really. He even told me he didn’t care about my job before, so I didn’t see any reason to tell him anything about it.

However, he noticed me not really going to work anymore, and he started asking questions. I told him that I just got fed up with the job and quit, but he seemed not to believe me and started to pressure my mother for answers - and apparently she told him I got fired. To her credit, she did tell him that I have my reasons for not telling him and that he should leave me alone, then maybe at some point I'd tell him myself.

I had quite the suspicions my mother told him already, as there is a habit in this house of when someone tells basically anything, secret or not, to another person, the entire family and household eventually becomes aware of it -something that made me very uneasy with the idea of opening up to people about my problems- but I thought “Maybe it’s just me” and that I should trust my mom a bit more with my secrets and whatnot.

Yesterday, he came to me while I was busy playing a game and listening to a friend's broadcast and started asking me what’s the real reason why I don't work anymore, while offhand scolding me and insisting that we should communicate more together in cases like this. Basically, he tried to force the information out of me while knowing it already from someone else, and it solidified the idea that I can't say anything even to my mother who was kinda my last resort.

I talked to my mom about this, and she told me that when he noticed I didn't work anymore, he didn't believe me when I told him I quit, and started asking her directly. The situation seemingly escalated to a point where she **had** to tell him, otherwise their argument was clearly never gonna end. She did however make a point that she tried to retain the information from him for as long as she could. 

Her conclusion was that I’m the only responsible party here since he feels hurt that I don’t talk to him about my everyday problems, so my logical answer was to tell her I’m not the one bugging her about why my stepdad can’t get a job (he does work, admittedly, but only every now and then) and that you shouldn’t be prying information out of a third party anyways.

Closer to the day, I checked and noticed hotels were a bit out of my price range in that area because it was Thanksgiving weekend, so I called my friend Linda and asked if I could stay at their place. They had offered in the past but I rejected, to be polite, since I thought I’d have a hotel. I told them I’d be coming in at 4 AM to make it in time for the interview, and so I wouldn’t have to drive in the middle of heavy traffic. Linda’s boyfriend Charlie wasn’t into the idea of me staying, because we got in a fight a few weeks back and he thinks I only keep contact for job help. My girlfriend made us an hour late to leaving, but then two hours into the drive my car starts smoking. I call Linda, and she tells me to pull over and turn off the car. Even when I pull over and turn off the car though, the smoke is still pouring out of my hood. The gasket overheated and blew. I thought I bought a lemon, but I remembered the guy I bought the car from two weeks ago had told me to put coolant in and I had forgotten. We were on a highway with a broken car in the middle of nowhere at 2 am, and trying to figure out how to proceed. I asked Charlie over the phone if he can come drive and get us, and he said he can’t since they have work tomorrow morning (but I do too). There were no nearby Ubers when I checked the app, so we called the police to maybe get coolant for the car. The police offered to drive us somewhere safe, but my girlfriend had brought an expensive mermaid tail for swimming in the beach once we got to our location and she was embarrassed and didn’t want to take it out of the trunk.

Me and my partner and our daughter live somewhere where both our families have slowly moved away from. We each basically only have one household of family members here each now, but I hardly see mine so we really only have theirs, which is one of their siblings and that siblings family. My partner had another sibling who used to live near us (and their family of 7) and  also their dad both move about 7 hours away. Separately but to the same state. 

The dad basically chases that sibling wherever they’re going. That person lived in that state without the dad for about 4 months and he was driving to see them every other weekend. While we lived right down the road and he hardly ever talked to us. 

When he left he pulled a whole show acting all sad and begging us to come down at the start of 2023 to see them all, while also making comments that made it crystal clear he was leaving because he didn’t give a shit about us as much. Like no joke, he pretty much said that to us, the sibling still near us and our kids. Stupidly we agreed to start planning a trip to see them. The dad also said he wouldn’t be driving to see us at all for at least a year or so… even though he was driving to see the other sibling every other week. 

However my partner now wants to go see differently family that they haven’t seen in almost ten years, and that I and our kids have never met. This family lives about 15 hours from us, and despite not meeting them I have a good relationship with them. It’s essentially my partners mom, grandparents, one of his siblings that chose to stay with their mom etc. they’re hardworking people and there are things that have set them back from coming to us, like legitimate things that are just because well…. Life. However they’re constantly wanting to see us and my partner thinks it would be the better idea at this point. Not to mention, some of these family members are old and we aren’t sure how long they’ll be around.

She is a highschool professor and is working on her PHD to teach at university.

Lili was/is the perfect child, always did good in school, in extracular activities, she did everything perfectly. I am the opposite, never liked school and I never got along well with my parents. They never really knew how to deal with me, especially after Lili. I grew up with them telling me that I had to be more like her and comparing us. 

When I was 15, in my first year of highschool it got bad and I got nearly expelled. I was forced to go to an university forum where I met Jay.

Jay was the opposite of me. He was from an international school and was here because he wanted to know the processus of admissions for his dream uni.

Against all odds we became best friends. Being friend with him helped me a lot. I found a new way of studying, met new people…

We were always together and we went to each other’s families for holidays. Every year he came with me abroad to my grandparent’s house and his family always included me in their holidays. 

I want to add that his family are pretty wealthy. Like my family is not poor or anything, we are more middle class but when i went with them they were aways the one paying for me. 

However I want to be clear that I am not friend with him because of his family money. But it is important for later.

Last year was the last year of HS and against all odds I was accepted at uni to study engineering. I know that without Jay and his family I wouldn’t have been abble to do it. 

Jay was accepted to his dream university in his home country (we live in Europe) and he left in september. I only saw him once since and I am currently applying to a scholarship to go study near him and his parents are helping me with all the papers. In the meantime I still live with my parents.

Last week Jay’s parents called to tell me that they wanted to invite us to a week vacation in february as a gift for how well we did this year. The know that it was my dream to go to a winter vacation so they rented a winter cabin in Switzerland. It’s beautiful. I told my parents about it and I said yes.

The issue started this week end. Lili came over to eat for a family dinner and my parents told her about the vacation, I was really happy about it so I showed them the pictures. Lili got really quiet and said ok. 

After she left my parents came to me and told me that they talked to Lili and they all felt like it wasn’t fair for me to enjoy and go on such nice vacation when Lili can’t. That Lili had always been a model kid growing up and that it wasn’t fair for her to not have the same opportunity when she deserved it. I didn’t know what to say but they told me to think about it and how it was disrespectful of me towards her, them and Jay’s family to accept to go.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4830580,public,top,self,AITA for accepting to go on a dream vacation when my family can’t ?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6817c/aita_for_accepting_to_go_on_a_dream_vacation_when/,all_ads,6,,,,

She has a 5 year old son (I'll call him Ben) from her previous relationship with a guy I'll call Kevin- however I don't consider Ben my son as I don't actively look after him much and have no ties. They don't have a custody agreement, but Lisa looks after him majority of the time since she doesn't work and Kevin does (he takes Ben on weekends). However since Kevin is caring for his ill mother, Lisa has started to look after him more. I have no issue, but she tends to act like I don't exist, always taking him out and schooling, barely even talking. I know she's a mother and I respect that - but sometimes I feel like I don't exist.
Recently it was Ben's birthday and he loves BK so we went there for his celebration. After finishing our (mediocre) food, Lisa screamed happy birthday, so loud it could have caused an earthquake - and for me that's a huge issue. I'm sensitive to sound and while I am more tolerant to louder sounds, it is still a struggle. By doing that, she has probably reversed a lot of progress - 3 MONTHS (I wasn't treated as a child as parents are f**kers.)
When we got home, I was pissed. My ears were ringing like 5000 church bells and when Lisa asked why I wasn't talking, I said angrily it was her screaming happy birthday. I asked her why she would do that, and she trembled, ""I forgot"". 
Complete lie. I gave her an angry glare, and that made her cave and say, ""Ok, I did it cuz Ben's dad is away and he needs cheering up"" and that ""I'm sorry for you ears but it's only a minor sacrifice""

I was furious (to put it lightly).

I met him around May timeframe for our upcoming Pilot training. (It's very intense and high stress)

I talk to ""Mark"" about becoming roommates he tells me that he may get married so they can live together. (She is military so for her to move here they have to be married) We dismiss the idea.

A month or so pass and he says that he will wait until after training. We move in at the end of July. Sept. Mark begins to talk about get married. I ask him what the house plan is. He says he will move out and leave me with the house if I'd like to which I tell him he and his wife can keep the house because it's too big for me. He agrees.

They get married beginning of Oct. I call our landlord and ask him can if they assume the lease...he agrees.

A week passes and I tell him I'm going to start looking because housing is scarce here. You need to get ahead of these things. He gets upset.

I say that it's best to go ahead and move because we had not started flying and were still in academic phase of training. He wants me to wait until his wife moves here and to move out during the peak of training.

A few weeks pass the apartment says the have a unit Nov 9th. The I tell him my plans to move and that I will pay Nov rent. At this point his wife does NOT have orders to our base yet (I didn't know how joint spouse works but turns out HE APPLIED for it so it was LIKELY she would move here according to my leadership)

Mark gets irate.... I ask him if he's upset. He says ""Don't f\*cking talk to me right now"" and slams the door in my face. This upsets me and tell him ""You need to be an adult and take responsibility for your actions"" to which he replies ""what does that mean, you're the one moving out"" Then proceeds to say ""I could at least be a decent human being and give him some time to figure things out""

Things cool down &amp; he asks me to pay Dec rent to help him out until his wife moves here or not. To which I agree. He says ""well I guess things are going to be real f\*cking awkward around here for the next few weeks""

I don't feel comfortable so I leave &amp; couch surf until I find a house. (Worst case his wife would move here in March which would leave him $1200 out of pocket for rent where as I'm paying $1800 for the two months I'm not there)

I thought things were done and that he and his wife would stay at the house. NO. He MOVES out of the house to a house on base. Leaving us on the hook for rent until the house is rented. He texts me last week asking if I'd be willing to pay FOUR months advance rent to get out of our lease. I ask him why he moved out and he says ""it's better for my wife when I leave""

As of right now I'm in this almost $3000 plus time and stress. Along with being on the hook for more rent.

It was fine at first, but lately it’s been getting to the point where he brings his gf over quite often which I don’t mind because she and I have been really good friends. It’s just that they eat take out, to go, and DoorDash/UberEats all the time. The refrigerator is all of their food and leftovers and they never threw it out and it started to smell. The only thing of mine in frozen foods os a box of breakfast sandwiches. I’m the refrigerator it’s things like things I know I’ll consume like eggs, cheese, and a pack of tweas. I’m taking up one drawer and a spot for my tweas and a gallon of apple juice out of two drawers, three shelves, and all the storage in the door. Mainly because I know if I buy stuff there’s no room because they never eat their leftovers. 

Recently, they got really mad at me because they say I never clean out the refrigerator or help keep it clean and it stinks. So they decided to mad clean it and throw out my eggs, (which I know weren’t the issue I bought them the week before and had used two for breakfast), and my apple juice which was brand new and unopened claiming that those two were the things that were stinking. When I looked into the fridge all their leftovers were gone and it smelled fine. I was planning on bringing it up on the weekend so they could go through their stuff on a non school day. And I could have probably helped them if they asked but it was their stuff not mine and I didn’t want to just throw their stuff away. But they just did it while I was at class for 5 hours and never said anything to me until I got the text saying it was my fault. I responded with “okay sorry I can help next time but I think it was probably all the leftovers. I don’t think my eggs and apple juice were the problem I bought them a week ago? Plus I don’t have room to buy lots of foods, I can keep track of the few items I have and if they’re bad. You could have asked before you threw it away.” And they got a little hissy at me and said I was blaming them entirely and not taking any responsibility.

However, we recently had a conversation about tattoos I am planning on getting next week and he began asking about placement and the artist, which I thought was general interest (sweet), until I said I may at some point get a ""big, wild under-boob tattoo"" (there’s gotta be a better word for that), which was mostly a joke, as I only have very small, particularly meaningful tattoos. He looked visibly uncomfortable and I asked what was wrong and after assuring me that it would be fine (to which I sarcastically said ‘gee, thanks’ like the assole I am), he asserted “but I wouldn’t be okay with a man doing it.” I said that was silly, they are professionals, and I would go to the same artist I had for others (a man) and he kept insisting that that isn’t okay and told me I don’t understand how men think and that I was being insensitive to his discomfort about men seeing my body. 

Now this feels like I’m being dramatic, but for context, he has also stated that he would consider my going out with male friends and dancing with them to be cheating, while my being physical with a woman does not constitute cheating (I am bi). I would never cheat on someone, but the rules related to gender for both cheating and—admittedly less important—tattoo artists made me irrationally angry. 

So I proceed to try to engage in conversation, which results in me getting frustrated about what I think are nonsense rules and him being hurt that I am not more understanding of his needs. I told him he has no say in what I put on my body and who puts it there and I know I raised my voice when I said it, but his only response was along the lines of “of course I don’t, but also it makes me uncomfortable so you’d need to okay it with me first.” I know I went a little off the rails at this point, because then I asked his opinion on my having a male doctor and a variety of hypotheticals of varying levels of obnoxious. He told me I was being an asshole and that I should be listening to his concerns more and be more open to his needs when he tells me what makes him uncomfortable. I essentially said his discomfort related to my tattoos is not my problem and I’m not going to go out of my way to make sure he is okay with something that has no actual control over and refused to budge. I want to bring it up again, but we both seem pretty firm in our stance, so I doubt it would be productive at this point, and bringing it up may be yet another reason for me to be called an asshole. ",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4830548,public,top,self,AITA for picking a fight with someone over a hypothetical tattoo I don't even want?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z67opf/aita_for_picking_a_fight_with_someone_over_a/,all_ads,6,,,,

A wonderful cousin of my husband is staying with us to make some money by helping take care of our kids. We love her. One night we ordered pizza in. I come from a pizza-obsessed family. This pizza is from the most beloved and respected pizza place in area. So we get the kids settled and everything ready on the table -- napkins, red pepper flakes, oregano, etc -- and everyone makes their first choice of slices.

All of a sudden, this cousin takes an enormous bottle of ranch dressing out and holds it over this perfect, untouched, Chicago-thin-crust pepperoni slice. She squeezes and I see squirts of white sludge deface the char-crusted cheese and meat top. Again and again the rivers of hydrogenated chemicals hit the pizza, completely mocking hundreds of years of pizza-craft. Finally, it’s drenched, the poor slice is barely keeping one or two upturned pepperoni edges above the ocean of ranch. 

I'm horrified. It's hurting my heart. 

i say *""What are you doing?""* 

She says the pizza tastes better with Ranch dressing. 

I say, well it's not pizza now. It’s something else. It’s not pizza the way I know pizza. It's just a tasty carrier for ranch dressing. I firmly believe the ranch dressing is destroying the pizzaness of the pizza. She continues eating the adulterated pizza. 

I tell her in this house we do not pour ranch dressing over pizza. My husband butts in, and tells me to stop ordering people around about how they should or should not eat. I relent and silently eat my beloved pizza.

The next day I apologize to the cousin and say I'm a little crazy about pizza, sorry. I say that if it was just us, it wouldn't matter, but our kids are very impressionable and i can't have them becoming the kind of people who eat pizza with ranch dressing. I can’t besmirch the family traditions like that. She says its okay, its ""your house"", and suggests that she eat her pizza with ranch dressing in the kitchen while the kids eat with us in the dining room. I say, that sounds terrible! She says, no, it’s okay, I understand etc. I say, okay, well, let’s try it 

So we order a few pizzas after that and she keeps her word. The impressionable kids are not aware that in just the other room, an unpardonable sin against pizza is taking place. 

All is good until my husband’s father and mother visit and we get the same pizza for take out. The cousin eats alone in the kitchen with her pizza in ranch dressing. My husband, who I neglected to inform about this negotiated solution, says “Why is \_\_\_\_ eating in the kitchen.” I say “She eats in there so the kids don’t see her eating pizza with ranch dressing.” 

My husband explodes. He says what I’ve done is so rude, he can’t believe it. He says I have humiliated his family and that I’m an enormous asshole.

For those of you who are familiar with Pokemon and the anime, they aired the last episode of the anime in Japan a week ago, but the english dub won't make it in to the US until at least a few months from now.
 
Now I didn't expect reddit  other social platform to keep quiet wether as to wether Ash won the tournament, I mean it a huge monumental victory not only in Japan but also here in detail, so I wasn't mad at that.  

Now it's a whole other thing to spoil who the last 2 standing 'mon ls are on each team that got me a little bothered.

Well, someone made some a fanart of the last 2 Pokemon standing on each team, and the post title clearly points out who those last 2 pokemon were. They didn't even bother blurring out the image.

I wasn't even part of the reddit community where this was posted.  For those of you who are unaware, reddit shows you posts that their algorithms think you might like.

Well, I put a comment stating ""spoiler much"" and have been downvoted.

Again, it doesn't bother me much knowing who won, but it bothers me that such a key important detail was revealed.  Again, this episode just aired about 1-2 weeks ago, and not 5 years ago.

Never an argument.  Some disagreements along the way about politics but hey, we are different people and won’t ever think the exact same way.  So we work through them. 

Trust has been an issue for me my whole life, as my dad left at a young age and yes abandonment and “Daddy Issues” run deep. 

After finding out that many wedding items from my husbands first marriage 20 years ago have been left around the house (pictures, videos, plates etc) for the comfort of his children growing up (they are now 20 and 22), I am stunned.  Their mom turned into a drug addict and basically abandoned them which caused them trauma and pain.  Seeing the pictures and videos I understand helped them know they came from “a place of love”.   This I understand, but when I discovered the china we used to serve Thanksgiving dinner to his family (which they use every year before he married me and were a wedding gift to him and his ex wife from his recently deceased parents) I was deeply saddened.  I thought it was his parents china.  

It pains me beyond belief to think he does not only want to give them up but to continue to use them for holidays?!  I’d like if we can get our own dishes to use.  I am so upset and this is literally the first time I’ve felt “hurt” in our relationship.  I am extremely sensitive, this is no secret to him.  He said he’d give them away but after conversing with his daughter he has now changed his mind and states he will not give them up EVER even as he sees my tears.

So family (and step kids) usually have to split holidays between: my mom, my dad, my husband’s parents, as well as their bio mom’s mom, bio mom’s dad, and bio mom’s husband’s parents. It’s already very complicated, but my family was super strict on Covid so we didn’t see them as much the last couple years. I was looking forward to getting to spend time with everyone. Both my parents had specifically mentioned being excited about spending the holidays together for real this year. 

But then my mom called, and asked if I would be able to travel for thanksgiving. It’s my first thanksgiving married, so I certainly wasn’t going alone, we typically have to balance seeing many families, and we already have a trip planned for after Christmas, so we couldn’t swing it. I told her I couldn’t come. She asked if I would be okay with them going. This is where, in particular, I think I may have been the asshole, because I told her I’m sure we’d work something out for the holiday. In truth, my feelings were hurt, BUT I don’t feel it’s my place to tell her not to enjoy a trip with my sister just because I can’t go. 

Then the week before Thanksgiving, none of the families had reached out, so I started to. My dad told me he and his wife were going to her brother’s house, but that he’d order us turkey sandwiches from Quiznos. My husband’s family had to work (they’re chefs at a hotel.) We tried to get together the stuff to make our own meal, but couldn’t find any turkey’s, our kitchen is very small, and to be honest we’ve never done it before, and with so little time to prep decided we didn’t want to try and ruin the whole thing. We ordered an IHOP pancake feast instead and in all honesty the whole day was really sad. Still told our families happy thanksgiving and such. 

A few days before thanksgiving, a Facebook memory popped up about controversial topics to talk about at the thanksgiving table. I shared it and in jest captioned it “y’all think these posts are why my family ditched us for thanksgiving?” (I had shared it last year, also as a joke, our holiday get togethers have always been very pleasant, we’re not a family that argues much.)

I am 21 F and work full-time in a visitor services position at a museum/ nonprofit following an internship. My senior colleague (idk how old he is, I'm guessing early thirties) literally drives me insane. 

It's always little things. First, he always mansplains everything to me. Simple tasks, things he has already told me, etc. One time he mansplained ""what the difference between a watermelon and cantaloupe is."" It irks me a lot, and when its job-related it comes off as condescending. Whenever he's in the area of the building that I work in (front desk) he is always pacing around, walking really quickly throughout the floor. In his defense, he's probably doing something ... but the pacing is unnecessary. He often leans over my desk, so much so that he is in my personal space. He often opens the door to my area (front desk), stands behind me / looks at my computer screen / is too close to me. I have a suspicion that he secretly looks at my computer screen to see if I'm ""doing work."" Lastly, he'll talk your ear off about the most bone-shatteringly boring conversation. And no, I can't get a single word in. 

So the worst part is that I suspect he is on the spectrum. Nothing is wrong with that, and I hope to be the last person to be an ableist. This makes me give him more sympathy but is it still okay to be annoyed/frustrated with him from time to time? He means well, but he comes off as condescending to me and that's when it feels warranted.

Since her beginning to recover we have had a pretty decent relationship and get along quite well: however her and my sister (23f) have always had a bad relationship as my sister got the brunt of my mums worst years. My sister makes it quite clear to my mum about how un-present she was in her life and how she still blames her for a lot of things. I see this hurts my mum so I do my best to do the opposite of that. I never talk about her alcoholism and I never get mad or even moody with her because I know she will make it all about the past and how I will never forgive her. 

The other night I was very stressed because I have upcoming exams and so, god forbid I was not in the best mood. My mum came into my room and just sat on my bed and looked at me but I just blocked her out because I was not in the mood. She then blows up asking why I am so mad at her and so moody. This GRATES me, I am a teenager and sometimes I am moody, but I have restrained myself so much these past  years to keep in my emotions and so she never sees my moods. She acts as if it is a crime for me to emotional. I don't say anything other than the fact I am not mad just stressed. She then goes on and on about how she doesn't want to screw me up like she did my sister and I couldn't take it anymore.

I have never gotten so angry and basically started yelling at her and telling her how she screwed us both up. just because I was young does not mean I don't remember everything that she did and it annoys me that she only seems to remember about my sister going through it.

Hello Team,  
I (F35) come from a fairly fit family. Primarily I've been a runner for the last 10+ years. To stay well rounded, I also do a variety of cross training, including lifting weights. If I could live multiple lives, I am certain I would live one of them as a personal coach/trainer. I have a few college courses under my belt in that arena, but nothing substantial.

One of my friends (M32) goes in and out of working out. Think 9 months off, 3 months on. He said on average he hits the gym about 6 times per month. In the last 2-3 months he's started hitting the gym regularly; possibly even excessively. I've asked him about his work out regime since it interests me. He says he doesn't have one. There's no set plan on what he'll lift and when, etc.

The other night he told me he went to the gym crossfaded and got a 1 rep max on bench of 315.  
I asked him more about it as 315 seems like a pretty impressive bench for someone that isn't a gym regular and doesn't have a work out regime.

After some back and forth I told him I didn't think he'd benched 315. He balked and claimed again that he had and that he regularly benched 225 for reps. I told him I'd like to see it next time he benches. He said I could see him the next week and when he did it, I'd owe him a kiss on the lips. I am not romantically interested in him and declined the bet. He got upset and hasn't spoken to me since.

We basically did everything to get him here and settled. Tim met a girl, Jane, and when COVID hit, they sheltered at Jane's family's place. They got close, needless to say, and got engaged. For a couple years we'd been planning to attend his college graduation, and Tim's parents would fly out from the Philippines to join us. There are two ceremonies, with the smaller one on the first day having only 3 guest tickets, and the plan was my wife and I would bond with the baby of their family (my other nephew) while Tim went with his girlfriend and my in-laws (Tim's parents), and all of us could attend the larger ceremony the 2nd day. Well, my in-laws' visas were denied and they couldn't leave the Philippines. Tim hastily decided that his girlfriend's parents would take his parents' tickets instead, instead of us. Or a better compromise - one parent from each side (my wife and Jane's mother)? Tim said, no that wouldn't be fair to Jane's father. My wife and I paused and thought about this: we're leaving ours kids behind with their grandparents, taking days off from work, flying 6 hours from the coast, driving 4 hours to this college town, and sit in the hotel for the entire 1st day with nothing to do? Could we take a later flight, but won't join for dinner until 7pm? Tim said no, girlfriend's family are early eaters and would like to eat at 5pm. Okay, what if we just fly in the 2nd day for the larger 2nd ceremony, and then we can catch up after the ceremony for dinner and sightseeing? Tim said, actually my girlfriend's family is taking me home right after the ceremony (they live 2 hours away).

When we met, another girl, about my age, who worked with us had a massive crush on my partner. Before we became exclusive, this girl was extremely flirty and forward with her, several times in front of me, making me extremely uncomfortable and completely disregarding my being there. I felt so insecure at the time, and when we left that workplace I asked that she cut contact with the girl, which she did. I also cut contact with several friends which my partner didn’t like, none of which had ever fancied me or come onto me like that. 

A few months ago, after years of regretting cutting contact with my friends for 4-5 years, I gave my partner an ultimatum, to accept my friendship with these people who I’d known for years and were important school friends, or we would end the relationship. It was a tricky time but we got through it intact, with my friends back in my life which I’m extremely happy about. I told her from the beginning that I never expected her to be friends with them herself, add them on social media etc. just to accept my friendship and me seeing them every now and again as a little group. However, she only felt it fair that she reconnect with said girl from our previous work, which I said was fair, so she did. Since then she has met up with this girl three times to have a drink with her, and though I’ve had my own anxieties about them meeting, I do trust my partner and I feel good about her having her own friend to spend time with too. 

After seeing her again last night, my partner has now asked me to go with her to meet the girl (and her girlfriend) for a drink, which is my worst nightmare. The very thought of being back in that situation makes me feel physically sick, and while I can accept their friendship and even encourage it, I don’t want this girl back in my life and do not want to socialise with her at all. My partner is really angry and disappointed with my not wanting to see her. She did meet one of my old friends a few weeks ago on my birthday, and she made a good effort with him. However she had never met him before, and though myself and him had had a drunken shower together as teens, nothing ever happened between us and she knows that. She also said she wanted to meet him herself. 
She said it’s rich of me not agreeing to see her friend after she met mine, but I argued that the two situations can’t be compared and my friend never treated her the way that her friend treated me.

 She’s said she’s embarrassed by me not moving on from the past. I feel that I’ve done quite well in accepting her friendship with the girl, but I’m just not willing to see her myself. I’m in no way limiting her own friendship with her, I’ve even said I’m okay with her going around her house providing the girlfriend is there too. I really don’t know if I’m in the wrong or not.

With each family trip we have taken in the past I have always had to share a room or even a bed with one of my sisters, which didn't bother me cause I was young and my sisters and me were close but now we arent, and i'm older so i'd rather not.

It's a combination of a lot of small things that have made me come to the decision of never wanting to go on a family vacation until I can afford to travel in my own car and pay for my stay, including that since we are 5, all the seats in a car are taken and I always have to sit in the middle, which comes from ageist beliefs the rest of my family have. This again, is one of those things i didn't mind growing up (but even though my sisters have always been bigger than me and i was always skinny, im getting thicker and i am squashed between two people who have also gotten bigger over the years, to the point where my thighs become painful after a 3 hour drive), but it's uncomfortable being in that position when sisters and me are not talking to each other, and they are being petty (like not giving me leg room or purposely sitting in such a way that i have to rest my elbows on my knees cause they've put their arms on my headrest, the little things).

I guess I'm just tired of everyone's decision being led by the fact that i should always be the one to be inconvenienced cause im the youngest. I can tolerate it when it comes to things like them not taking anything i say seriously, or them not respecting me, my things or my space but a family vacation is supposed to be therapeutic, enjoyable and memorable.

I (28 F) have dated my current boyfriend (27M) for almost seven years. We've been through a lot together: the ups and downs of handfuls of jobs in our early twenties, playing in a band together for several years, the purchase and subsequential selling of our first home, the adoption and later death of a beloved pet that brought us closer together, several nice vacations, etc. We've grown up together and I do love him but have struggled with a feeling of incompleteness and unhappiness over the years. For the most part I've always chalked this up to dealing with an unfortunate combo of anxiety and depression, and for the most part keep it to myself. He is a great guy but I am more with him out of convenience these days rather than feeling anything romantically towards him.

But now that we no longer own a house together (this is due to a natural disaster and unrelated to our relationship), the option to leave and start fresh is on my mind daily. Any time I think of our relationship, it's the negative emotions (fear of being alone, fear of living on my own, loneliness) that keep me with him rather than positive emotions (my love for him, what we have in common, etc). I feel like if the negative emotions and fears are what's keeping me with him and feel stronger than the positive emotions, then that should be a sure sign it's time to move on and start fresh.

I've debated breaking up with him a multitude of times over the past two or three years but always become too afraid of being alone and refrain from doing so. But for once, we have no travels on the calendar coming up and I could easily get out of the apartment we have leased together. I would love to just break up with him now and not waste his time any further. HOWEVER. The holidays are coming up and I don't want to put a damper on family plans both sides have already prepared for. I don't want to answer endless questions about why we aren't together anymore, and I don't want the embarrassment of constant sympathy or pity thrown my way from family that should honestly mind their own business. It's a stressful time of year for me already and I just don't want to add more to it.

Also, the waiting lists for apartments in my area are long. If I am to break up with him now, I'd be faced with the unpleasant reality of still having to live together for several weeks or possibly months while I find my own place. This sounds terrible to me.

So, despite no longer having feelings for him AITA for waiting to break up with him until after the holidays? My plan would be to go ahead and start searching for apartments now, and then in January or February I can break up with him and have another living situation ready to go and can move out within a few days of the breakup.
