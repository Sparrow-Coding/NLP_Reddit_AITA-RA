So, me \[29F\] and my fiance \[34\] just got engaged and I moved into his place, it's been about 3months and then his sister asks him if she can have the flat next door - we will be sharing the bedroom wall.

He never said no, and then when I said, it's too close we need privacy, he said he couldn't say no because they'd get upset and he didn't want to deal with his upset family.

So I said he'd rather have an upset wife? We come from very different backgrounds and had worked through  a lot of relgious and cultural differences and agreed we should live away from our families as between us it is fine but not so much them. So you can understand how frustrating it is when his sister 26F moves in the same block. 

The sister - She's okkay, nice. But she did refuse to ever meet up with me before we were engaged and I've held onto that because she still expects my fiance to drop everything at her call, the same goes for his mum.

His mum is a housewife and spends her time every other weekend visiting her kids. Fiance assured me I was marrying him and not his family, but this is clearly not the case.

I've mentioned this to him and about setting better boundaries with his family, but I feel it's fallen on deaf ears. He is more interested in keeping his family sweet and I'm expected to adjust. This is sore point because I really fought my own family for this relationship and now know he won't do the same for me.

I'm frustrated to the max and kind of want out.

It’s textbook emotional incest, in my opinion. From the get go, his mother never liked me. I’m the first girl he had ever brought home to meet family and it’s almost like she’s threatened by me. She has two other children, both significantly older than my fiancé and from different fathers, but my fiancé is her favorite child and she has blatantly said that. She never treats her other childrens partners this way, only me, despite me basically kissing her ass and doing everything I can to be accepted in the past 2 years. My fiancé has never felt very close to her. In a lot of ways, he raised himself and has never been interested in having a close bond with his mom, so the obsession is very one sided. There’s too many issues and comments she’s made to describe, but she has basically been rude to me every time we see her. My fiancé also has a major issue with standing up to her. Before anyone comes at him and says I should break up with him for this, it’s important to note that fiancé suffered severe emotional trauma as a child and has had issues with conflict ever since. He basically freezes up when his mom starts screaming at him and I believe it’s a trauma response. He’s in therapy and working on his ability to communicate better and more assertively, but in the meantime, I told him I’m not comfortable being around his family if I can’t trust him to defend me. I have stood up for myself in the past, but being around her is so draining and I feel like I’d be able to handle interacting with her better if my fiancé wasn’t simply a bystander. At this point, I think it’s best to get distance from her and avoid seeing her until my fiancé is confident in his ability to help me set healthy boundaries with her (ex, being able to say “if you continue to insult my partner, we are going to leave this family function”). However, my fiancé is reluctant to agree because that is his only parent (his asshole father left the family when he was 6). His mother is essentially the only family he has, and although he recognizes the toxicity, he has the mindset of “family is family” and we should just put up with the drama. I straight up told him that I’m not comfortable attending family functions with his mother, and frankly, I’m not comfortable with him going without me, since I know MIL is going to talk shit about me behind my back and I can’t trust fiancé to put an end to it.

I live in the US with my husband but I’m from England and my siblings, parents and extended family are all there. We live within 15 minutes of my husbands parents. 
My parents visited recently to meet my daughter, and they plan to come again in the spring. I would like to also take a trip to England with my daughter to see my parents and meet extended family. I’d also like the trip to get away as I’ve been stuck in the house since the beginning of COVID and I’m quite burnt out from taking care of a baby 24/7 for the last 6mo. 
My husband doesn’t like my family (I don’t take it personally, he doesn’t really like his family either) and we have four pets who are quite high maintenance and would take a little bit of effort to find boarding/care while we are gone. For these reasons I feel it makes sense for me to go alone with my daughter, as my husband wouldn’t enjoy any part of it and he could just stay home with our pets. To be clear, he is 100% invited and I’d love to not go by myself but I know he doesn’t want to, and I don’t think he would be motivated to put in the effort to finding alternate pet care and we would just end up not going. 
When I mentioned it to him he said pretty definitively that I can’t go because he doesn’t want to be away from our daughter. I think he should be ok with it since I do 98% of the childcare (he works but I do all nights, days and most of the evenings and weekends) and it would be really good for my mental health. I feel like he is being controlling by saying I can’t. 
Again to reiterate, he is invited if he will actually make the effort to help arrange things for us to go but I think he would make it hard enough that we wouldn’t end up going.

Everyone in this story is a 19-20 year old college student. We're all in the same friend group. 

It started when I told Shauna, one of my closer friends in the group, that I had slept with Henry, a guy in our group, twice. I didn't want to get in a relationship w him at the time for reasons I don't wanna explain here, but that's neither here nor there. 

A couple days later, Shauna told me she wanted to reciprocate my openness and tell me a secret that had been driving her insane. She told me how since childhood, she had trouble with bedwetting, and still wears diapers to bed, since she still has fairly frequent accidents. She said it really harmed her social life, especially with dating, where she feared guys who stayed over would be turned off. I comforted her and we both agreed to keep each other's secret.

A week later, we all (in our group) went out to dinner. Henry, one other guy, and I arrived a bit later, as we got pulled over :( So, when we walked into the restaurant, it was just Henry and I (the other dude went to the bathroom) walking side by side to the table where our friends were. As we neared the table, Shauna called out, ""How was your guys' make-out session in the parking lot?""

Though I was a bit stunned, I responded that we got pulled over, explaining our absence (it's also stupid to insinuate that we were making out in the lot, seeing as she knew the other guy came with us). She replied, ""So you and Henry haven't been hooking up?"" I had no clue what happened since I last saw her, but Shauna was betraying me. 

""At least I don't wet the bed every night like a baby,"" I responded. Since she betrayed me and our agreement, I deemed it appropriate to violate my end of the bargain. However, my friends didn't see it this way, they saw this as me keeping something from them and humiliating Shauna when she brought the truth to light.

Since, it's been around a month. Henry and I are together now and pretty happy in a new group of people. To be honest, the whole incident kinda left my mind last week, but after seeing another aita post abt someone's reaction to bedwetting this morning while mindlessly scrolling reddit during public econ, I decided to create a burner (my old friends know my reddit) and see the internet's feelings on this dispute.

He is military and gets a base pay plus extras for various things, such as housing and COLA (though COLA was recently taken away due to decrease in costs here). In the States, the military pays the rent directly. We’re overseas currently, so the pay is given to him, then he pays the housing agency. 

Currently, I make more money than him. I also work for the military as a contractor. However, I only worked the first year of our marriage and then didn’t work for two years due to various circumstances (frequent moving, baby, trouble finding employment after moving overseas). During those two years, he took over all of my bills: car payments/insurance, student loans, etc. If I ever needed money, he would hand it to me without question. I say this because it’s important to note that he’s not stingy with his money and never made me feel guilty for not working due to circumstances beyond my control. 

Right now, we split bills. He’s pays some, I pay others. We don’t have any joint accounts because we don’t have the same spending habits and we’re both of the opinion that as long as the bills are covered, we don’t care what each other does with their money (within reason - we’re both fairly responsible). 

However, it’s a constant conversation that he pays more in bills because I refuse to contribute to rent. I don’t contribute because the military covers the cost. As I saw on the comments on the other post, as far as I’m concerned, that bill doesn’t exist because it’s covered by the military. If we lived on base or in the States, he wouldn’t ever see that money because they would pay it directly. But because we live off-base overseas, they provide the money to him and he goes and pays it. Because the money comes to him, he sees it as part of his paycheck. I disagree and cheekily said that we’ll just live on base next time (neither of us want to do this) because then the bill nor the money coming to him would exist and it would solve this problem.

For context, we met on Tinder and are both in our late twenties. I told him I wanted something casual in our first few dates. Around date five I started catching feelings and realized I'm not cut out for casual dating when I started feeling insecure that he'd alluded to hooking up with other women. I also asked him to get STI tested after learning he had had sex with about ten women in the last year, sometimes without protection.

He got STI tested and ended up testing positive for something.  We met up that day to talk about it and the future of our relationship. During that conversation, I told him that I only wanted something serious/exclusive. I asked why he looked so upset and he explained that a friend ended their friendship earlier that day after he informed her of the positive STI result. I felt uncomfortable since it basically confirmed that this ""friend"" who he alluded to before was actually a FWB. I also didn't feel great that he was telling me his sad feelings about another intimate relationship. He however reassured me that he came into the conversation knowing that he wanted to continue seeing me, even if that meant ending other casual relationships, and that I was a special person.

About a week later, we were hanging out and he wanted to see my Tinder matches/conversations to see what it was like from a woman's perspective. I felt uncomfortable by his request and said no. He took out his phone and started looking at our previous conversation on Tinder. I noticed that there were a couple conversations after ours (we matched maybe a month before), and I started tearing up after seeing that.

He then tried reassuring me and offered to delete Tinder then. He also beat himself up for making me cry, as he'd had never even thought to look for whether my Tinder had other match's conversations besides ours. He deleted the app and then almost immediately after said ""oh, I kind of regret deleting all my conversations,"" after which I started crying even more.

This launched into an argument where he said he didn't realize that talking about any past dating experiences/relationships was a full boundary not to cross with me. He kept making an analogy about the ""center of this bullseye being talking about relationships with other women, and around this bullseye there's mentioning Tinder conversations with other women which is also apparently off limits"". By this point, I was sobbing and felt very misunderstood.

It’s textbook emotional incest, in my opinion. From the get go, his mother never liked me. I’m the first girl he had ever brought home to meet family and it’s almost like she’s threatened by me. She has two other children, both significantly older than my fiancé and from different fathers, but my fiancé is her favorite child and she has blatantly said that. She never treats her other childrens partners this way, only me, despite me basically kissing her ass and doing everything I can to be accepted in the past 2 years. My fiancé has never felt very close to her. In a lot of ways, he raised himself and has never been interested in having a close bond with his mom, so the obsession is very one sided. There’s too many issues and comments she’s made to describe, but she has basically been rude to me every time we see her. My fiancé also has a major issue with standing up to her. Before anyone comes at him and says I should break up with him for this, it’s important to note that fiancé was abused physically and sexually as a child and has had issues with conflict ever since. He basically freezes up when his mom starts screaming at him and I believe it’s a trauma response. He’s in therapy and working on his ability to communicate better and more assertively, but in the meantime, I told him I’m not comfortable being around his family if I can’t trust him to defend me. I have stood up for myself in the past, but being around her is so draining and I feel like I’d be able to handle interacting with her better if my fiancé wasn’t simply a bystander. At this point, I think it’s best to get distance from her and avoid seeing her until my fiancé is confident in his ability to help me set healthy boundaries with her (ex, being able to say “if you continue to insult my partner, we are going to leave this family function”). However, my fiancé is reluctant to agree because that is his only parent (his abusive father left the family when he was 6). His mother is essentially the only family he has, and although he recognizes the toxicity, he has the mindset of “family is family” and we should just put up with the drama. I straight up told him that I’m not comfortable attending family functions with his mother, and frankly, I’m not comfortable with him going without me, since I know MIL is going to talk shit about me behind my back and I can’t trust fiancé to put an end to it.

I'm in college and my roommate’s Alena. In September, we became fast friends because we're similar to each other. We bonded over our same major ((therapy studies)), love for competitive bowling, historically royal Filipino genetics, and childhood Hello Kitty obsessions. Our most major major difference is finanical upbringings. Alena grew up wealthy because her parents were BTS ((behind-the-scenes)) film producers. I on thother hand lived in a small apartment in a ""ghetto"" or ""hood"". I can only attend the same college as somebody like Alena cause I got scholarships ((shh)).

Last week at night recently once, me and Alena were up ((2AM)) in our dorm finishing work. When done, we couldn't sleep and felt like pulling an allnighter. Alena made the fateful suggestion to share our darkest secrets. I really regret doing so because late nights remove my filter. Basically I was there, vulnerable in my bed, vulnerable in my own head, letting my secrets ooc.

I told Alena something I did three times now, all in the past 2 years. I'm a concertgoer first of all. I don't come from wealth as I said, and hadda spend big bank for shows &amp; meet-to-greets, so I make the most of each. So after each concert - before one of the 3 concerts, which I didn't end up actually going to ((you'll get why later)) - are the meet-to-greets, where my dirty likkle secret takes place.

I'ma generalize what happened all 3 times. I intentionally faint in front of celebs at their meets. Not cuz I'm enchanted to meet them, but cuz I want to live like/with them. I've heard of others ((allegedly)) doing so and recovering at a celebrity's home. I strategically leave all personal identifiers in the car, and if went as wanted, the celeb’d prioritize me, I'd ‘wake up’ at the hospital saying IDK who I am, and then I'd live a dreamlife life in a celeb's home for as long as it could last.

This never went as pland. Each time after fainting, emergency people come while the celebrity disregards me and mets other fanatics. I get taken to a hospital, but the celebrities are never there so I don't lie about knowing my dentity. I was fine from my ‘faint’ everytime obvo, though they did find I had corona the most recent time ((mi corona is still a secret)). I Uber home and then look back in regret, only to do it all two, one, or maybe no times ((currently))? again.

I told Alena all this and she said I was 'gasslighting' her. She thought it was made up! I showed pictures taken the same day from a concert and hospital, from the most recent one 2 weeks ago. Alena soon realized that 2 weeks ago I was really at the hospital rather than the ""concert going late"" like I told her and exploded at me for not being there for our ((failed)) room inspection that following day cuz I was hospitalized for lying. She thinks I'm psycho, but I think she doesn't get my POV cuz she's been surround by celebs and cash her whole life. She and her girls have started picking on me about being a ""freak"" all week.

The initial shopping cart my wife had from Amazon had over $300 worth of decorations. I asked her to bring it down closer to $100. She agreed, and I thought that was the end of it.
A few day later she went to spend time with her sister and came back with  more decorations. I didn't say anything.


Then yesterday we were at Target looking for our annual couples' ornaments. After finding some really cute ones my wife wanted to keep looking. She ended up adding garlands, bows, about $80 worth of decorations. I put my foot down that this isn't what we had agreed on and she was really hurt I didn't budge.


We recently bought a house and have been spending more than usual. For Halloween we went all out and spent well over $300 between decorations and hosting a party. We in theory have a budget for personal spending but that's not very well respected (that or the numbers are off). 
But honestly, finances are the weakest part of our relationship and any of my multiple voiced concerns gets received very negatively. I'm concerned we'll drain our savings with death by a thousand cuts, and she wants the house to feel homey. 


The argument is no longer over the decorations and definitely got out of hand. I can be emotionally numb, and she has very strong feelings. She feels I'm financially controlling, I feel she's financially aloof. For what it is worth, we each have our own separate accounts and a shared account for shared bills. But most of the big purchases somehow tend to come from my savings, and she knows how to create the most welcoming environments. So we are both at an impasse and feeling like shit ATM, and this maybe should've been a rant. I'm at a loss, and will be seeking couples therapy.

I (28F) have had a pretty strained relationship with my mom (60F) for most of my life. She's had some unfortunate circumstances, lost custody of us to my dad, my dad married the woman he had an affair with, got into substance abuse and has had some pretty unpleasant partners. I don't blame all of it on her or dad, and I've tried to not hold onto grudges about stuff from my childhood. 
However, I have tried to give my child (9m) a better childhood than I had and have mostly raised him without the father. I tried to also protect my son and I'm cautious about what he's exposed to, I don't mention stuff from his father's and my relationship or that his dad has been in and out. We've done alright and have a nice house and I make decent money, so I think anyway. 
My mom is in a similar spot that she was in when I was a teenager and lives in a camper with her boyfriend who's an alcoholic (multiple DUIs). They also chainsmoke to no end. It is also suspected she might be dappling in substances again (she said she messed up like 2 years ago). 
She wants my son to stay overnight coming up on Friday and I told her no. She says that she washed the blankets and that they won't smoke in their place. It's somewhat true that I'm concerned about smoking and third hand smoke, but also her partner gets drunk and stumbles about. However, she's got weird behaviors she exhibits (difficulty keeping still, occasionally sees stuff, like ""out of it"") that makes me nervous. I didn't tell her directly about her but she took offense to it and hung up to call my brother. I feel really bad and I want my son to have a relationship with her but the choices she has made in life doesn't make me feel comfortable. 
I did present an alternative of my partner bringing him Saturday. It's also worth mentioning my nephews are going to be there. I might just be extra overprotective because she also lived in a camper when I was a tween and that's when she was doing drugs and I would just be there while people went in and out. 
I don't think she would intentionally hurt them but I don't think she's very careful and I'd be like 2 hrs away.

I went NC around the birth of my 2nd child (I have 3) bc I asked for space and peace to end a difficult pregnancy and they harassed me right up to the day he was born. I snapped and told them that a lifetime of abuse (I'm the scapegoat/whipping post of the family. Recently diagnosed ASD/ADD) was no longer going to be glossed over by them sharing in the good times. I didn't like them, I didn't feel connected to them, I didn't even really KNOW them. I was done.

10 years later I get a phone call from a sib. They tell me that my eldest bro (53) has been diagnosed with cancer, he has weeks. I say sorry and to let me know if I can help at all. As expected I'm ignored. So I go back to radio silence trying to think if my bro needs me or if I'm just pinning the ""kick me"" sign back on myself.

Less than 2 weeks later the same sib rings to tell me my brother has passed. I express that I'm not sure if I should go to the funeral or not. I don't want to upset anyone but, well, we DID have the same mother and she couldn't represent herself... I decided to go, sit in the back and leave without saying ""boo"" to anyone at all.

I contacted my sister to find out the time and was told not to bother. His wife had said she didn't want me there. My dad (total narc, now NC but that's a whole other thread) told me it was illegal to ""crash"" a funeral and that he wouldn't drive me there in any case (the crem is outside of walking distance).

I posted a small tribute on my Facebook to him, saying goodbye and was contacted by mutual friends asking why I'd let childcare get in the way of saying goodbye in person? I posted that everyone knew the shocking way my family treated me and had I had the choice, I'd have gone for mum's sake. But I wasn't allowed to.

So this pops up in memories on FB and I'm finding myself angry again. I spoke to my youngest sib who said the middle/older bunch (I'm smack in the middle if it matters) had told the wife I'd create a massive fuss and would redirect the day to being about myself. I feel like I should defend myself BC it just wasn't true. But I don't want to hurt her, she did love my brother and I can only say I felt familial obligation to him, even in death. 

On the side of not saying anything is the fact that being away from my sibs honestly has bought me so much peace. I did miss them at first. It was hard going from all the noise of a big family to just me and my son.

I just can't help but feel I SHOULD have been there. I could have reached out to the mutuals but this would have left me stuck there when I really needed a swift getaway. I knew the day but not the time and I had a choice of 3 crems.

I feel like I let my mum down. She would have wanted me there. That's an inalienable truth. It's just who she was.

For context, Peyton and I are not friends, but share a mutual friend in Daphne who has gone home for the holidays for a month (Nov-Dec). All three of our names are on the lease, and we live in an all-electric building with only one unit per floor—meaning each unit has its own boiler, which we pay for along with the rest of our electricity bill, and we don't pay for gas or water usage.

Now this is where it gets tricky, because the boiler is a large part of why our monthly energy bill is so high—our bill was $350 during Sep-Oct, and $306 for Oct-Nov 7. I took a look at the breakdown and the highest percentage was ""other"" (unclear what that is) for $108, water heating was $105, appliances were $58, and lighting was $35. (I’m completely aware that our electric bill is significantly higher than other renters in New York, and we're trying to figure out why since we hardly use it.)

Prior to Daphne leaving we didn't discuss how we would split the bill if any one of us left. Daphne asked if she could skip out on November's utility bill because she wasn't here, and initially I agreed, because a month is a pretty long time and it seemed unfair for her to pay for electricity that she didn't necessarily use. But then Peyton came to me saying she wanted to get five days off her portion of utilities since she wasn't here for Thanksgiving, and that although she stays at her friend's place sometimes for two or three days, she'll just count the five days instead of tallying up all the days she was absent. That annoyed me for the following reasons:

1. I wasn't there for the five days either, but even if I did agree I'd essentially be paying for both her portion and my own. The boiler is running regardless, the fridge is still running, all appliances are still plugged in. Even though the AC/heat is turned off, there's still gonna be a base fee regardless.
2. How is she going to deduct the exact amount of electricity she uses from her portion of the bill? Are we gonna argue about who takes longer showers? Who cooks more often? Who stays up more and uses more lighting?
3. Five days is WAY too short of a time to be excused, and why is it suddenly my responsibility to pay extra when she chose to be absent voluntarily? We initially agreed to split electric bills evenly when we first signed the lease, since we had heard from a previous tenant that energy bills were going to be exceptionally high. If one of us stayed in the apartment alone, $300 would be a serious financial burden for one person to handle. $150 is kind of a lot too with only two people splitting, and so I feel like she's trying to push her responsibilities onto me when it should be her duty.

I came to the conclusion that one month is the shortest time a roommate should be allowed to only pay the base fee (how to calculate that I'm still unsure), but Peyton is still pissed and doesn't think that she should have to pay for the days that she's gone.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4841942,public,,self,AITA for making my roommate pay for 5 days of utilities?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z97i5u/aita_for_making_my_roommate_pay_for_5_days_of/,all_ads,6,

I work in IT. I was asked to install a switch as our Wi-Fi in the building is horrible, trust me it's a work in progress, for a team of 8 people. I had to run Cat6 cable from the port around the floorboards, but I had them under cable guards so they aren't a tripping hazard. My schedule was already full up and this was a spur of the moment request, but I figured I could do it in a short time. I finished it in about 10 minutes, but admittedly, I left the cable management undone, and had planned to return and complete it.

A member of the team that wasn't here when I installed it came by and asked if I could clean it up as whomever installed it did a horrible job. I informed her I actually installed it and was going to clean it up after the team left so I wouldn't be in the way. She immediately apologized and said, ""I'm so sorry,  that was rude."" She left and I went over and cleaned it up while I had the time as there was only her and one other person there, so I wasn't in the way. She was uncomfortable around me and now I feel like I'm an AH because I could have just said, ""Yeah, I'll come clean it up."" and just not have even mentioned that it was me who installed it.

About 1.5 years into our relationship, one night, her phone started to ring on the kitchen counter, and she asked me to tell her who was calling. When I picked up the phone and checked the caller ID, my blood ran cold. The caller had the same name as my bully from summer camp for 4 years,  turns out it was him. She sat and I told her about my experiences with Matt. The bullying, verbal abuse, gaslighting, and on a few occasions straight up assaults. The only story she had heard from her family was how he had gotten kicked out of that camp, and she only knew a small amount of details. She had heard that Matt had gotten into a 'physical altercation' with another camper. To her credit, after I told her everything, she told me I would never have to see him again. And up until now she kept her word. After her grandpa died, she didn't pressure me to go to the funeral because Matt would be there.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, we got engaged 9 months ago. A few weeks after the news broke I got a DM on Instagram from Matt. It said ""Hey \[offensive name he used to call me\], congrats on the engagement. Looks like I'm going to get to see you a whole lot more"" My fiancé looked at it as him trying to reach out and put the past behind us. But I know what it was really meant to be, another attempt to bully me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't list everything that Matt did to me (I went over the character limit). So I'll just say what caused him to be kicked out which is the most egregious. He learned that one of the guys he practiced soccer with was my younger brother. He purposely sent my brother to the hospital then bragged about it to my face. My brother required surgery. He also bragged about it to another camper without realizing that the head of the camp was right behind him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Onto the conflict, the way we are putting together our guest list is she is in-charge of invites for her family and friends and I am in-charge of mine. I went on her computer to get something and when I opened it up, her invite list was opened and I saw his name. I asked her about it and she said that she wants him there and enough time has passed. They aren't that close. We argued for a while and neither of us would concede. Now it's blown up into a whole thing. His parents are refusing to come unless he's invited (because him getting kicked out was punishment enough), her parents will still come but are putting pressure on Anna. Even Matt reached out with a half-assed apology basically saying 'I'm sorry you felt bullied'. My parents say I should just cave. My brother isn't sure he will attend if Matt is invited. He's not sure how he will react if he sees Matt and doesn't want to ruin my wedding. Anna has now made the executive decision that he's invited and 'I can just deal with it'. As it gets closer to the invites going out, I have been having more and more anxiety and on a few occasions, panic attacks.

It's a decent area. We don't have a ton of crime, but every once in awhile, you'll hear about a package being stolen off somebody's porch.

Because we don't own a garage, my wife and I typically park our car on the street in front of our house. 

On Saturday, I had to move the car down the block a little so that one of our guests that night could use the space, and after I jumped in the car, I noticed that a small bag of toiletries belonging to my wife was sitting in the passenger seat. Although it's usually in the glove box, I didn't think much of it because my wife is in the middle of renewing the registration for our car and I figured she had taken the bag out when grabbing the old registration from the glove box.

Today, I went to use the car and I noticed the USB cable I used to connect my phone to the car for Android Auto was missing. I connected the dots and texted my wife that I thought our car had been broken into earlier in the week, and I asked her if she had left anything important in the car that might have gotten stolen.

I didn't get a response back.

A couple hours later, I knock on her home office door and ask if she got my text. She said she had, but she hadn't texted back because she was upset. She was frustrated because she thought I should have noticed earlier in the week when I saw the toiletries bag had been left out because she doesn't typically leave things out of place.

I explained my perspective, and eventually, over the course of a few minutes, we got around to trying to figure out who had left the car unlocked.

Long story slightly less long, she had picked up groceries to make dinner for our guests earlier this week, and I had helped her grab some groceries from the car. I assumed that she'd lock the door because she still had the keys after returning from the store, and she assumed I was responsible because I was the last one to come back from the car.

After she said that we need to get better at communication, I laughed a little and shook my head, feeling a little bit annoyed because I had been just been blamed for not noticing the car had been broken into, and now, a few minutes later, I was being asked to share the blame for it not getting locked.

After I laughed, she sighed and quietly told me to go fuck myself, and I left her office to give us both some space.

English isn’t my first language, so I do have a bit of an accent when I say certain words, and sometimes I fumble a bit grammatically but it’s never been too bad that no one knew what I was getting at.
My friends all know this, and they also know that if I’m not asking to be corrected and the sentence is understandable, they don’t really need to correct me.

Sam noticed while we were talking that I had an accent, so he asked me where I was from. I said that my dad is from the US but my mom was from Brazil, so I spoke Portuguese and sometimes Spanish at home but I only ever learned how to read/write in English. 

Sam kind of laughed and then said “Your mom *was* from Brazil? How does someone stop being Brazilian? The word you should have used was *is*.”

My mom passed away when I was 12, pretty much everyone at the table (other than Sam) was aware of that. So it got a little awkward and quiet when he corrected me. I shook my head and told him that no, my mother didn’t stop being Brazilian, she just stopped being alive, so that’s why I said *was*.

Sarah immediately got kind of pissed at me and said that I didn’t have to trauma dump at the table just because her boyfriend corrected the word I used in a sentence.
I said that I wasn’t really trauma dumping, I was just answering his question, but she said that I should have known how awkward it would get when I said something like that, and I should have just moved on without addressing it.

Lunch ended early because of the tension, and everyone else is telling me that yeah I didn’t really have to say it, but also I really was just responding to what he said to me.

Sarah’s pissed at me though, and I’ve got no idea how Sam feels about the whole thing because I don’t really know him.

For the past five years, I (17, M) have been working to get into a good college. I belong to a very competitive school and we are made to think about our future from a very young age. I worked my ass off and hardly had a social life. I used to sit in my room all day and study. Finally, my hard work paid off and I got accepted into a very prestigious university overseas. (I am pursuing app development). The moment I saw the acceptance letter, I was in tears. It was my life's goal to go there and it was a dream come true. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told my parents about this and they seemed really happy. however, the moment I told my grandparents about this, they were livid. they said I could not go overseas under any circumstances and that if I choose to go to the university, then I would never be able to meet my family again. Apparently, our family has a very religious background and still has a very primitive mindset. I involved my parents in this; they were silenced because my grandmother said it was either me or the entire family (which included my siblings as well 15, M, and 14, F). 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I put my foot down and told them that I will go to this university whether they like it or not. I had a huge fight with them and they asked me how I was going to pay for it. I said I would manage as I had a scholarship and I had also saved up quite a lot of money. I told them that if they choose to depart me this way, I would never show them my face again and that I would never enter that house. I also told them that I would have no contact with them whatsoever.

My close group of friends from college rented an airbnb this past weekend for a ski trip. 2 of us brought our girlfriends including me. For the sake of this story I will refer to my friend as Greg and my gf as GF lol. One night we were all drinking in the airbnb getting hammered. Greg loves to get hammered and drinks the most out of all of us but not by a long shot. The night was winding down as 1 by 1 people started to go to bed or pass out on other furniture. 

GF and I go upstairs to our room (the couples got the 2 bedrooms with 1 bed, there were multiple couches and rooms with bunk beds for the other guys) but when we go inside Greg is passed out in our bed. I wrapped him up in the blankets and through him off the bed. It was pretty funny I was laughing hard when he woke up and I told him to GTFO of our room. He said good luck to me and GF because he got all his farts and sharts out in the bed and peed a little. No, he did not actually poop or pee the bed. He was joking. GF is drunk and tired so her visible annoyance was expected but she fell asleep quickly and i thought that was it.

On our drive home the next day, GF was awfully quiet. I figured she was just hungover. BUT NAH. She hit me with the "" I thought Greg going in our room was really disrespectful and invasive of my privacy"" I told her that Greg was drunk and its not even our room its an airbnb. She told me that him and I are friends and she gets that I dont care but it was her space too and she said he should have known better. ""Like what if I had thongs or bras laying around?"" I said ""You dont think Greg has seen underwear before? PLUS nothing was left out"" GF says ""but still""

I thought she was being weird but it should be the end of it. Later that night back at our place she says ""I really dont want Greg over here anytime soon"" and i told her that 1. I own the place, her name is on nothing, greg can come over whenever he wants and 2. if Greg passing out in our room in an airbnb is triggering her this much, theres bigger issues at hand. I apologized for being blunt but i asked seriously why it bothered her so much. She said its ""just disrespectful and sexist, he thought it was okay because you wouldnt mind when he didnt even think about me"" Once again I said we were all drunk and i suggest she get over this.

Should I have gone anyways to buy her food? I knew that she wanted it badly. I would've eaten it too if we had driven there.

 1) I tagged my girlfriend in a post two posts on FB (each about a month apart).  
 2) Each time, I was able to view the tagged post on her Facebook page for hour after I posted.  
 3) Both times, after she logged in the tagged post was not viewable on her page.  
 4) Just the other day, I asked her why it wasn't on her page.  
 5) She responded, ""IDK, I didn't remove it. It must be a privacy setting.""  
 

SO THE QUESTION: Is there a single privacy setting which would allow the post to display on her page, and then disappear without her intentionally removing it? Am I the Asshole for not believing her?

It was the week before the wedding and we had been fighting about the bridesmaids dresses. She told me I can’t go if I’m going to wear the fur suit but I told her that she needs to start accepting who I am. She got mad at me and told me I can’t be a bridesmaid anymore. Obviously I was hurt but I guess she needs to keep up some sort of image for her husbands family. I end up showing up to the wedding with my tail and ears instead of the full fur suit because I didn’t want to cause a scene. In the middle of the service she starts yelling at me in front of everyone. She ripped my ears off and pulled out my tail. When it came off, my tail butt-plug fell onto the floor in front of EVERYONE. I was so humiliated and I started to burst into tears but she proceeded to tell me that I shouldn’t have showed up winnie the pooh style to her wedding.

She asked us if we were okay with her getting a cat, and I said sure as long as she takes care of it (especially since my fiancé and I have an adult cat and dog that we’ve had for years). Well, she found a kitten and decided to adopt. After getting the kitten, my roommate found out she was pregnant. The pregnancy was not expected or wanted, as neither of them could support a baby, so roommate decided on an abortion. During this time she acted like everything was normal, but I could tell she was struggling a lot mentally. She never got around to taking kitten to the vet so I wound up taking him there myself, and he was diagnosed with fleas. My roommate was very nonchalant about the fleas. He also pooped all over the brand new couch my fiancé and I had bought for the living room. My roommate never even apologized or cleaned it up. During this I have tried not to complain and to help her out, but I started to feel very overwhelmed myself. I could tell roommate was depressed (sleeping all day, calling into work constantly, etc) but to be fair, she does all of those things even before the pregnancy. We kindly asked her to isolate the cat in her room to prevent the fleas from spreading, but she insisted she couldn’t keep the litter box in her room because the smell was too strong (due to the pregnancy) and made her throw up. This was also her reasoning for not cleaning up the couch/floor when the kitten pooped on it. We insisted that the kitten go live with a family friend for two weeks while we deep clean the house to get rid of fleas- since we were worried about our own pets getting infected. Roommate complained but agreed. Foster family took kitten to vet and were told that kitten was lucky to be alive. Apparently roommate had given him adult cat flea medication multiple times and he had been poisoned and because of it. Vet said he also had malabsorption because of being poisoned and only time would tell if he would ever recover. When I told roommate about this, she blamed me and said the only reason she overmedicated the kitten was because I was complaining and “overreacting” about the fleas. Now, the two weeks of kitten being with foster family is up and roommate is happy to have him home, but she still hasn’t gotten him vaccinated and we don’t even know if he’s got permanent liver damage. If he does, I know roommate could not afford blood work or advanced treatment for him. In my mind, she’s already proven that she isn’t responsible enough for a pet and the kitten would be better off in a new home or shelter, but she loves this cat and it’s one of the only things making her happy rn. Whenever I bring up the kitten, roommate makes me feel like I’m overreacting or not being sensitive to the fact that she’s been going through a hard time, and she immediately shut me down when I suggested rehoming him.

My parents didn't tell me until I was in 7th grade, but I always showed the symptoms of it and I think I was pretty much the only person oblivious to it. One of the symptoms of autism (alongside some other disorders I have) is being easily overstimulated. What overstimulates me most is football pep rallies. Unfortunately, our school is very serious about football, so we have these pep rallies every week. Screaming competitions, drum line performances, and loud cheerleading chants are things that come along with every one of them. Last year, pep rallies were optional, but this year students are forced to go. I, like many others, hide in the bathroom during these. After a while, the idea of sitting in a bathroom for a solid 30 minutes started to gross me out, so I found a teacher that let me stay in his classroom during pep rallies. Yesterday, our school did something called a ""send off"" for our football players, which was basically like a pep ralley on full blast. As usual, I didn't want to go. But the teacher's classroom I usually went to was locked and with nobody inside. My friend and my boyfriend are also autistic, and so we asked our teacher for the period that the send off was in if we could stay behind. He said yes, as long as we stayed in the hallway. So, we did just that. After about 5 minutes of peacefully and quietly talking with my friend and my boyfriend, the principal walked down the hallway. He sees us and throws an absolute fit. He starts to yell at us, stomp his feet, and urge us to go to the send off immediately. ""But Principal [X], we got permission from our teacher."" My friend said. I pointed towards the room our teacher was in, but our teacher had left just before and so the room had nobody inside. The principal scoffs, rolls his eyes, and continues to scream at us. He even told my friend (who has POTS and walks with a cane) that they weren't ""standing up fast enough"". We kept trying to explain ourselves, but he refused to let us stay. ""I don't care what your teacher says, and I don't care that you get overstimulated. Your rude tone of voice won't work on me."" He shouted, even though we were all being polite. He kept insisting that we were being disrespectful, and it made me feel like I was the problem for showing these traits, even though I can't control them. I know I shouldn't beat myself up over it, but it makes me feel like maybe I need to try fitting into neurotypical standards more if my autistic traits are seen as rude. I also thought about how much this event means to the people on the football team, and I thought about how I would feel if people didn't come to events that celebrate my hard work.

His mom has a friend who owns a network of houses, and so a couple months ago she decided to open her own and this past month they finally got a house and recently started taking clients.

A little back story, I had been in group homes for about 4 years, and have seen a lot of chaos and stuff go down. 

My issue is that I feel like this is not the industry to just jump feet first in. He has a younger brother who’s like 18 that is running the house with him. His brother never had a job before and literally plays video games all day. They (my bf and mom) are trying to encourage independence and so decided he’d run the home with him and my boyfriend. Personally I think that’s a horrible idea, especially in a setting that is similar to group homes but with adults. 

Additionally, my boyfriend has experience caring for disabled people and a little experience working in group homes. Him and his brother did a evening of shadowing another house in preparation for this, and that’s it. So now that the house is up and rolling, they are “taking problems as they come” rather than being prepared in advance.
For example, they do not have cameras in the common areas. They also do not have any female or other staff members, it is just him and his brother living there 24/7. On top of that, my boyfriend has a wfh job from 8am to 5pm mon-fri. I know that most of the staffing will fall on him, as his brother isn’t very reliable and not really somebody that grown adults would listen too. 
I think that they saw a business they could make $$$ in and went right for it, but this is the wrong industry to do that in. Anything can happen because people are crazy, and it takes one “mistake” for something horrible to happen that you can’t take back. Having been in group homes, I know first hand the crazy shit that goes on, but nobody running the house does and it worries me. 

He is upset that every time he talks to me about the house I bring up these concerns, but I cannot give him the support he’s wanting because I feel like he is being naive and should not go into something so unprepared. At the very least they should get cameras for the common areas. I can’t fathom how he expects to run a home for recovering addicts with just his brother whom he can’t rely on, while he WORKS FROM HOME from 8am to 5pm.

My hair gets super frizzy in the fall/winter, so I decided during an ongoing mental breakdown, scoo it I'll damage it worse. My sister Paige (20, F) goes to cosmetology school and started her own small business last year, so I had access to her hair products. I have watched Paige bleach hair and I've even tried using her dyes on my friends' hair before, so it wasn't like I was going into it unexperienced. Paige conveniently lives at the dorm except on weekends, so I didn't (think I'd) have to worry about her finding out, and she'd just think I got it done professionally. Oh.

So on a Monday I bleached my hair, which took several hours admittably. By Wednesday it started looking too yellow, so I stole a couple bottles of purple shampoo from Paige's lair and put them in one of my bathrooms. I washed my hair with the shampoo that night, and it helped correct the color. I looked in the mirror and had an intrusive thought to use the shampoo on my toothbrush to get whiter teeth. I googled it and it said it was very dangerous but I couldn't find any records of people dieing from it. I was pretty drunk and tired, so I forgot I was going to use a toothbrush, and I tried to squirt it directly onto my teeth so I could brush the shampoo around after. Make sense? Well a lot came out at once, onto my teeth, and while I tried to reach for a towel I accidentally swallowed it. I rushed over to my mom to ask what to do, but while running I kinda past out (possibly from the beer, not necessarily from the ingested shampoo).

I fully woke up several hours later and I will spare you on what the doctors had to do to get the shampoo out of me. I was okay and alive, but since it was ""my fault"", my mom made me agree to pay the emergency room bill (I don't have health insurance). I got the bill two weeks ago, and the price was obviously something I wasn't comfortable paying. Fortunately Paige's money could cover it, so I went into her bedroom and got a lil stack and mailed it out. I even gave a tip which I'm not sure if is allowed, but I didn't wanna deal with counting one-dollar bills and coins.

Paige obviously knew about the hospital visit and me using her products and stuff, but she only found out I used her money on Sunday. Her rage was uncontainable and she even asked me to pay her back, which is ridiculous because I'm only 19 and don't have a job. I told her it's her responsibility since it was her shampoo that made me sick after all. She phreatened to take me to the bank and get money out of my account, after which I reminded her that I would tell our dad that Paige isn't his biological daughter because our mom went around a lot at the start of their marriage. So I'm kind of blackmailing so I'm wondering if I handled this really immaturely. I was mentally in a kinda exhausted place and just didn't have the energy to deal with things.

My mom had a birthday not so long ago. G. and his family came to celebrate. Once he was done with congratulations and birthday cake eating, G. straight up marched into my room to play on the PS5. I didn’t pay much attention to it and kept chatting with my mom. 

That’s where it gets interesting. After a while, G. pops up and says he can’t log in to my computer. 

Wondering why would he ever wanna do that, I follow him back to my room and find that two of my PS5 games now have creamy fingerprints on ‘em. That stuff pisses me off, as those games were quite costly. I tell G. that his self-assigned playtime is over and I won’t let him enter my room and touch my things again without clear permission. He proceeds to complain to my aunt. Somehow everyone is on G.’s side, even mom says “he’s a kid, he didn’t know”. Eventually aunt storms off, saying that “apparently they are not good to stay in such strict environment without a facemask and gloves”.

And now the whole family is pissed at me. Rightfully so?

TLDR; girl I was involved with moved out of state to marry another man, I gave her information and our shared history to his ex-wife.

This has been bothering me for quite a while, so I'm letting the internet decide, don't let me down!

I was ""seeing"" a girl (Jane) off and on for 18 months. Jane was an escort at the time, relevance to the rest of this story to follow. ""Seeing"" just means she refused to label our relationship... We spoke multiple times a week, covered some pretty sensitive topics, and talked mutually on things like buying property, marriage, kids, etc.

Jane of goes dark in Feb 2021, last I see her she comes over to my house for what is easily mistakable as a date (we were past doing things most ""friends"" would do). Jane tells me she's entering an ""exclusive arrangement"" with a client (Dick) out of state, I don't really know what that means so I don't ask questions.

Couple months go by, we text sporadically, I figure she's still in the arrangement. One stressful day in May, I reach out to see if she can chat. She agrees, we talk, and Jane casually tells me she's engaged to marry Dick. I don't take it well, I make it clear I'm upset and flat out ask her if this means we are done for good. Jane leads me on, and leaves me with ""it's not fair to make me choose, you're making me seem like the bad guy"" (paraphrasing). I'm done, we part with a hug.

Morbidly curious, I do some public record searches on Dick. Spoiler alert, Dick's a convicted felon (serial domestic abuse, violating domestic abuse restraining order, reckless endangerment, attempted murder, terrorizing) who served time and is currently on parole . But no worries, he's a multi-millionaire so those things don't really matter...

I'm ready to fully cut Jane off and forget about her, even confided in friends and family about the situation and made my intentions clear, but one thing keeps ringing in my head. In our last conversation Jane mentioned their intention to move back to my state once his probation ends, and Dick is also suing for custody of his estranged child (living with the mother/his ex-wife out of state).

I start losing sleep, literally, wracked with the idea that he is using my friend as ""cover"" to make it seem like he has a stable home for this child to live in. I'm also concerned that Jane is just using him for his money, and has no real love for Dick or her potential step-child.

I reach out to the ex-wife via her divorce attorney and provide personal and public records of Jane's history as an escort. I'm sure this all comes off as revenge, but I'll go on record saying my intention was to prevent further harm to the ex-wife (just one of the victims of Dick's abuse) and the child. If it had been my mom, sister, friend, I'd want someone to say something, and I was the only one who could do it. You can choose to believe me or not, but I sleep better knowing I spoke up.

My boyfriend (28m) and I (25f) have been together for over a year. We recently moved in together and we'd split chores equally. Cooking is outside of chores but I try to cook whrnever I find time and since he praises the food I make.



I'm in college and right now I'm preparing for my upcoming exams I can barely find time to shower let alone cook. He's been complaining about me not dedicating time towards cooking and has been giving a hard time about it. First it started with him begging me to stop studying to cook dinner, now he's almost demanding it saying I prioritize studying over his feelings.


Yesterday, he kept pestering me all day while he was working telling me he wanted me to make dinner. One of those elavted dinners I make in my free time. I refused but he kept texting and presisting. I've had enough of it. What I did was grab a basic cookbook from the store, place it in a plate then cover the plate with a lid and left it at the table then went back to studying.



He got back, found it instead of an actual dinner and went off on me saying I was ridiculing him and that I could've used the time an effort to cook an actual dinner instrad of acting so childishly and spitefully. We had an argument then he went to stay with his brother.

I feel lucky to have him in my life and didn’t think I’d ever deserve a guy like him. I sometimes poke him to make sure he is real. 

Over the time we’ve been dating, he’s opened up about how his dad is also a teacher like him and how weird it was going to high school and having girls tell him how hot his dad is. He’s also opened up about how he was cheated on by his ex fiancé. He’s also opened up how his dad was neglectful and harmful growing up to him and they don’t have the best relationship.

I met my boyfriends dad at a family wedding and his dad is wearing a three piece suit. Faded beard like my boyfriends but white hair. And this man looks like he could be in commercials/movies. He was wearing the suit not the suit wearing him.

My boyfriend laughed a little then drove to the reception. It’s been a week and I’ve noticed my boyfriend is very standoffish. I was supposed to drive him home after his hand tattoos and he got a friend to do it instead. 

I went to go kiss him one night and he kissed back half-heartedly then sort of dissociated and asked if we could do that some other time he “just wasn’t feeling it.” 

This morning I addressed it. Saying he’s been acting weird since the wedding, if something is wrong. He opened up and said that he noticed I’ve never called him sexy. “Adorable, yes. Handsome, yes. But not sexy. And I find it interesting you called my dad that… cause no woman I’ve brought home has done that before.” 

He then went to work in the garden and started hauling mulch sort of aggressively. I saw him cry for a moment outside from our bedroom window then wipe his eyes and then shake himself as if to shake it off. 

Was I in the wrong for making that comment? I just sort of day things sometimes without thinking especially if it feels true.

She was a very nice sweet girl, but she had history of being addicted to drugs, I stupidly ignored that and as weeks went by we started hanging out more and more up until 2 weeks ago. 2 weeks ago we got super drunk at her house. Me being the semi-responsible one in that situation I brought her to her bedroom to sleep where I met her sister (F12) I told her sister to take my drink so I could help my friend go to bathroom, which she made loads of banging noises and all of a sudden her step-father (M34) came out of his room and asked “why does she have guests over”. Me being the drunk one I didn’t respond, but her younger sister did saying “oh she just had some issues”. At that moment I realized I had to leave the house, so I did whilst being insanely drunk at 1am. The next day me and my friend decided to go to a pizza place at night which she asked me to bring alcohol. We met there at around 12am, ate pizza, and went to the bathroom to drink as long so she could hit her vape, we were only in there for about 10 minutes anyways, after we left the building we hugged said “I love you” and we both headed home. Fast forwarding over 2 weeks now I asked her “hey do you wanna hang out this weekend im not doing anything”. An hour later I get a text from her saying “Bro. U tried to drug me, ur going around running ur mouth sayin I’m a slut? Like Nahh , I got ur Fuckin nudes bro and it’s not that hard to press post come near me and I’ll smack tf outta u.” I was in actual shock and mad at her, I started balling my eyes out saying “huh I didn’t put oxy in your drink? I don’t even do drugs nor have a dealer or have anyone I know who does it. I also went on about how I never called her a slut which keep in mind I never did, and I don’t even use the word “slut” to make it worse she got my nudes from a guy I was “talking to”. I was so furious I blocked her on everything I had. The next day (today November 30, 2022)I get a text from a girl saying that I was talking smack about her? Which keep in mind I don’t talk to this girl at all! I explained to her that I didn’t say anything behind her back and that I didn’t want my name to be seen as “bad influence”. Literally 2 minutes later she responded back saying “Yeah no your good I’m more worried about the fact that person sent me your nudes, Ik ur not one to talk shit I’ve never heard ur name come up before so it’s odd it is now but girl please be careful with nudes n shit I’m v worried” so I replied with “thank you”.

For the past few months, I have been picking up my sister and brother from school. This works pretty well, it gives me time to bond with my siblings and helps my brother because he has sensory issues from autism and the bus is a bit much for him. He’s never been bullied at school, but the sensory issues on his bus can be quite bad, even on the “mini bus”. He operates pretty ok in school and day to day life and is actually quite extroverted and popular.

I was in school yesterday and got a text from my sister saying she needed to be picked up late due to getting a detention, and had detentions for the next several days, she didn’t tell me why she got detention. I thought this was odd, both of them have got in detention a few times in the past few months, and always tell me why, it’s usually something minor like talking in class or skipping class, not ok but nothing mean spirited. I ask her why and she said she didn’t want to talk about it. 

I then texted my brother to ask why she wouldn’t tell me the reason and why she was being so weird about it. When he told me why, it made sense. There is this boy in their grade, Ryder (13m). I know Ryder because I go to the lacrosse games sometimes for the middle school and Ryder is on the team. I also sometimes volunteer at the games for honor society credit, I’ve interacted with Ryder a few times and he seems like a nice dude. 

Ryder truly loves lacrosse, and decided to buy stud earrings of lacrosse sticks. He’s been posting about them on his Instagram story and was wearing them in school. My sister and her friends thought it would be hilarious to call him gay for doing this and made fun of him. Ryder and his friends told the teacher what had happened, when the teacher decided to discipline her, she only made it worse by defending her actions. 

I was disgusted to hear this, especially because we do have a cousin (14m) who is actually gay. I texted my sister and told her she could take the late bus, as I wouldn’t wait for her this time. She got mad at me saying she didn’t want to go on the bus, especially because kids could make fun of her for being mean to him. Ryder is a very popular kid at her school and she clearly hurt her social status by bullying him.

I get a text from our mom a bit after texting my sister telling me I should pick her up and that she’s already got in trouble from her mistakes, however our dad texted me saying she need to learn these are “natural consequences” of bullying and she can use the late bus. This is even weirder to me because my dad is the less strict parent usually. I didn’t pick her up and my parents are telling me conflicting feelings on what I did. Today was her second day of detention, and I didn’t pick her up again.

Since they've gotten back together, we've sexted several times, he's started calling me mommy, and sends me shirtless pics. In my book, this is considered cheating, even though we haven't had sex since we broke up.

I apologise in advance for my broken English.

So, today I (32f) was walking my two dogs through my neighborhood when I got near a house where two old women were sitting inside. I know them from sight and never had a problem with them, but an old man that I don't know was sitting outside the house. The sidewalk is narrow and he was occupying half of it, so if I was to walk through the sidewalk my dogs would be too close to him. Now my dogs don't attack people, they are very tame dogs in fact, but they're big and I don't want to take any risks thus I never let them get too close from other people. So when we got closer to the house, I went right to the street, this way putting a distance betwen the old man and my dogs.

That street is very busy and I didn't want to risk getting hit by a car so we went back to the sidewalk as soon as we passed the man. As we did that, we came to a trash bag that was left in the sidewalk, still in front of the house. I don't understand why it was there, where I live people usually have garbage bins outside their houses to keep the trash away from the ground (there was an empty garbage bin in front of that house btw), plus the garbage truck won't come until next Friday morning. 

Anyway, I guess the smell of the trash bag attracted my dogs, as they started to sniffle it. They didn't do anything to the trash bag, the only thing they did was sniffle in silence and it didn't took more than a minute, when I heard the old man screaming behind me in an angry voice ""don't let the dogs pee in the bag"". I tried to explain in a calm voice that they weren't peeing, only sniffling the trash bag but the old man screaming to get the dogs away.
 
I started to move away with my dogs, while still trying to explain that my dogs weren't messing with the trash bag nor were they peeing on it, but the old man got up and started walking to us, yelling to ""get this danmed breed away from here"". 

I don't know what he meant by that, but I guess he mistook my labrador for a pitbull (I love pitties but some people hate them)? In any case, I was already pissed at this point and angrilly replied that my dogs weren't peeing, just sniffling the bag. He screamed again and I, who was already a few meters away, repeated the same thing in a louder, angry voice (I didn't scream, but spoke pretty loud). I then decided to ignore him and kept walking away. 

Now that I'm calmer, I'm kind feeling bad for arguing with an old man. I don't know if he's in his right mind and I think I'd just ignore him from the get go, but at the same time I don't think I was wrong for defending my dogs.

My wife and I got married days ago. She's refusing to speak to me right now saying I'd embarrassed her and her family because of what I did.



I'm a dog owner. I've fostered many dogs in my lifetime and every single one of thrm was special to me. But 7 of them hold a place in my heart because they've spent a lifetime with me and because they're now deceased. I grew up without a family and I might be crazy for saying this but those dogs were like family to me.


I had made custom enamal pins with their photos and decided to wear them on my suit jacket. My then fiancee thought it was a crazy idea and tried to convince me to just go with the traditions and wear flower pins or something but I refused. One of the reasons why is because this way, I get to feel their presence as my family in the wedding. She thought it was ridiculous and even tried to get my friends to talk me out of it but I refused.


I ended up wearing the pins to the wedding and she blew up at me later saying I embarrassed her and her family and made the day all about my dogs. In my defense, they were just tiny little pins and hold sentimental value but she's refusing to speak to me and says it's my fault. My friend said I fucked up.

My husband (M39) and I (F32) have been married for 6 years. I am Jewish, he's not. We got two daughters, F5 and F3 and we are raising them Jewish but with access to his family's culture, so they do participate on stuff like Christmas. His family has adapted well to embracing our faith and customs, too. My problem isn't Christmas.

My MIL(63) and FIL(64) have been divorced for a few years now and my MIL even has a boyfriend (68) now, my daughters think he is their grandpa, and he is like a surrogate father to my husband and his brothers.

I have a good relationship with them, I think he is a good grandpa. I don't get along with is FIL. We've fought in a few occasions, verbally, and I was glad to not have heard about him since he left to do whatever he was doing in the last few years.

The reason I don't like him is because when my husband was a teen his mum had cancer and was very ill for a long time. FIL emotionally abandoned the family after that. My husband was pushed to care for his brothers (M34 and M29) and do anything a parent would do. He fed them, cleaned them, took them to school, helped with homework, took them to doctor's appointments... all of it while caring for his mother. FIL didn't move a single finger and even mistreated my husband when he did anything ""wrong"". MIL recovered and the family dynamic went back to whatever was normal-ish for them.

Recently, FIL came back and wants to be a part of his kids' lives again, and that includes being in my daughters' lives too.

Here is the reason I'm writing this post. He is going to be at Christmas this year, and I already talked to my husband about me not being present. He respects my position and I know he can care for our daughters on his own, he is a god parent.

It makes me sad to not be there with them because I think it is important that F5 and F3 have memories with their family, but I also think it is more important that they don't have memories of their mother cursing at their grandfather during a fight that could be avoided by keeping us away from one another (FIL knows how to rile me up and is happy to do it).

My husband respects his father and doesn't think ill of him even after the years of mistreatment In fact, he was the one who asked his family to let FIL participate in Christmas because he wants and deserves a second chance.

I'm not feeling comfortable having my daughters there with FIL. I don't think he is going to mistreat them, but I don't want them to see my husband's weird dynamic with his father and think that it is normal! I don't want them to be there without me, I don't want to be there, and I don't want them to miss the family reunion!

I want to talk with my husband about not having the girls at Christmas, and making it up for New Year's Eve (without FIL). WIBTA if I asked him to attend it without our daughters?

When I was younger my sister and I would go and get photos taken with santa at the local shops, something I/we havent done for a few years now. I don't like these photos, I feel awkward and they weirdly make me feel anxious, especially if my parents use them as holiday letters. 
This year, for my little brother's second christmas my parents wanted all three of us to go and get a photo again, which I've been resistant about. It's not that I just don't want to get the photo done because I can't be bothered, I actively do not want to get that photo. 
Coming up to this morning my parents pushed it with ""it'll be fun"" ""it'll be cute"" ""do it for us"" etc, and as guilty as I feel for it, this morning I decided I wouldn't come. This really upset my dad and his mood has been sour all morning and he's said things like ""well I don't have to pick you up at 12 o clock when I'm tired but we all do things we don't want to do"" which I suppose he has a point about, but considering I havent gone and had a photo with santa for the last five or so years I didn't realise this was that big of a deal, especially because I feel like I've massively outgrown it by now. 
While getting ready to go this morning my parents had that sort of annoyed tone and were yelling at people to hurry up to leave in time and the sort which was really stressing me out, and I sat frozen on my bed entirely conflicted. I haven't moved and they've just left the house, so now I'm home alone crying softly on my bed. Am I the asshole?? I feel like I made the wrong decision and may seem like I'm overreacting a bit, but it really was weirdly stressing me out, and now I feel like this whole thing has dampened my mood for the whole day, ive lost motivation to do anything. 
However I do think it's kinda fair that eventually teenagers shouldn't have to participate in santa photos after a point, and regardless I always spend the holiday with my family.

This happened two years ago. Everyday I go to school, come back with a lot of homework as I am in a prep school. I go to my room, shut the door, and do my homework. Once I finish, I usually play games, watch TV, or look at the Upcoming Twitter Drama, etc. After a while. My parents usually go through my door without even knocking. Which I had a sign on my door that says Knock Before Entering. I tell them both to always knock so I wont be scared. Of course, they never do. So I decided to use my lock instead. Well, that's when my dad comes in.

My dad was in the military, and he knows a lot of things. But the main thing is he knows how to pick a lock. So instead of knocking, he picks my lock and breaks in. WITHOUT EVEN KNOCKING. I told them both again the same thing. KNOCK. BEFORE. ENTERING. I ordered a unpickable lock that goes through the side of the door and a few weeks later, it came. I set it up and guess what? He knocks on the door! So I opened the door, he comes in, with his tools to take my door off. He told be that you aren't going to have a door anymore. I asked why. He stated that they need to know what I'm doing all the time. So I asked him if he is just going to revoke my privacy. He didn't answer. and threw it in the trash.

Two years later (Present Day) I decided to confront them about this, using any piece of evidence I could find. From Quora, Google, etc. Telling them that removing my door gives emotional abuse, and removes my privacy. They decided to still say no, and told me that they always need to know what I'm doing. Both of them did. AITA for confronting my parents to get my door back?

I'm 15F and I still live with my mom and my ""stepfather"", both are very much assholes. I have a simple job at Mcdonald's and I love working there. I just started about 2 weeks ago.

So, we were originally located in another city, but we moved recently. (I'll call them City A - CA and City B - CB)

Back in CA, I had amazing grades. A few A's, a couple B's, and a C. That was because I was happier there. I had a boyfriend nearby and a few friends nearby and we could all see each other during lunch and sometimes in the hall or class. And the work wasn't hard at all amd I also got to move around a lot because of my 8 periods.

Now in CB, I despise it here. I have no friends nearby or anything. And I only have 4 periods so I don't get to move around a lot and the work is so fucking hard. I would literally trade my soul in to the devil to go back to CA.

The reason we moved to CB is because my stepdad bought a house here so there was no reason to live in CA anymore. (I still believe is was money problems.)

So, to the main story.
Because of my depression and unhappiness because I moved from CA my grades are shit. I don't have motivation to do anything because of it. I, however, managed to land a job and have been maintaining that well. But my mom decided that if I don't fix my grades she's going to make me quit my job. Which will NOT look good on my career in the long run. It'd be harder for me to get a job again and maybe even keep it.

I feel like my mom is being the asshole here, though I also feel like I'm being the asshole by not maintaining my grades. I'm not doing it on purpose btw, I just struggle and no one helps.

My mom (59f) was never the best at cleaning, and her methods leave a lot to be desired (using Kaboom bathroom tile spray to sanitize kitchen counters is one that comes to mind). She places handfuls of dry food down for her cat all over the house because “the cat doesn’t like to eat from a bowl”.  My mom also owns one of the most consistently disgusting refrigerators you’ll ever see. At least 3-5 containers of rotten food, open halves of black (no, not even brown) avocados, smears of condiments on the shelving. She pretty consistently does dishes, which is one of the only redeeming qualities of her cleaning strategy. 

Well, my SO (24f) and I visited her from Wednesday-Friday for Thanksgiving, and I’m always embarrassed to take her there to visit, even after nearly 7 years together. Well, while visiting, here is a list of things that happened:

- My SO moved an old shirt of mine out of the way in the guest room and a ton of dry cat food fell out of it.
- I found a plastic wrapper to an ice cream bar wedged in between the couch cushions (the wrapper was visible, I didn’t go hunting for it or anything).
- My mom stacked dishes with decent amounts of leftover Thanksgiving food in the sink.
- She let’s her Brita filter/pitcher go unwashed, to the point where it gets flecks of black mold and larger orange-ish splotches of mold
- General dust bunnies and collections of cat fur littered the hardwood floors and area rug.
- THE FRIDGE (bain of my existence)
- She sleeps in the guest room most nights because she “cannot handle the cat waking her up in the middle of the night”, so she has made the guest room her second room. It’s cluttered with random shit, some of her clothes, and more random dry cat food.

This is all AFTER she claimed that she cleaned her place for 3 days straight. I made a request that she clean her Brita filter this time, and she seemed to be offended by that (mentioning how she performed my “special request” several times). I get the sense that she would be angry with me if I brought up all the points above. I haven’t said anything about the whole system being broken and disgusting, but as time passes I am feeling like I have to.

I won’t be sharing any personal things like age all that besides my name Anyways let’s start the rant! 

First it started off with her continuously making fun of my body (im not insecure about it) it’s just seriously annoying calling me flat. She’s extremely self centered always thinking she’s better than everyone and she’s extremely hot. Her thinking she’s hot isn’t bad what’s bad is that she puts everyone else down so she can think so. This is where it really gets bad, She starts off saying how ugly we are (in a group chat with a different cousin) and how flat and small we are and how we’re TO skinny which we are perfectly average. No I am not fatphobic which I don’t mind you being overweight at all but what I do mind is you making everyone else think their weight is bad and you are the only correct one. Continuing on a little later on we have a fight within the same cousin we will call her Lia the problem maker we shall call Mia. 

Let’s continue, As I said we got into another fight and she realized she was losing what does she do? She says she has mental illnesses (She DOESNR) if she did it has nothing to do with what we were talking about no it wasn’t bipolar she said adhd and ocd which she doesnt. Not the worst part she said she wanted to die. NOT TRUE AT ALL it was a defense card to make us feel bad.


Another thing.

Mia went to my house for a party and I asked her to please just clean up what mess she makes she doesn’t so my friends see it to and politely asked her to help and we will as well. I go downstairs to see her fake crying hiding her face. This starts a huge commotion and she ruins a party once again something she’s ruined for me. 

Next day after that.

There’s this girl which we have never been on good terms context: She’s told me to off myself and my family etc etc. I can do a story on her but she was bullying her online but when she goes home she wanted to be her friend all the sudden and make me seem like an ahole and I forced her to do it which he took my phone and refused to give it back.


I won’t tell the other story’s since it’s basically her lying over and over again 


Basically she would make me do something and make it seem as if I had the plan i was her puppet under her control.

Another thing she would go in my phone and text lia saying stuff like don’t talk to me anymore I don’t like you making it seem like I’m being rude to her she also try’s to go through my phone. Continuing on to the end


One day I had enough and I deleted her everywhere because she was causing to much commotion between me and everybody I still see her but I try to stay away but I’ve been forced back into contact her.
