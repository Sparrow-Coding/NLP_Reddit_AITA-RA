We had some artwork designed to be embroidered into the back by an artist friend of one of the other committee members, the artist at the time identified as female.  The jackets came up amazingly but I only wore it a couple of times and it just takes up space.

I decided to offer it to members of the community associated with the event as I remembered at the time several people were interested on how to get their hands on one of the jackets.  I placed a message online saying what the jacket was and I happened to mention the name of the artist.

Unbeknownst to me, between 2010 and now, the artist has transitioned and now identifies by another name.  I have basically been out of the community since my involvement back in 2010 and was only at best a fleeting acquaintance of the artist and was unaware of their new name as I had never followed them and they had moved internationally.

Since posting the offer to sell the jacket I have received a number of rather nasty PM’s berating me for Deadnaming the artist and that I am being ”rude”, “Insensitive” and even acting like a TERF.

I did update the post with the artists new name as soon as I was made aware of it, but still people have flagged me for my inappropriateness

He guessed our grades. My classmate that transferred also had grades, so I was aware of it.

I consulted him about my grades at the cookery lab and asked if there was a way to increase it, he said ""No, we're already in the second quarter"".

I have full attendance and "" and he said ""Grades aren't counted in skill based subjects, so we don't count that"", that enraged and said ""Then you should have taught us/Then you should teach us"" and he said ""okay"".

I picked my bag and said ""I'm really going to leave sir!"", I left the classroom and on the window I shouted ""You're a worthless teacher!"". My classmate of that subject shouted at me back ""Hey!

I've tried waiting for a break in conversation to change the subject but she manages to bring things back to her. We have a lot of fun when we actually go out and do something but if we're just hanging out at her house or mine then things get a little difficult on my end. 

The other thing that she tends to do a lot is talk about pregnancy, birth and babies. I have told her that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to have children of my own because I have hormone issues and I've tried before with no luck. She still continues to talk quite frequently about how incredible it is to feel a baby's first kick or when you first see how tiny their little feet and hands are. I don't want to censor her or make her feel bad about talking about her kids but it does hurt hearing so much about about something that I may never experience. I have no problem hearing about what her kids are currently doing. It's just hearing about all of the baby and pregnancy stuff. 

The last straw was when I went over to her house for my birthday. She got some pizza and put up balloons for me which was really nice and I appreciated it. That was the end of her doing anything nice for me though. She never once asked me about myself while I was there. Not about my day, my week, or anything. She took two long phone calls with her mom and one of which was about how her brothers girlfriend just got pregnant. Then she went on about pregnancy again and how she wants to have another child so she can see their tiny feet again.

I didn't have a bag with me. 

I went in only intending to get a large bag of flour. I found the bag of flour which was very heavy. I suffer from really bad nerve pain and sciatica in my arms and legs and knew that I wouldn't be able to hold it without pain while crouching up and down. I realised there was one other thing I wanted so I placed the bag of flour on the customer checkout counter. There was someone else checking out — and I made sure to place the bag as far away from the customer's stuff — across from a pamphlet rack on the desk which acted as a divider.  The other customer was quite old and taking the time to have a long chat with the checkout lady — which is fine — but I knew I couldn't hold the flour for that long without pain. I met eyes with the checkout assistant and gave her a nod while placing the flour on the desk before bending down to look for something on a close-by shelf.  

The previous customer took a while going over a story and I took a while to find the other thing (maybe about five minutes) — by which time the checkout lady had forgotten and asked the older customer if the flour was his — I chimed in and said: ""oh sorry, no that's mine I'll be one minute.""

I don't think I had really put anyone out or been especially rude.

We’ve been friends since primary school. When we first got together I was in Graduate school and he was working full time. During this time, I did all the duties of a SAH partner. I cleaned everything, I cooked all the meals, I did laundry, shopped for groceries, did all his shopping, managed money and paid bills, etc. I also put student loans into our collective bills if I had left over. He worked 8-16 hour shifts at a hospital. He gets sick during the pandemic and stopped working. At this time, the doctors don’t know what’s wrong and he is unable to return to work. 

I get a full time job and start my practicum. I finish my degree, get a job in my field and become successful in my career for the stage I am at. 

Over the years, he had ups and downs with health. We discussed chores and responsibilities. There has some push back chores and communication. When I try to talk to him about anything important He will either physically leave the room we are in or he will shut down. I am still doing 70% of all the household chores and working full time. Even though a more balanced system was agreed on. It’s come to a point where he is not trying at all over than a few chores around the house. If I ask him to do anything fun or social he refuses. 

A few weeks ago he’s gotten an official diagnosis and it’s going to be manageable with medications.

With holidays coming up we we’re invited to my friend’s house, my family’s house (x2 different states but welcome in either him), and his family’s house. 

I told him that I would be willing to drive 7 hours to go his parents house so he can see his family for the first time years. He refused to answer until I gave him a time frame “I need an answer by Saturday”. He finally said no. He also refused to go to any other holiday event.

I told him I would be going to my friend’s house and my family’s house (both live less than 5 minutes away from my house) on Thursday with the single dish (tamales) I had planned to take to any of the gatherings we attended. He is still invited. He refused. 

After talking I found out he wanted me to make the entire thanksgiving meal just for us… in less than a week to prepare. I refused and said that he could do it if he really wanted to have the meal at our house. I told him I would buy everything and do the shopping and that he just needed to make a list, prepare it, and cook it. He agreed. It’s now Tuesday. He has yet to give me any sort of list or plan.

Yesterday, I had a lenghty whatsapp chat with a banker. Since morning. Nearly 5 pm, he asked me to contact my other bank to enquire some transactions. I told him the bank is already closing, I would call tomorrow. After that, I put phone A into silent mode, stashed it into my bag and drove home. I went about my usual routine without checking phone A. Around 11 pm, I took out phone A to charge it, 27 misscalls and 23 messages from said banker. 

This morning I replied to his texts, he said I was an AH for not answering his calls. He said he worked overtime to finish my case, he needed the info from the other bank. Told him again the bank was closed, he should've waited until morning for me to make the call. He bombarded me with more nasty things. 

Told my friend, she said I was kinda AH since I wasted his time waiting for my input. She said the point of having a mobile phone is for people to easily reach us when needed. 27 calls mean he needed things urgently. I told her I dont really care, she called me AH.

Viola was selling us the house &amp; moving out of state. Before she moved, she let Sally’s bf of 1 month to move in. He, ”John”, just came from out of state for work &amp; was a total stranger to us.I was upset Viola let a stranger move in to the house we were about to buy without even asking. The night before she moved, she put herself into a convo that was only supposed to include me, my wife, John &amp; Sally. John wanted to tell us his backstory &amp; for us to give him a chance, which I respected him for doing.

Knowing Viola’s record with her bad temper, I decided to tape the conversation for my protection. &amp; it’s important to know that my wife did not know of this recording. Long story short, we were kicked out of the house by Viola that night. Luckily things didn’t get too crazy so I never had to use the recording. But I showed it to my best friend who helped us move out that night.

Not only did Viola move out of state but so did Sally &amp; John. I deleted the tape &amp; we all leave that story in the past. Sally and John have since moved back to our home town this summer. But the one friend I showed the tape to back in 2014 let it slip that there was a secret recording of that night. John was angry that he was in the tape. For a week, John stewed &amp; didn’t tell me. He told Sally, who was enraged and told Viola that I recorded the conversation.

John finally confronted me over the phone and was rightfully upset. I apologized for sharing it &amp; assured him that it no longer exists &amp; nothing like that has happened since. He understood my reason for the tape (he has had problems with Viola since that night), and I thought that was it, but he didnt warn me that Sally &amp; Viola knew. 

The next day was bad. Viola insulted me which was no surprise but she demeaned my wife who was innocent. I told her to be mad at me alone, and I was fully responsible. I told her that I know that this information is new to her so it feels fresh, but all of it is deep in the past. She never apologized to her daughter that she insulted for no reason at all. I hadn’t heard my wife cry like that in a long time.

I am upset how Sally handled this incident. I understand that it’s new to them, but it’s wrong that she set up the stage for my wife to be insulted by Viola when she had 0% to do with my actions. Viola’s reaction was as predictable as the sun rising in the morning, but we had no idea it was coming and they should have said something. Or they should have given me the opportunity to explain myself to Viola. Sally doesn’t think what she did was wrong, and says that you should never record family. The thing is, I know that she has taped John during their arguments &amp; shared them. Doing the exact thing she is upset with me for.

I do about 95% of the housework, juggling doing things is patches while taking care of a baby.  Yesterday my wife worked from home because she was “too tired” to go into the office. Which is fine except it means she was doing work calls in the main part of the house so I couldn’t do housework while the baby napped.   
A new high chair arrived and she started taking it out to assemble while the house was a disaster. I recommended ordering food cause I could tell she wanted to put it together and if I made dinner she would have to keep pausing for the baby.  2 hours go by and it’s getting late so I ask if she can just keep on eye on the baby so I can get started on getting some bottles clean cause there is only 1 left. She snapped at me that she wants to finish it that unless I want her to just leave it and not finish it till tomorrow after work and leave the garbage all over the floor.  
Shortly after the baby needed to go to bed and the last bottle.  After she was asleep I put the camera on her and went down to start cleaning at 11pm(our baby is a night owl).  She woke up so I came upstairs but she fell back asleep without me doing anything.  As I was leaving she came up and I told her there was no clean bottles.  There were dirty ones in the room and the ability to wash them upstairs.

When I got up there, I was told she assumed I would bring one right up as soon as left(again there wasn’t any clean downstairs either).

I gave up and got up. BF immediately turned the game off and then a while later put LO to bed.

There are some spoilers here from the last episode, just sayin.\]

This is about The Walking Dead. I first started watching it almost 9 years ago, in late 2014. I didn't really have a lot of close friends, so this show helped me through a lot of things. It gave me something to care about, to love. Always the new episodes, something to look forward to. I can't really explain it. But it was and will always be something very special and important to me.

So now about my parents, they seperated also around the year 2014. I didn't really love that. But again TWD helped me a lot to be happy in that time and just live my life. My dad started to watch the show in between august and november of 2021(he watched it alone until somewhere in the middle of season 11). And my mom started the show in februari 2022, I watched it again from the beginning. I always try and rewatch it every year, just cuss it brings me peace.

When we came close to the last episode my mom and dad decided to watch it with the 3 of us together on release. I was kinde not sure if I wanted to, but my mom really wanted me with her for the finale. So we did, but I got annoyed already a few times. I'll describe my mom for you guys: she asks like a LOT of questions during an episode (while I haven't even seen the episode myself), she always forgets so many characters (like she forgot who Luke, Magna and Jerry were), she complains a lot about things like ""why don't they just do this"" or "" Why are there so many walkers all of a sudden""....

And when the time the episode was done they both were like ""this is a terrible ending"", ""we could have written it WAY better"", ""This is such a bad show ending"", ""Have I been watching 11 season for this crap"" or they were talking through so many things like Rosita's death, the incredible ending scenes. Normally if I had watched it alone I would def have been crying the entire episode. But I just couldn't with them doin these things. When it ws done I just went to my room and cried my eyes out for prob almost a full hour.

This show just has and will always have a place in my heart, I fellt like I was part of that big family.

I also tried to email her the official documentations and explanation as to why I couldn't do that and would need to sit if it was for that long. There was only silence...

I f(33) lost my mother back in August 2020 and my father June 2022. I met my partner m(35) at the end of March 2022. Prior to losing my father, we got along fine. When I met him, I was pretty clear and communicative on my emotional progress in terms with grief and depression. However, when my father passed, I suggested that we separate because I didn't want to drag anyone down with me. I know for sure that I couldn't give anything into the relationship anymore and it'll be unfair for him to stay and deal with such negativity and emotional baggages. He insisted on staying after multiple discussions of us going back and forth as to how I cannot give my all into a relationship right now and him saying he'll be patient. 2 months after my father's passing, we got into our first argument (I had a breakdown and drove to Yosemite to sit in nature; I admit it's my fault for not telling him the night I left but I texted him as soon as I got signal in the morning.) He was understandably upset when I came back 2 days later. He asked me why I'm not better since it's already been 2 months? Why am I chosing to be depressed? I asked him if he thinks I just sit in my room and think of ways to be depressed and he answered yes. That day of the argument was also my mom's 2 years death anniversary so I was a bit emotional from that as well. He proceeded to ask me why am I not over it since it's been 2 years and will I be like this with my dad 2 years down the road? I honestly don't even know how to feel except anger. This man was in the same room with me after pulling the plug on my dad and watching him die. I blew up on him and pretty much cussed him out for being dismissive and unsympathetic. However, I know it's also very difficult to be around someone who's grieving and constantly negative. I'm highly emotional/sensitive and don't want to think in this state of mind. I think I'm the idiot bc I haven't been contributing to our relationship as much as he wants; he says he can't even treat me like a normal person anymore and I feel horrible that this situation is unfair for him.

Historically, when my sister has been pretty broke, she will buy little gifts for people from the dollar store. Usually, the gifts are useless junk that i dont want/need/have a use for.

All of those items, except the cup which i still use, kind of sat around in boxes until an acceptable amount of time passed and they got thrown out during a deep clean. I am not a person who likes stuff that just sits around my house with no purpose. Ill hang cool art, but thats mostly it. I would say my sister has given me gifts like this 4 or 5 times in the past.

It seems every little noise we make sets my downstairs neighbor into a frenzy where they just throw stuff and bang the walls. Which seems crazy to me because I can't imagine me having hygiene and a social life is so loud they can't do anything, when our neighbors on 3 sides have parties 3-5 out of the 7 days a week.

I’ve been with my partner for 8 years. He has 2 children from a previous relationship, 16 and 13. I don’t have children of my own through choice. 

My partner and his ex don’t have the best of co-parenting relationships. It’s constant squabbling and their main squabble is always about money. Unfortunately, their children always fall in the middle of their arguments, despite them constantly being told to not involve them. 

So, for the past 8 years I’ve always stood as neutral ground for their children, always ensuring they don’t miss out and have emotional support for when their parents fell out. I’ve made sure they got things they’ve wanted when their parents could not get their sh*t together and go half on an expensive purchase or whatever it was the children wanted or needed. 

One of the children moved in with us for a few years because the situation was quite toxic with her mother. Her mother left her with nothing, so I bought everything she needed, clothes, shoes, school uniform and even her sanitary products. I ensured she was fed, a roof was over her head and still offered emotional support and guidance for whenever she wanted it. When her sister would be with us for her week (there is a shared arrangement) again I would offer the same, ensuring she had clothes, food and support. Again, funded by myself and not their parents. 

Every year I have bought them their birthday and Christmas presents, I have always made a big deal when it’s their birthday or an achievement. The eldest had her prom, her parents could not be mature enough and go halves on a dress she wanted. So muggins here bought it, no offer from either parent to pay me back and that dress was not cheap, it set me back a cool £500. 

Well it’s come to my birthday. Neither child has acknowledged it, for a second year in a row. To be honest, I have seen my backside about it. As this has made me feel really under valued. Considering everything I’ve done for them over the years. I’m not their mother and I didn’t have to do all the things I have done for them, but I did as it made me feel awful seeing them get caught up in their parent BS and knowing they would always miss out because of them. I’ve been raised to never let stuff like that happen if I can do something about it. I’ve stood strong with my upbringing and morals. 

I said to my partner that this year I am not working all the hours god sends to ensure they get a decent Christmas and not am I doing the same for their birthdays anymore, they’ll get a card and that’s it. I said to him I am not getting anything they need anymore and I won’t be buying food for when they stay. They are his and his exes responsibility and therefore they need to step up. He said I am being unreasonable as they are kids. I said to him they are old enough to understand what respect and appreciation is and why should I be the one to pick up the pieces because him and his ex can’t swallow their pride and be parents to their kids?

he promised me he wouldn't do anything with another girl. 
then we both started crying and then we fell asleep, when we woke up he packed his things and went to his house. right after he got home i got a message the he was going over to a friends house.

eventually he stayed with that friend and they went drinking, two girls who also came to drink but one of those girls likes my boyfriend.

I had hardly heard anything all night, only small short messages now and then. 
the next morning he texted me that he really misses me a lot and wants to come back and come to my house so ofc i let him come. 
then he told me the story of what he had experienced that night and what that girl had said to him. I felt that he was just not telling the whole story. 
he also hides his phone from me now and acts a bit weird. 
when I told him I think it's a bit suspicious he told me not to be so jealous and not to overreact. Then we got into an argument and he walked out the door angrily.

My BF and I are staying with she and my dad for Thanksgiving.

As soon as we get off the plane Mom is complaining about the airport traffic. 

Then we go to dinner and she starts in on how red my eyes are. She won't let the matter drop. (I was sitting in a dark plane, playing games on a screen. Yeah, they're going to be a little red or tired). My boyfriend looks at them, confused, and says they're a little red, but not that bad. I look and agree. They're not near what she's making them out to be.

Think to note is that Mom complains. A lot. About everything. It's tiring to listen to.

So cut to the next day (last night). She and I are in the family room talking and soon she gets ready to launch into some complaint about my dad having to deal with the cell phone people. I laughed casually and, keeping my tone as light as I can, start to say ""I don't want to know"" but it instead comes out - ""I don't want to hear about it."" Fraudian slip, probably, but, I mean, I'm not lying.

She gets really quiet and for the rest of the night gives one word answers and soon leaves the room, not coming back. After my slip I continued to act casual with her, like it was just a breezing comment, but I know it hurt her feelings.

I'm just so tired of it. She had been making little complaints throughout the day and by the evening I was just over it.

My partner and I have a large group of friends/acquaintances who work in hospitality who hang out regularly in varying combinations. 

Myself (32f), my partner Reuben (27m) and two friends Sam (30m) and Austin (27m) went to a party to celebrate an acquaintance, Amelie’s venue opening. 

Amelie (29f) has a roommate, Elle (30f). They are both from China and are living and working in our city. Elle’s English is still developing (this is important). Austin, who is white and single, ended up spending a lot of the party chatting and dancing with Elle. I found out that he got her number and plans to ask her out. 

The problem is, Austin has what I am beginning to think is an unhealthy pattern of developing crushes on only East Asian women. In the 6 months we have known him, he has expressed feelings towards 5 different Asian women (and no women of other races), including 3 who he works with. He has had a casual sexual relationship with one of those co-workers, and is currently avoiding conversation with her. Another current crush is his co-worker, and previous crush’s roommate (a different person to Elle), who has come to our city to learn English. 

I’m wondering if I will be the asshole if I tell Amelie about Austin’s pattern, which would probably ruin his chances with Elle, as I know Amelie would be concerned to hear this and would want to protect her friend. As a woman I feel like I’d like to know this information about someone I’m thinking about dating.

I currently work at a major airport, performing safety inspections and minor repairs on aircraft. I was finishing my shift and there was a holding room for people who had issues with documentations, security risks or had issues on the plane. There was an old lady who kept trying to speak to them in Hungarian. They told her in Portuguese that she'll have to wait until the next day when they can get a certified Romanian translator to come. I asked the lady whats wrong and she said her son is waiting for her and if they can meet they can clarify the issue. The staff were not at all sympathetic, they made jokes about Romania and otherwise just didn't seem to care that some 70+ year old lady was going to be stuck here. 

I translated for the lady and the staff just said ""you are not a certified translator, we can't take what your word as fact, i dont want to deal with it"" and they told me to leave. I told htem no and that they should have some more compassion. They said I'm not a Romanian translator so shut the fuck up.

Then in highschool, Jessy came back and all three of us became friends. 
The red flags started when they would stare at me and laugh when I would ask,
""What's so funny?"" And they'd always say oh it's nothing. We had a throwback weekend for HOCO and i dressed up, (it was decades dance), and I dressed up for all days, and I would get the dirtiest looks and get mad fun of. 
Anyways, so that happened, then Tammy came to school crying over something, and everyone knew except me. Well then Jessy told me, I had to practically bribe her to tell me. She said that Tammy had slept with her bus driver that gave her vapes and weed, he was 22, she was underaged (freshman.) And I told Tammy what Jessy told me to get some clarity, and Tammy said that what she told me was all incorrect. But then the bus driver was kicked off the bus, now some old dude drives it now.

Before my current relationship, I was in a relationship with with my ex for almost 8 years (age 17-25) and engaged for 3 of them. We were HS sweethearts and grew up together. We eventually grew apart due to long distance and career choices as we developed into adults. When we split up things were a little messy like any other break up but there was no real animosity or suspicion of foul play. (Or at least how I felt about it.)

My current gf and I started darting a couple months after and we both had breakups around the same time. Hers was messy because he was caught cheating so she deleted and destroyed every last photo and gift he bought her. 

When we first started dating she requested that I unfollow her from all social media. I did for all except Facebook because I felt that that was the most appropriate one to keep since there was no hard feelings and in the future and from a friends perspective I would be interested in knowing how her life is going.

After unfollowing my ex on all other social medias. My current gf requested I also delete all photos of her(ex) and I. I told her(gf) politely that hers(gf) and I’s previous relationships ended in two completely different ways and for two completely different reasons and that I do not think it is appropriate for anyone to tell someone else who they can and cannot have on their social media. 

I also explained to her(gf) that I am not going to delete them because in the moment of the picture, I was happy, and I believe that if you take a picture with the intention of deleting it than the picture is not worth taking. And I believe it to be toxic and an overreaction to delete pictures immediately after a breakup. I then explained my point of view that I see my social media as an archive of MY life. No one else’s. There may be other people on it but this is mine. Of course from ages 17-25 pictures and posts will contain my ex but that’s what my life looked like during that time. 

I believe that social media is a method to document our lives. (The same way people had photo albums or journals). I don’t want to completely erase a decade worth and a huge chapter of my life so far just because she deleted hers. I told her that I thought deleting them is an unhealthy coping mechanism and pretending it didn’t happen is worse than owning it, acknowledging it existed, and moving forward. 

Now that we have been together for sometime now she still brings it up. She apparently has talked to many friends and family about it and they tell her I should have already deleted them. And she sends me many articles about deleting and blocking my ex.

I am a young black man who recently started his locs journey. I just got my hair twisted into “starter coils” about a week ago. She is a white woman with thick, but pin straight hair.

When she started doing the twisting, at first I was a little confused, but then she started insisting that she was doing it because she was bored. I guess that’s when my face turned sour. 

She asked me what was wrong, and I tried to brush it off multiple times, but she kept insisting she could see it on my face. She asked me “do you want me to stop curling my hair?” My reply was along the lines of “I’m not sure if asking you to stop is rational or justified, so I wanted to keep it to myself until I unpack how I feel”  She immediately took off the headband, and let her hair down. 

My thought process is that she was “inspired,” so to speak, by my new look. My hair has always been important to me, and my curls have always been a source of ire from inside my own home (colorism) and my community. So this journey I’m on is about more than hair to me, it’s about spiritual growth and unlearning a lot of internalized racism. So, to see what I would say, is a farce of my journey happening before my eyes, rubbed me the wrong way.

I commissioned an artist here on Reddit on November 1st. I was clear in my original post that the piece was supposed to be a Christmas gift, and that I would need to send it off to be printed as a canvas. So I was commissioning early so that I would have time to have that done.

I was approached by an artist and, after looking at her beautiful portfolio, asked for a price and how long it would take to complete. I was quoted $100 and a week and a half. That sounded perfect to me, and she sent me a rough sketch on November 3rd. I approved it and sent her the $50 deposit she required. I haven't heard from her since.

So, here's my issue. I emailed her on November 20th to ask how the project was progressing and as of today have not received a reply. I'm beginning to get antsy thinking that I'm being ghosted, and even if I'm not is my piece going to be done in time to have it printed before Christmas? I wouldn't mind if she needed a little more time, but if she doesn't communicate that then I don't want to wait too long and then not have time to find another artist.

We met at first-year high school. I was the introverted kid who always sat in the corner, a total nobody; while she was a ray of sunshine, all eyes were on her, which is understandable. She's rich, and Einstein-level intelligent, participating in quiz bees and being a pride of our school. Then there is this new guy in class; let's call him Z. 

CS knows I've got a massive crush on him since day 1. Can you blame me, though? He's charming and kind, giving off golden retriever energy, my ideal guy. A few weeks ago, though, I noticed CS and Z being cozy with each other, which made my blood boil and I felt betrayed. I didn’t know they were close; the only time they had a conversation was when Z congratulated her for being one of the competitors in the upcoming international science and math quiz bee. I know I have no rights over Z, but I trusted her enough to tell her my feelings for him, and now I'm seeing this. 

And here's the part where people are calling me out for being a bad friend; in the cafeteria, I overheard a group of girls praising how perfect she was, and I, being pissed with her and Z, decided to butt in and tell a harmless joke, which spread like wildfire. In my defense, I didn't think those girls would fall for my joke, nor should it be a big deal. I only said CS's parents are bribing the school for her awards. Why should I take the blame for being convincing enough that even though those rumors about CS were false, everyone, including Z, instantly turned their backs on her and hated her? And I don't believe it's my fault they judged her that easily, so I don't understand why they blame me now, that even Z confronted me about it, and when I told him the truth, he said he was disappointed.

She has a feeding tube, and her life expectancy is very short, which is a massive shock as she is in her 50s. For context, SIL lives at home but her moving back was not related to the diagnosis. 

CONTEXT: The other siblings and their partners (me included) don't all work 9-5s so coordinating time to go home is difficult. The family home is between 1.5-3 hours from us depending on traffic, so dropping in isn't easy. When we do find time, we'll often only know a day or so in advance, so we need to keep things flexible.

For this reason, but also to be mindful of MIL, we have started insisting that food is not the focus. We don't want a 3 course dinner cooked for us. The last time we let SIL know that we could visit for a day or two (no timings confirmed), we told her not to cook anything fancy - a sandwich would do and if that didn't work with her, we'd eat on route. Lo and behold, a 3 course meal had been planned for lunch and, when we didn't make it in time for lunch, she was visibly upset and cold with us the rest of the weekend.  

Onto the main issue: It is very likely that this Christmas will be MIL's last, and so naturally we want this to be a memorable family occasion. If SIL had it her way, every single meal would be a 3+ course affair, so FIL has said that she can only prepare 2 meals that way over the festive season, which I think is reasonable. Each of these meals usually take a full day of prep and then around 3 hours at the table. However, as usual, SIL has immediately launched into food planning and prep. It is clear that she is not going to listen to FIL. 

My partner and I have been discussing whether to boycot mealtimes at the house. We want to do something that MIL can actually be involved in. SIL will not listen to our suggestions that food be simple and secondary, so we think we need to set a firm boundary that we are not visiting for the food. To faciliate this, we'll either eat while doing activities with the family, or cook quick and easy meals at the house using our own supplies.

However, I know that this decision will cause a rift. Tensions are already high in the family because of the diagnosis, and SIL's relationship with the rest of the family isn't great. She has told us that food is her love language, and it is clear from past experiences that not showing up to the meals will cause more tension. However, it just feels tone deaf to revolve the holiday around food when one member of the family cannot eat.

I get a call from my daughter last night saying ""you are a vindictive bitch how could you"".  I was shocked asking myself what did I do? She said Caleb told her that I told Pete I hated him and that's why he left and I asked who told you that lie?. She replied Caleb did and I saw red before I knew what happened I told her the truth and sad Caleb ""did the deed"" with some else and Pete saw it.

My family heard the news and started to shun Caleb and he blamed me because I wasn't supposed to tell. He said I'm a bad mother and hung up. Pete on the other hand came over and apologized for yelling in his house and putting a hole through the door and said he was willing to pay for it.

Also on mobile.

I’ll try and keep it short.

I (32F) have been with my bf (40M) for about 7 years now. In the beginning we discussed having kids and he was against it, and for a while I was actually cool with that idea. But then, I turn out to be pregnant. I hadn’t had any problems or symptoms, I even got my period (or so I thought) so I only found out after a sudden morning sickness. Turned out I was already 20 weeks pregnant at my first ultrasound.
Boyfriend wasn’t happy to say the least, but abortion wasn’t even an option anymore (can only been done before 12 weeks pregnancy) and after a lot of discussions, tears and fights we just had to accept it was going to happen. 

We bought a house together during my pregnancy and moved in a month after giving birth. Everything had been going well, our son was really healthy and so was I, but my bf changed the moment our son was born. He was kind and loving at most times, but I noticed a lot of doubts and fears and stress coming from him. He would also almost fully stop giving me any affection and that hasn’t really changed.
Now our son is almost 4 and ready to go to school, which would mean we’d no longer have to pay for daycare which means that I have more money left, although I have a really bad-paying job.

Now onto the problem…. I am pregnant again. We made a mistake and I found out a few weeks ago. I am now terrified for our future, because bf seems to think we will never be able to afford anything again given our second would also have to go to daycare, and that’s really expensive in my country.
All our problems would go away if I abort, but for obvious reasons I simply can not, and refuse to even consider it.

We will have issues logistically since I don’t have a drivers license and rely on either public transport or use my bicycle. Also no family or friends around who’d be able to babysit.

I am at a loss on what to do. I could quit my low-paying job, which would mean I wouldn’t have to pay for daycare, but then again I’d also have zero income. Everything is becoming more and more expensive and I am really worried my bf will be right and we won’t be able to pay for the needs of our second (or us as parents, since we’d just simply stop spending on ourselves). 
Mortgage is high, bills for electricity and water are ridiculous at the moment and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I would leave my boyfriend if he would suggest abortion again, but I really, truly, deeply love him, so I’d be devastated. Also wouldn’t want my kids to grow up without their father.

Now here’s my question. WIBTA if I force my boyfriend to become a father once more? I can’t force him to stay, as much as he can’t force me to abort. But I feel so lost, stressed out and fearful. Do we really don’t have a choice and is abortion the only resolution to our problems? I am so worried!

Hello dear community!
This has been bugging me for quite a while now so I thought I'd ask the reddit gods if I am the A-hole
Also sorry if this somewhat turns into an rant. I just need to let off all the steam...
Small disclaimer beforehand: some of this has had to do with written role-playing, others again happened...let's say more in real life
2nd disclaimer: I'll refer to my BFF here as ""Jane"" (sorry t Jane's out there!)
Sooo... my (f, 24) BFF (f, 25) and I had a...bigger fallout like two weeks ago where she accused me of never looking after her feelings.. which I actually did. I did look after her feelings and rarely said ""no"" to anything because I didn't want to make her upset + whenever I got upset I would go off, ofc letting her know that I'll be doing something else I.e. drawing or reading a book, just so I wouldn't lash out onto her 
Every time she cried I listened to her and tried to cheer her up.
But how did that fallout happen?
Well. I've got an minecraft server and an friend and me build a small village before we kidnapped villagers and due to it being surrounded by forests, meaning monsters could spawn, I was happy when finally one cat spawned to at least keep creepers away (Note: we did not have enough iron to make iron golems; most of the time all we found was copper or coal)
Jane then came online and ""LET ME GET FISH. I WANT THAT CAT"" to which I calmly replied ""I'd like to keep the cat with the villagers please..  y'know due to creepers"" and then she lashed out at me.
Mind you due to my past (not gonna talk about that here) I had quite an defense mechanism against that but then again didn't wanna hurt her feelings by.....screaming at her.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4815078,public,top,self,AITA for telling my BFF off?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1s4t4/aita_for_telling_my_bff_off/,all_ads,6,,,,,

He is keeping this a secret from everyone he works with for the sake of his job. I am friends with our mutual friend (lets call him Ryan, 26M) that he works with (and is very close with) that he introduced me to long before this ever started. Ryan and I formed a good friendship outside of my flatmate.

I have no relation to his work (besides Ryan), but I have been keeping his secret for him to be a good friend. Him and this girl have been slipping up in front of their coworkers for months. When I would hang out with Ryan, he would tell me he knows the secret I'm keeping for them, but is aware I can't in good conscience come clean. Ryan would update me on the fact that everyone at their workplace knew about the relationship. Ryan then tells me he's messaged our friend a joke about said relationship, and our friend did not deny it. I then assume our friend is aware that Ryan knows. The boss has asked my flatmate about the relationship before, which he denied.

On the weekend, Ryan tells me my flatmate is at a work thing and won't be home at our flat until 10:30pm. Ryan then asks if he's gone before our friend comes back, can he come over to hang out. Normally I demand that we hang out at his house. I let my guard down knowing that their relationship apparently isn't a secret anymore and say yes.

We lose track of time and as Ryan leaves, our mutual friend and this girl pull up to our flat. I apologise for not warning them prior, I have no problem taking accountability for that. I anticipated not needing to, which was my mistake. The girl, whom I have become close with, forgave me almost immediately.

My flatmates reaction however, is what I want opinions on. Since apologising to my flatmate about the encounter, he is now demanding that I report to him on exactly who comes in and out of my bedroom as ''common courtesy''. This includes any one night stands (which are very rare from me) and an exisiting fwb situations I have had for around 5 months now whom he calls a ''stranger''. His gf has called his reaction harsh, considering I have been more careful than them for 7 months attempting to keep their secret. His response to that was for me to not be friends with ''his mate'' Ryan, and that it was not an ''honest mistake''. Ryan is saying my flatmate is freaking out about the interaction and is taking it out on me. He has been passive aggressive since in our flat's groupchat.

I understand I am the asshole for not providing a prior warning, but this reaction seems unfair. Everyone in the situation except for him is capable of understanding this was a fuck up from me, but the consequences of that mistake are non-existant. Ryan has advocated for our flatmates wellbeing since he started in his role, and they are nothing less than good friends.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4815068,public,top,self,AITA For Letting My Guard Down?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1s03j/aita_for_letting_my_guard_down/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I (25f) have a side hustle baking. It's low key, but I'm a good baker and decorator, and my friends and family often place orders with me for events. 

I have a mutual friend, I'll call her Kylie (23f) who dmed me a few days ago. Her sister was turning 21 and she was organizing a big birthday for her. The person she ordered the cake from fell through last minute and she knows I bake custom cakes, so she reached out asking if she could place a order. 

Keep in mind that wanted delivery 2 days after she contacted me, so it was extremely last minute. I usually take orders 1-2 weeks in advance minimum. Kylie sent me a design of the cake. In a regular order, I'd charge around $60 for what she wanted. However because of the timing, I charged more.

Kylie said she didn't think it would cost this much, I told her why I was charging more, she replied she ""understood that"", but it sounds like a lot. Again, I explained the reasons, but she kept insisting I bring it down. She also tried to guilt trip me, saying it's for her sick sister and I should do it for less.

I replied I'm sorry about her sister, but this is my price. I don't do handouts and if she doesn't want to pay, she can find other bakers.

Kylie got pretty upset, and I saw that she ended up unfollowing and removing me from her followers. 

The thing is I don't even know Kylie super well. We have mutual friends and we (used to I guess) follow each others socials, but that's about it. If she was close family or friends, then sure I might've considered this a favor. I don't think I'm wrong but I talked to a few friends about this and they're split, with some saying she was acting entitled and some saying I should've done it for less.

It's been 8 years since my father left home for another woman. My mother assumed his responsibilities and that's why I admire her so much. She is a strong woman and even suffering a lot she doesn't feel resentment or hate towards him, but pity.

My relationship with my father is not the best, he never comes to see us, sometimes we only see him once every 3 to 2 years, and suddenly he disappears again. He rarely texts and never calls. He has two daughters, a 4-year-old and a 2-year-old, from the same woman with whom he cheated on my mother.

In 2018 he reappeared again, we had not heard from him for over 6 months. He texted my older sister saying he had been in a motorcycle accident and was hospitalized. What had happened was that he was making a delivery and he ended up losing control and hitting a car. He ended up piercing his lung and chest, almost going through his ribs. My father really could have died. He sent pictures of himself bandaged and lying in a hospital bed. When I found out I didn't care, because he never cared when my sister or I got sick, so why should it be any different with him?
When my mom found out she was worried, my dad was mad that we didn't care as much as he wanted us to. He said he was our father and we should pay attention to him. For my part, I didn't ask and I didn't make a point of knowing his whereabouts, I didn't care and I don't care.

So I’m a 26-year-old girl who works as a CNA, and I go to UCLA part-time, so I work part-time and go to UCLA part-time. I live in Los Angeles county. I don’t talk to my neighbors because the ones up front sit out front for hours and invite their family over, and they gossip about me right in front of me when Covid was happening to go, like, where is she going? What was she doing when I was going to get my nursing license?

I’m also irritated because the woman across the way constantly leaves stuff for days in our shared laundry machine but complains if you move it, and she also had a boyfriend that sexually harassed me for years. She would constantly invite them back to the apartment. They would sit at the bottom of the stairs and harass him about my not wanting to talk to him. One time he barged into my apartment, and I had to force him out.I never complained about the landlord about this stuff. Still, I completely ignored this woman's Neighbor because her boyfriend harassed me, and I don’t like the neighbors upfront because they’re friends with this neighbor lady. she acts like I’m a complete b\*tch because I’m angry. After all, she would invite a guy that would harass m.

Well, new neighbors move in, and my neighbors tell them that I’m psycho and crazy and not to talk to me. My neighbors are all 40, and I’m like 26 years old. My new neighbors are in their late 20s or something. I’ve never introduced myself or talked to them, but they constantly leave their blinds open at night or their blinds open, pointing toward the hallway. I have to pass by their apartment to get to my car or to go to leave the apartment, and their apartment is in my line of vision.

They constantly passive-aggressively close the blinds like I’m trying to peep into their apartment. I’m starting to get irritated by this cause they need to get privacy curtains or something. I honestly want nothing to do with them, and I don’t understand why they have their way open at night.

Let's call her 'L'. I had wanted to do this for a long time but for the benefit of my social group, I stayed civil. 

Some background; 'L' is, IMO, toxic. She's absolutely man obsessed but takes issue with anyone in a relationship. She gets overly involved in people's lives and relationships. She's constantly talking behind people's backs, she's lost several friends and it's always her who's the victim. 

I distanced myself from her when I saw her get really close to a guy I dated the SECOND we broke up. With my current boyfriend, she tried to get way too involved in our life. He felt it too and it made us both really uncomfortable. 

2 months ago she tried to start drama between me and my best friend and I'd finally had enough. I sent her a message along the lines of 'I need some time for me. I'm not trying to hurt you, I'm not even saying you're in the wrong, but I'm not comfortable with being talked about and need to take a step back from our friendship.' She denied everything but I held my ground and she eventually backed off. 

So to the AITA part. This weekend a friend is having a Thanksgiving party at my place as hers is too small. There's about 17 of us. 'L' would know the guests from other parties, but they wouldn't exactly be close friends (she'd never see them 1 on 1 for example). She messaged me yesterday, for the first time since the 'break up', to say she's meeting some of the girls this weekend and would love to see me. I know for a fact she's not meeting the girls because they're coming to thanksgiving and so I think she's fishing for an invite. I told her I wasn't free, but that a night out with everyone could be fun in the coming weeks. I'm torn. I don't want her to feel left out so I feel like an asshole, but I also don't think it's appropriate for her to come. Firstly, we're no longer friends. I don't invite people who are not my friends into my home. And secondly, it's my friends party taking place at mine. This friend and 'L' don't get along so she never would have been invited if it wasn't at my place anyways.

G and I only reconnected about a year ago because she moved away when we were in middle school. My boyfriend P and I have been together for 5 years and I have been suffering from serve mental health problems and my journey to recovery is only recently started.

So a week ago G, F, P and I went to watch a movie together. Before it started G needed to go to the bathroom so I went and joined too because it was a long movie. Before walking back in G pulled me aside and said can I tell you something, making me swear not to tell P, me unaware of how serious it was without giving it a second choice and because I want my friend to trust me I said yes. She proceeds to tell me that she is pregnant and her family and another friend T knows. I was of course taken back asked if she was okay and what her plans were to proceed. We went back into the movies and I was too shocked to take in a lot of the movie tbh. 

During my therapy I have been told not to keep in my emotions and to speak to P and mom whenever I felt overwhelmed and stressed. I understood that the pregnancy has nothing to do with Me my stress laid with how there mental health was going to be and how I can try to support them the best I can. When I spoke to P and Mom I didn’t think much of it more just to let out my anxieties and not to put any extra stress onto G.  

A couple of nights later I was drunk and P was driving us home with T when I turned to him and said I assume you know about the situation and the abortion happening, I have offered to drive them both just incase F isn’t allowed in with G and if G is inconsolable after the procedure they don’t have to worry about driving home cause we will have it sorted. 

At this time I wasn’t aware that F didn’t know that I knew as I thought it would have been communicated. All of this leads to today were I was told I have been disrespectful to their story and by telling other people it has gotten to out of hand and they felt by me not mentioning that I talked to T that I was going behind there back and telling everyone(which again I literally only told mom and P). As well as I was trying to be a hero which isn’t what they needed.

I swear to god that was never EVER my intention, I just needed to let out my emotions to my boyfriend who was never and still hasn’t said a word to anyone nor my mom. I just wanted to make sure they felt supported by the people around them and knew that we would help in anyway that they need.

I’m the only college graduate in my family. My two younger siblings work retail jobs and the youngest still lives with our parents in their apartment. The older of the two lives with roommates. My family live in a different state while we live near his family.

The favorite topics of discussion for Bill’s family are finances, investments, the current state of the property portfolio, and politics and it affects the markets. They’re not bragging about it or trying to rub it in anyone’s face. They discuss these topics to educate or help each other out. Once one of his sibling was going to buy another rental house and another sibling cautioned that the interest was going to go up so they should wait for the asking price of the house to drop. Another time his siblings debated for hours whether or not to buy bonds being offered by our city. At one lake outing, two of his siblings were discussing their rental properties and by the end of the night, they traded 3 rental houses for a gas station and some cash. Who does that?!?

We normally rotate holidays between our families but this year I invited my family to spend thanksgiving with us because Bill and I bought a house a few months ago. They are driving and will be staying with us. Our parents have met before and when they found out my family will be in town, they insisted on hosting my family for dinners and lunches. Bill’s family is wonderful but I’m having an anxiety attack over this.

I know my family will feel like failures and get their feelings hurt if Bill’s siblings start to talk about their stock portfolio or the latest strip mall they’re building. My parents know how much better off Bill’s family are and they’re already self conscious.

I'm a mother of a 16 (soon 17) daughter ""Kelly"". Her bio dad left when she was 4. It's complicated but despite him being away he still sent money or had his family help from time to time. I still struggled a lot raising her til I met my now husband ""Christopher"". Christopher is like a dad to Kelly. He's the only father figure she had.


However, I found out that she's reconnected with her bio dad through his family (his mother) which I wasn't happy about but I didn't make a fuss about it. Then she started mentioning him often, going to visit him while canceling plans to hang out with us etc. Her justification is that her dad is sick and might be (I say might because she's a child and may not know what it meant) terminal. She sees him at his friend's house where he's staying now.


Christopher and I were planning her 17th birthday party at our house. Kelly told me that she'd like to have her bio dad come over to celebrate since he may not be able to be around next year. Christopher said no immediately. He said he won't let that man come into his house which made Kelly cry saying that we were robbing her of a last chance to make memories with her dad after finally finding him again. I told her that I don't feel comfortable having him come to the house and be in the same room as him. Her stepsister said that both me and christopher are overreacting and that Kelly wants her dad to take part in her birthday so badly. Christopher left the house and I snapped at Kelly and threatened to cancel the whole thing.


Later whrn we calmed down I suggested she goes to celebrate with him but she said her friends and their parents won't be able to attend. She also said he can't throw her the party since he's sick. We had another argument and she started ignoring me and christopher while staying in her room. She's saying she won't forgive me if I let her dad miss what coukd be her last birthday with him.

Yesterday I heard that the whole of the Boxing Day plans have been totally changed! My aunt who got married in February had decided this year we will do the celebration at her house ( we usually do this at our grandparents house) she will be inviting her in-laws (this has not been discussed with anyone else). This is now going to make the gift giving really awkward as her in-laws were not included in our secret Santa. 

And to top it all off now we have to do our gift giving another day ( which will lead to multiple people in the family not being present - they have to work over Christmas and only have off the UK bank holidays, Christmas and Boxing Day)

My mother(61F), having been on welfare for the majority of her life, has decided to take her art and create an online business out of it. Very proud of her, but anyways. She needs to report her income to the powers that be. She has asked me (33M) to file her taxes for her, and to complete all the paperwork for our Government (since she is still on Disability, has subsidized housing etc). I am in no way an expert at any of this, but I am a capable human being and it is within my abilities to do this work.

Now for the details so ya'll can judge away. My mother is disabled, with terminal COPD (Smoking). She also has PTSD. Does not leave the house often, with the exception of me accompanying her. I help her mail her things for her business, do her groceries, other errands etc. I myself work full time as an addictions counsellor (In recovery myself) at the hospital and casually as a Chef for a catering company. I do this for her because I appreciate well, her being my mother, and I feel bad that her physical health is declining so much. That and she never outright rejected me when I was a horrid alcoholic/drug addict. It's not too bad, only takes up maybe 6-8 hours of my week each week, and it gives me an excuse to visit her.

I did tell her this time I would do it for free, so I am going to honour that agreement, but AITA for wanting to tell her that next time (needs to be done quarterly) I want $50/hr for doing this work?

So I don't buy the whole ""Help me, I'm helpless and cannot understand paperwork"" bullshit. I don't mind helping her with physical stuff because she is disabled, but I work full time as well and this paperwork is maddening.

Not only is she not rideable because of her size, she has cancer. Honestly I'm not sure how much longer she has and my place is more of a hospice. She's also lost weight because of it so now she's getting pampered while she lives out her life. She wants peppermints and apples after her meals? She can have a few bites.

Occasionally I have a few neighbors with kids who come say hi to the horses. Usually not a problem since they typically keep an eye on the kids and I know them. Just can't go into the pastures. Few weeks ago we had a new family with young kids move in. I believe they're around 10 but unsure of exact age.

They came over and said hi, and they asked if they can also say hi to the horses so I said yes and explained it has to be over the fence, kids need to be supervised at all times, and they can't ride. For a while they were respectable of this or so I thought.

Maybe a week ago I received a text from other neighbor that those new kids have been over without parents. I have cameras around the property but seldom check them, but sure enough, they were seen messing with the horses and trying to ride, especially the sick mare I mentioned earlier.

I went over to their house and told them the kids were banned from the property unless they were supervised and I was also there then explained one of them is sick. Next day the kids (only the kids, no parents) rang the bell and asked if they could ride the horses. I said no and sent the kids back. I texted the parents ""we discussed this yesterday, you need to watch your kids. I specifically explained no riding horses either. If this keeps happening, I'll be getting the law enforcement involved.""

I haven't seen the kids for a few days so I thought I got my point across. I was grocery shopping and I got an alert on my phone from my cameras. I changed the settings just to be on the safe side after I sent the text to the new neighbors. It was the kids again, and they were definitely messing with the sick mare and trying to ride. I guess she doesn't look as intimidating because of her size.

I called the cops and told them someone's trespassing on my property. I got there as soon as I could and an officer and the parents were already there. I explained to the officer that the neighbors were told of the rules and showed him the text and the security footage. Parents' faces were turning redder by the second and tried to claim i was lying. Since I had footage, officer issued a warning to the parents and told them if it happens again, I could press trespassing charges.

The kids were crying and their dad started throwing their own tantrums, saying it wasn't fair and the kids had every right to ride. I looked at him in the eye and deadpan said ""oh ok does that mean I can force your elderly dad to give me a piggyback ride when he's bed ridden with cancer?""

Officer were trying so hard not to laugh as he told the family that they need to get off the property.

We've had arguments, but nothing serious. She constantly tried to avoid the arguments and never said anything because she assumed that I would react aggressively about it, because she was in this emotional state herself (it was always about text, because she didn't want to talk or meet, because she had ""no time"" or I simply couldn't (because of work, etc)) and instead she wrote about the arguments and the problems with other guys. Last week she just stayed at my home and logged into my second PC (also via discord) so that we could just play our mc world just together. And when I tried to log her out 3 days ago, she got a new message at that moment. Out of curiosity, I just clicked on it for a moment (which is disgraceful, because I give her privacy and I want her to do what ever she wants) and then I see that she talked about me. Of course I kept on reading. And she also wrote so much bullshit with the two guys. Especially something like: ""Actually I don't love him"" and ""I'm there for sex"", etc. The guys of course told her that she should leave me and one of them offered her help (because he is into her). That hit me hard at first. Then I ignored her for the next two days, just to ensure that I get my life back on track and mentally prepare to be single again. So I called her yesterday to clarify. She replied with two main things in our almost two hour call:
First, that she just ""vented"" to them, because she thought I would react aggressive. I didnt understand that, because I never screamed at her nor have I beaten her. 
Second, she admitted that she felt the vibe digitally more with another guy, instead of me. She likes to do more stuff with him, but still wants me for the ""fun""? She said, that she does love me bla bla bla and continued to say that in reallife it's different. 

What I also found out via a friend, that she was flirting with multiple boys. And this just doesnt sits right with me.

For context, my Dad died in September, he was really I'll, no doctors could help him anymore. He was sick for years, Mom and me caring for him and working shifts. (Grandmother lives with us as well, she has dementia).
Dad had a brother, they were never on good terms. They had a better relationship after they both fell sick(Uncle had leukemia with complications I won't write because it's too much). His brother in unmarried, and over 50. He lives in another town not far from us. 
A few weeks before my father died, Uncle had one of his legs amputated and he needed major surgery on the other one. Both were done in a major city, not where we live. Mom and me were running daily to the hospital to him and brought what he needed, while going to doctor's visits with Dad too. They were both in the same hospital when Dad died. My Uncle is sick, he has another cousin and we asked him to care for him, bring him to dr.'s appointments, help him bathe, etc. He did not. One of his friends-M. brought him to his appointments, but not for free. My Uncle ha minimal income that is barely enough for his medication. 
So, this friend was always calling Mom and telling her what was happening, that we should be more implied, care for him more etc. I observed Mom was not well and I asked her about. She told me her problem was the constant nagging and phone calls, she doesn't have in her to care for another sick person, she'd had enough with Dad (almost 8 years of physical and neurological illnesses, and more than 10 years with Granny who has dementia) 
So I called this friend and asked him to stop with the constant calls, just give us the major news. I never said we would not care at all for my Uncle, but we cannot go at every beck and call M would like to. Uncle never called us, only his friend, who talked to me like I was cursing his mother, and told me he would not care for him. I told my mother about and she just shrugged. 
I feel sorry for my Uncle, but I literally gave up my life for my father and grandma,(I'm 34, single) I'd like some peace. And Mom had depression, I'd really avoid it but I can see the signs of it on her.

I’m now enrolled in an online class where they have teachers from all over the globe and I literally just skipped a video because the dude was so inarticulate I had to first switch the subs on (I could understand him without but it was beyond annoying) and then just gave up because what he was saying just wasn’t valuable enough to justify all the effort.
And while a lot of the time I really hate people whose accents come from simply being non-native speakers, I also find myself hating small and very specific groups of native speaker accents.
This feels kinda racist or at least entitled but I just can’t help it.
And when I call a helpline or an office front desk and the person on the other end is just barely coherent in their enunciation, I just want to hang up and not do business with them.
It’s funny how non-native speakers usually get really embarrassed when I ask them (politely! and in the most rare situations) to “say that again”, but native speakers react to the same thing with an air of superiority because they think I just don’t know the language well enough to understand them (I’m not a native speaker), but the reality is, I wouldn’t understand people who speaking in my native tongue if they where mumbling like that with a thick super regional accent and vocabulary either.
I just hate it. I keep thinking why can’t people work on their super thick accents. But it’s me who’s bothered, so I’m kind of guessing I’m the asshole here? Is this also racist?

In 2020 i got a better offer from other company and i left. One of the reasons i left was everytime i got a promotion or got any project people always think i got a special treatment because of my relationship with him, while i know i work my ass off for years, and the environment is toxic.

We’re together for 2 years.
We live in the same neighborhood, his mom also lives around here, i ran into his mom time to time and we’re still friendly with each other.
His mom is a dentist and there were times i got a root canal and his mom treated me for free, eventhough i told him i got insurance could go to any other dentist, but i was in so much pain and he insisted that time.
I also lost my sister when we dated, and he was my rock during those times. 

We also spent Christmas together with his family. We broke up because in my gut, i could never trust him, he’s charming, and there are many women who actually pursue him all the time, a big executive, nice bod, etc. He’s like Don Draper in Mad Men. But i also know he’s a type of guy who say what i want to hear instead of what he really feels. 
I broke up with him when he propose and i know i dont want to have a forever with him.
After we broke up, i had my regrets, but then he got back with his ex, while also seeing another yet younger employee, and i met him once in a bar with another younger female.
Which made me realize, i dodge a bullet.

Few weeks a go his mom passed, he’s the one who found her in her home alone, it was tragic. 
My friends from my old company all went there, but i was actually cramped with work before the funeral, and during the funeral day, i was a bridesmaid a friend’s wedding. 
The bride who’s also work in the same company with him, so many people went to the funeral after the wedding.
People who went to the funeral also took picture of his gf who sit in front of his other girl, and there’s this other girl who had a fling with him, they make it as a joke, like all his groupies are there. so i dont feel like i want to go. 

I text him the next day, tell him how sorry i am and all my condolences. Then he called me, and he told me that he’s furious, and that his mom would’ve want me there, that i was her mom’s favorite, how could i didn’t pay my respect to her, and he said that he never really get over me but now he did because i was just using him for the promotion, used his mom for a free dental care, using his family for a Christmas trip, and he bring up all the anniversary and birthday gifts, and he bring up he was there when my sister passed.

So, it was about a week after we broke up, and I asked her if she would want to go with me. She seemed cool about it and said if we couldn’t  find anyone else to go with then we could go together.She insisted it wasn’t weird. Well two weeks go by and I hadn’t heard anything else from her  so I decided to text and ask if we were still going together because the tickets were going on sale soon.

I had to leave a week earlier &amp; stay in a hotel because Martina's roommate &amp; other best friend ""Carla"" suddenly decided she had a problem with me. Apparently something was said by me, but I don't know what it was. Carla can ve very unkind in general and she made me regret going to visit Martina. I was told to leave suddenly. I had some items with me from my deceased parent who I lost last year. Being vague on details for privacy but the items in question are very much of the ""priceless to me, worthless to anyone else"" nature Martina told me to leave them so I don't leave them at the hotel, and she will put them in my main luggage and bring it to the airport. The items were not in my luggage. 

Martina was about 6 weeks pregnant when I left - pregnancy was planned by her but not her boyfriend of about 18mo if you can pick up what I'm putting down. Once I was gone, Martina basically ghosted me &amp; that I'm not a priority now she is pregnant. 

I asked Martina to return them items. She has not done so and it has been almost a year now and I'm sick of begging. A couple of former mutual friends told me I was irresponsible for leaving them but I made a split second decision because Martina said they'd be safe with her. What is bothering me the most is that I've been told I need to get over it because ""Martina has a baby now"". Am I an asshole for thinking that being a parent isn't an excuse to not return these items? I know parenthood can be hectic but I asked her before she had the baby, gave her money to post them. I feel very much like my grief is being invalidated because I don't have a child and it is upsetting me, and I want to know if I am unreasonable. I also loaned Martina about $3500 that I said I will forget about since I stayed with her, I just want my stuff back.
