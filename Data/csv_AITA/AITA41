I work 40 hours a week sometimes  more  it depends on who bothers  to show up  for their shift. I understand  that  people  have  emergencies  or get sick but let me set the scene for the last two days.  
On Friday  our town  had its  Christmas  Parade.  My boss, coworker and  I were working  the closing shift which was nice  cause the parking lot of where we work is the staging area for the parade, so the last hour or so of work would actually  be  on the slow side. I was informed by our boss that we'd  be  closing an hour early.  Which was fine as  I'd already covered two  additional  shifts  putting  me into overtime  (which the big bosses don't like at any time  or for any  reason ). While we were closing our boss told us that we'd be  closing  very early on Saturday  (yesterday). Again I didn't  mind even though it  would eat into my overtime. 
Co worker  asked if she could come in early as she was supposed to  close and wouldn't get her full hours for the  day. Boss told her yes .

On Saturday  I walk into work only to find coworker has called in, supposedly  sick. 
Our district manager is  screaming  over the  phone  about not being  informed  and demanding that we don't close early . Our manager  had the day off. 
The person in charge is  the  key holder and the main reason for  closing early, she didn't have a  babysitter for her son. I used to have her position but due to politics..........

I didn't  pack/bring a  lunch  as due to the plan we wouldn't be taking lunches. I never got a true break. Well after many calls we wound up  staying  open  almost the full day.  
This is not the first time that  this scenario has  happened.  

The district manager came in after the manager came in ranting and raving .20 minutes  before we had decided to  shut down an hour early  since the back room  coworker  and I never got lunch(he's not  trained to  run cash registers). She as I was informed  did know about the situation.  

She yelled at me that I could have  closed. Just for note I no longer have  store keys or the proper codes to shut down the  registers. 

I told her that even using  her codes that I had no staff no relief  cashier to cover lunches or standard  law given 15 min breaks. I even pointed out that the person she gave my position to  couldn't even do bank runs as she has no car .

Our district manager  got slightly  mad and stormed off to the back room.

since finishing up the piece, she has asked me for about 12 different revisions. she has asked me for different shaped stars, different sized stars, more stars, less stars, a complete redesign of the character, multiple different color changes, environment changes, and more. overall i think i’ve redone the piece a few times, and she still isn’t satisfied. as well as this, she has been constantly (purposefully) misgendering me, and ended up berating me once i said i might have to charge more if she wanted more changes since this piece has completely taken up my finals week. 

once i sent her the final piece, she sent me a novel of texts saying “what’s so hard to understand? just make the character red!!!” after telling me she wanted the character to stand out with “cool” colors. once i changed the lineart to red, she claimed it looked sloppy and she wanted me to take more time on it. i told her that normally i allow three revisions per piece (which is not something i told her in the beginning, which i should have) and after that i will start charging for my time. i gave her more than double the amount of revisions without charging, but at this point it’s getting a little ridiculous. she has not paid me the rest of the money for the commission (she only paid $40 upfront, even though i take full payment before finishing the commission normally). i feel she is not respecting me as an artist, my identity, and my time. i would have been more than happy if she gave me exactly what she wanted, gave me a few revisions to make, and stopped constantly going back and forth. sorry this was so long, i’m having a hard time properly finding the words!",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4853485,public,top,self,AITA for trying to charge a commission client for more money?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcdo5a/aita_for_trying_to_charge_a_commission_client_for/,all_ads,6,,

I was very stressed out and exhausted because I stayed up all of Thursday and Friday to work more on my speeches, so I planned to get home and go to bed right away

My parents are currently in Mexico for their anniversary, and because I am too young to stay on my own for a week, and I need a ride to my tournaments, my grandparents volunteered to stay with me. On Thanksgiving, we talked about their stay, and I promised that I would cook all of the meals(except  Friday) and they wouldn't have to worry about anything. They accept my promise but ask if I'm sure I won't be too tired on Saturday. I promise again that I would cook on Saturday. 

My parents left on Wednesday of this week, and my grandparents showed up during school that day. Everything was going great, I cooked for them and we played games. Friday went pretty terrible though and I needed to write all new speeches for the next day, so I stayed up till 3-ish. Saturday went a lot better, I didn't place but everything worked out. My team got to go home early because no one moved on to the elimination rounds, At about 3:00.

When I got home I went to take a nap, and I set an alarm for 6 so I could make myself a small dinner. I went downstairs and my grandparents were playing a card game, so I made myself a sandwich and told them that I would be going to sleep after I finished. They seemed fine with that, so I ate. I get yelled at whenever I leave my dishes in my room so I brought my plate down and they were still playing cards. 

I said good night to them, and my grandma turns around with a look of disbelief on her face(she overreacts to everything). ""What? You're going to bed now? But I'm hungry!""

""I'm sorry grandma, I don't want to spend 40 minutes making the meal we planned, maybe tomorrow night."" 

""No, but you promised! It's fine, I'll help and then you can be lazy. Besides, it's only 6:30 you can't go to bed this early"" At this point I was inching my way closer to the stairs, not wanting to deal with this. 

""I'm sorry, I already ate, I thought we kind of mentally agreed that we were fending after I made myself a sandwich. We have leftovers from other nights, or I could make a quick something if you want"" 

She rolled her eyes at me. ""I wanted that kielbasa. But fine, we'll eat your cold leftovers if you insist on being lazy. Good night"" 

I kinda snapped. I was just tired and irritable.""Fine! Eat your cold food, it's not like we have a microwave right there! I've been working all week, cleaning for you guys, cooking for you guys.

This is both of our first relationship, so I know that we aren’t perfect, but we both really do like what we have together. I know arguments are inevitable, but this incident was too much for me. Some background; Ive been prone to panic attacks ever since I was younger due to some childhood trauma. I don’t want to go into too much detail, but at the time I started dating bf, I was having panic attacks most nights due to night terrors. These panic attacks just consist of me shaking and crying uncontrollably, curling into a ball and having a hard time talking because i start to breathe heavy. I was honest with him about it when i first stayed the night with him. He told me it was okay and made me feel safe. Everytime that I had a panic attack around him, he was there for me. This eventually started helping a lot. I felt safe with him and over time I started experiencing them less. Ive always been grateful for him. However, as they started occurring less, he began getting more annoyed with me still experiencing them. This escalated to him yelling “just talk” and “idk how to help you” at me during a panic attack caused by having to euthanize my bird.Later, I communicated with that if i had a panic attack and he wasnt up to helping me through it, its okay for him to step away and allow me to relax on my own. I made it clear he did not have to help me, but he insisted he would so I explained that the way he treated me previously scared me and shared ways he could help calm me down. He apologized and promised that he understood and would never do it again. This leads to last night. We had a minor argument that we talked out, but something unrelated happened due to what was brought up and complete anxiety hit me and evolved into a panic attack. He just ignored me on his phone at first until he got annoyed and yelled at me to just talk followed by him grabbing my hands, shoving my phone in them and yelling at me to just type it out if i cant talk. he just got progressively more angry which was just making me feel worse. Once i calmed down a while later, i was pretty shaken up over how he treated me. So, i sat him down again to talk about it. He just started saying things like, “i didn’t do anything wrong,” and “youre fine now,” thats when i had enough and just said, “look i’ve forgiven you a lot for this and you keep promising you wont do it again. Please, i don’t want to be treated like this again. I know I’m usually pretty doubtful of myself, but i know i deserve to be treated better than this, so please treat me how i deserve or i cant keep justifying forgiving you for treating me that way.” After that, he treated me like i was gross for saying that i deserve better.

The downstairs toilet in our rental has been running water now for maybe 6 months on and off. We had  replaced a broken handle but the arm that reaches into the toilet attaches to the chain of the  flapper had to be bent out of the way of Flushing meter (that round thing in the corner of your toilet tank) because it kept getting caught on the flushing Metter components and running the water.

Our roommate left it running accidently this morning after a flush and my boyfriend mentioned that we need to make sure it's turned off by having the bar not get caught. I said I would like to let our landlord know so that a plumber could come by and maybe fix this issue. Boyfriend was against getting a plumber because he said the bar was the problem and that it torques around the flush meter, and he didn't want to pay a plumber $50 to ""fix"" it. 

I decided to call my dad because it was easier for me to get a quick answer. My dad spent 30 years as a  master electrician, 15 with his own home building business and is a jack of most trades. I've witnessed him take apart neighbors' sinks and put them back together, take apart a laundry machine, fix our toilet when i was a kid and other people's toilets, he knows what hes doing. 

During that call, he walked me through the part names and told me a solution could be to loosen a nut thing that would allow the flush meter to rotate slightly out of the way of the handle's bar. Meanwhile, my bf is in this tiny bathroom with me while Im on the phone and is loudly saying, ""THIS IS THE PROBLEM *NOT THIS* THIS IS THE PROPLEM."" while pointing and yanking at things in the tank. My dad had to ask us to be quieter since he couldn't hear. 

After getting off the phone, BF is freaking out about me ""calling daddy"" and emasculated him to my father and refusing to listen to what my dad say *might* be the problem. My bf said he knows what the problem is, it's the torqued handle, and then he ripped the toilet handle out of the toilet, tossed it on the counter and told me, ""There, fix it now."" 

AITA for calling my dad? No matter what is happening in my life I'll always call my dad for his knowledge on stuff like this.  We don't talk often on the phone and I enjoy learning these things from him.

I sat her down one day, and after a lot of coaxing, she told me that a few months ago, a random thought about her father popped in her head. She tried to ignore it, but it disturbed her so much, and she was struggling with disgust/confusion/fear.

I assured her it said nothing about her as a person. Unfortunately, she became very disturbed by the initial intrusive thought that it caused more for her, getting so bad that she started having anxiety. (Sometimes she would wake up in the morning with her heart pounding. In general, she was in a constant state of fear of having another thought.) 

For months, when I got back from work and she got back from school, we would lay in bed and talk for hours to diffuse her anxiety and comfort her. It helped, but the rest of my family saw how different she was acting, and I would just tell my concerned husband that there was no problem. I said she had a lot of questions about religion (back then, we were both more religious and my daughter and I often prayed together to help her), which was partially true, but I didn't think I could tell him the whole story then.

Later, after my husband repeatedly asked if there was more going on with her, I told him the full story about her intrusive thoughts. I never told my daughter I told him, but I also didn't want to leave my husband in the dark. 

A year later, after a lot of talking and soul-searching, my daughter has been doing better. But recently, she asked me if I ever told her dad about why she was acting odd during that time, and I admitted I did. She became very upset with me and said she suspected I did because her father has been acting ""different"" around her, even though I've never noticed a change. 

My intentions were never to hurt or embarrass her.

They do not know about my ED, and are constantly fawning over my body. This includes rubbing my arms, feeling my back muscles, rubbing my abs, and making numerous comments on my physical appearance.

While obviously this can be fun and flattering, I've also been struggling harder lately with my mental around food and my body. It felt bad to have something I struggle with to be positively reinforced so aggressively.

At some point in the evening it started to really make me uncomfortable. One of my Aunts, who I see less frequently and has recently become single, was sitting next to me and constantly rubbing my leg and arm. 

Someone else began analyzing my face and jawline, and I just blurted out ""can we please stop talking so much about how I look?""

The table got very quiet and awkward, and I was chastised for ""this is just how Aunties are"" and ""you work so hard for it, you should own it"" and ""dont be so shy."" The discussion stopped, but it made me feel like I had maybe overreacted.

Married 2 years, together 5. Husband is social. I'm social to an extent. I didn't know it when I was younger, but looking back, I suppose I had social anxiety as a kid and into my 20s. I've changed significantly and now do fairly well in social situations- I've learned that making conversation is actually a skill that you can practice and learn (who would've thought). I've come to a point where I even like parties and making conversation- it's like I'm on the flip side of the coin, but I still hit limits- I know when I'm ready to leave a party. Husband has always been aware and mostly supportive but it's hard for him to understand because he has no problems being social. 

My husband and I are at a place in our lives where we don't go out much. Most of our friends (or I should say his friends) have just had babies. His friends had a small party on Friday night, and we hadn't seen them in months. I had moments of discomfort but held my own and started conversations / kept conversations going / people approached me etc. Again, I've learned that this is a skill. I've come a REALLY long way. After about 3 hours (12:30am), someone said, ""She (me) must think we're crazy,"" because they were really drunk and singing and I was on the sidelines hanging out (I was ok but at the blurred line of my limit). That was my cue to go- my discomfort was apparently noticeable, and people had already started leaving the party.

I asked my husband if we could leave, and I knew he didn't want to- these were his friends that he hadn't seen in months. For that reason, I felt crappy about it and I do wish I was different, but I also knew I was at my limit, we had stayed about 3.5 hours by then, and I didn't want to embarrass myself with being awkward or noticeably uncomfortable. Someone struck up a good conversation with me, I was comfortable again and we ended up staying another 20-30 minutes or so. But after that, I pushed to go and my husband seemed disappointed but ok with leaving at that point.

When we got home, I asked him if it frustrates him that I'm ready to leave parties early on. He said sometimes, and that we can just drive separate to some parties going forward (which is annoying because I had suggested that early on when we were dating and he adamantly opposed it).

I told her I do not have enough as she looked disgusted. Another girl from her group said while the store was dead silent now. “She’s literally asking you on a date, like buy her something” Since when did asking someone for coffee turn into asking me on a date.

I've been super conflicted these last few weeks. My roommate (28F) came to me (26F) the other day and told me that she was sleeping with her boss (40M) who is married.

Just some background on my roommate and I: We met through a mutual friend and decided to room together in San Francisco starting this past June. She's a teacher (her boss is the principal of the school) and I work in investment banking. We're not super close and she's never had a lot of girlfriends, so our dynamic is a little odd, but it seems to be working. Given that we're not super close, she's not someone I can really call out on her behavior or she'll blowup, because she never thinks she is wrong. For example, she has a dog and I asked if she would vacuum the carpet to remove his dog hair because I usually clean our entire apartment and she extrapolated, started sobbing and told me that I make her feel like she's not good enough when I clean the apartment while she's not there.  So, all in all, not someone you really reason without it turning into a direct attack on her character.

Alright let's get back into the story after knowing all of that context. Her boss claims that he is separated from his wife (no papers have been drafted, they still live together etc.) but he goes home to his wife every night, deletes the messages between him and my roommate; the wife is always asking where he is, they go to events publicly, and him and my roommate have to keep it a secret because their coworkers know his wife and obviously because my roommate recently started working there so he's her superior. This is clearly an incredibly messy situation and I honestly wish my roommate would have never told me because the guilt is eating me alive (I am also the only person she has told so I hear all of the details), and I feel like a terrible person. I know that they've always been oddly close (she hangs out with him outside of work, got her a second job at the coffee shop he works at, and she's always telling me how they hang out in his office).

Another thing that really bothers me is that my roommate feels absolutely NO REMORSE like she talks about the wife like she's in a competition with her and talks about how his wife is the worst and laughs about the fact that he's married and ""chooses her"". She also seems to really like this guy and mentioned a future with him (but he can't tell the wife now because he doesn't want to have to pay more in the divorce settlement when the time comes-they signed a prenup). He will waltz into my apartment as if everything is normal almost every day and they'll do their thing and she'll tell me expressing zero remorse. I know this doesn't have anything to do with me but the guilt of knowing makes me feel so grimy and I really wish I could tell the wife but literally have no idea who she is and no medium to contact her. Am I the asshole for not telling his wife or should I be making more of an effort to let this woman know?

I (21f) have been renting a room from my roommate (I think 30f) since September. She’s mostly okay, she is picky about cleaning but I really love her cat Otto. Lately I’ve noticed she doesn’t really take good care of him and it’s started bothering me bc he’s a really great cat and he deserves better

SOME of the things that bother me

- she switches his food around CONSTANTLY. She always buys 5 or 6 brands, all different types and “rotates” them.

Hi everyone! I've been super conflicted these last few weeks. My roommate (28F) came to me (26F) the other day and told me that she was sleeping with her boss (40M) who is married.

Just some background on my roommate and I: We met through a mutual friend and decided to room together in San Francisco starting this past June. She's a teacher (her boss is the principal of the school) and I work in investment banking. We're not super close and she's never had a lot of girlfriends, so our dynamic is a little odd, but it seems to be working. Given that we're not super close, she's not someone I can really call out on her behavior or she'll blowup, because she never thinks she is wrong. For example, she has a dog and I asked if she would vacuum the carpet to remove his dog hair because I usually clean our entire apartment and she extrapolated, started sobbing and told me that I make her feel like she's not good enough when I clean the apartment while she's not there (that was my first and last time asking her to do a chore). So, all in all, not someone you really reason without it turning into a direct attack on her character.

Alright let's get back into the story after knowing all of that context. Her boss claims that he is separated from his wife (no papers have been drafted, they still live together etc.) but he goes home to his wife every night, deletes the messages between him and my roommate; the wife is always asking where he is, they go to events publicly, and him and my roommate have to keep it a secret because their coworkers know his wife and obviously because my roommate recently started working there so he's her superior. This is clearly an incredibly messy situation and I honestly wish my roommate would have never told me because the guilt is eating me alive (I am also the only person she has told so I hear all of the details), and I feel like a terrible person. I know that they've always been oddly close (she hangs out with him outside of work, got her a second job at the coffee shop he works at, and she's always telling me how they hang out in his office), Another thing that really bothers me is that my roommate feels absolutely NO REMORSE like she talks about the wife like she's in a competition with her and talks about how his wife is the worst and laughs about the fact that he's married and ""chooses her"". She also seems to really like this guy and mentioned a future with him (but he can't tell the wife now because he doesn't want to have to pay more in the divorce settlement when the time comes-they signed a prenup). He will waltz into my apartment as if everything is normal almost every day and they'll do their thing and she'll tell me expressing zero remorse. I know this doesn't have anything to do with me but the guilt of knowing makes me feel so grimy and I really wish I could tell the wife but literally have no idea who she is and no medium to contact her. Am I the asshole for not telling his wife or should I be making more of an effort to let this woman know?

So basically me and my fiancé are getting married next April. It’s going to be just 50 people, close friends and family only. We’re super busy with wedding preps (you know music, flowers and such) and are really looking forward to it.

We’ve printed out our invites some weeks ago and my maid of honor (best friend since childhood) and another friend of mine got theirs first as I met up with them in person. My parents and sister got theirs too, as well as my fiancés best friend. So 5 people got their invite at that point.

Basically me and fiancé forgot about the invites after that. We had no stamps at home and forgot them every time we met up with friends. I didn’t really worry about it, as we had sent out save the date cards  a while ago and basically everyone told us they were happy to come. 

A few days ago I got a nasty text from my maid of honor, accusing me of excluding friends from our wedding, as her boyfriend ( one of my fiancés closest friends) hadn’t been invited. I quickly explained the situation and told her it was just a misunderstanding, that we had bought stamps and sent out the invites just yesterday, but she didn’t believe me. 

Basically I found out that she went behind my back to ask around to see if someone had already gotten their invite. The friend that she asked mistook his save the date card for the official invite and told her that he had gotten it. So she went around and told the whole group of friends that we were excluding people from our wedding. Super uncomfortable situation for us, that was going on for weeks at that point. 

She sent me some more hurtful texts, I tried to explain to her what happened but she won’t listen or meet me in person. I honestly don’t know if I want her to come to my wedding at this point.

It was a beautiful wedding, absolutely no issues on the day and my guests still rave about how fun my wedding was as it was very laid back, fun and non-traditional.

The food at the wedding was a multi-course fine dining dinner with two desserts, as well as an open bar with signature cocktails and we ended the night with a sneaky after party pizza party (I organised for a local pizza parlour to bring in about 25 pizzas)

I heard NO complaints regarding the food until just last week.

My brother (35M) and his soon to be wife (30F) are planning their own wedding and his wife asked me about the catering of my own wedding, they then contacted the caterer (who is also a friend of mine) and this is when they found out that all the food at my wedding was vegan.

My brother quickly told everyone else in the family and now they are calling my an asshole for lying to them and being sneaky.

Now here is why my food was vegan:
Out of my guests I had:
4 vegans
5 vegetarian
4 muslims
3 jews
1 allergic to shellfish 
1 allergic to egg

At the time dealing with all the different food preferences was overwhelming and I didn’t want anyone to feel left out.
I don’t know why, but I didn’t like the idea of so many people getting a different meal.
I wanted it to be a shared experience and for everyone to be able to participate.

I didn’t tell my family because I knew the moment my brother found out he would get angry that I was catering to alternate diets and religious beliefs entirely. He is extremely against all religious belief and practices, and is very strongly against vegetarian lifestyles. 

The only people who knew were the people that had food preferences, I told them about a month before the wedding to reassure them that everything on the menu would be okay for them. 

The people with allergies were told on the day that that we had made sure not to include their allergens in anything.

Since the food was vegan, it brought costs down so I was able to spend more elsewhere (the pizza party, and cocktails).

Clearly my friend is a talented chef because no one else knew about this until last week.
She actually has her own restaurant that specialises in vegan fine dining, and the pizzas were also from a restaurant that only served vegan food.

My husbands side of the family think its funny, and for the most part are impressed that they didn’t know.
My side of the family however have taken my brothers side and have called me a deceiver.
They said I should have told them so that they could have made the choice whether or not to attend… which breaks my heart.

I asked them: would you really not attend your own daughters/sisters wedding because you can’t not eat meat for a single evening? 
My mother and brother both answered that they would not have attended. 

Now I’m uninvited to my brothers wedding and neither will talk to me.

My dad hates shopping and never wanted to do any of it. I think she takes a lot of pride in giving my brother and I (and now his wife and children) a wonderful and plentiful Christmas morning. As a child, this mattered to me. I admit, I was probably spoiled and didn’t show much gratitude. I’ve also been described as “very difficult” as a child. 

We are now 24 and 27, I don’t think either of us care about presents that much anymore. What I want is to spend Christmas the way we did as children—which is impossible due to feuding cousins, all grandparents have passed, homes sold, etc. 

This year, when she asked what we wanted for Christmas, I said air bnb gift cards. However, on a recent trip to Boston, she had been commenting on the coats girls were wearing these days, suggesting that I too get one. I thought it could be a cute thing to have, one of those really long and classy coats. I’d keep an eye out for If I went shopping (which is rare because I don’t feel very pretty lately and there are better ways to spend time). 

2 months later, she’s decided that it’s an absolute requirement that I get a Camel-colored long coat because “you need to have something to open on Christmas morning!” So now I’m spending my only day off shopping for this coat, that I didn’t want her to buy me in the first place. If I need clothes, I will go buy them myself.

I give her the parameters that as soon as i reach my “expiration date” for the day, we are leaving the mall. Attempting boundaries. In exchange for this, I will drive with her because she wants to spend time with me. We get to the mall, I start trying on what I like, and she starts critiquing the style and the way it fits me. She’s giving me disgusted looks and shaking her head, or acting like what I’ve tried on is weird, which I had actually felt quite confident in. So I’m already pretty much done for the day and my confidence is on the floor, but it’s only been 20 minutes so we carry on. She puts the jackets that she liked on hold and convinced me away from the ones I actually liked.  What she liked was more “classic”, “sleek”, “flattering”, whatever. 

4 hours later, I’ve told her I’m ready to go, she keeps walking into stores. It’s 6 pm and I didn’t do my laundry, grocery shopping, etc.  We get home to her apartment and have dinner. She starts finding a movie to put on. I say “I already spent my entire day off with you and ate dinner with you, I am not staying here for the entire night to watch a movie with you”. She responds “well, it was really only for your own personal benefit” and “sorry it was so agonizing to have your mother buy you clothes”. 

It feels like I could sacrifice my entire self identity for this woman and she’d still be unhappy but “That’s just how she is. She loves you”. What does this situation say about the dynamics of our relationship?

I (24m) have a younger brother ""Tom"" (19m) who was adopted however we didn't know he was adopted until he did the Ancestry/23 thing and confronted our parents about it. It turns out that my brother is the son of my mom's distant cousin and agreed to adopt Tom when they were asked. Tom and I were shocked and when Tom asked for more information our parents hesitated. 

Tom threatened to put everything on blast to the extended family that they relented. They told Tom that while the adoption process was underway Tom's bio grandparents gave them a significantly large amount of money under the condition that they sign an NDA before and agreed to set up college funds for me and Tom after the first five years of the adoption. It was made explicitly clear that this would be a closed adoption and that if any contact with them or their daughter without their permission was made the college funds would evaporate and my parents would have to pay back the money plus interest. 

Tom was understandably upset, pointed out that he never agreed to any of this, wanted answers, and would start making waves in the family to get them if that's what it took. That's when I started speaking up. I told him that he should also consider the long term effects, and if he really wanted to be stuck with college debt for the next 20-30 years? 

Tom then snapped at me and ran off to a friends house. Our parents were hurt but they gave Tom a couple of days to cool off before our mom offered to reach out to her cousins to see if they were interested in meeting with him. That got Tom to come home.

We watched our mom write and send a short email and it took about two weeks for a response and it stated that they had no idea what she was talking about, and that if their youngest child was adopted then she should consider any consequences that may come from digging up old bones. Our mom tearfully showed Tom the email and he made good on his word. It has been a mountain of chaos ever since and it was revealed that Tom's bio mom was our cousin ""Kate"" (33f), who had a mental breakdown after being frequently questioned about it and is now being hospitalized. Tom's college fund is gone and Kate's parents have sent a legal notice that the would be taking my parents to court for breaking the NDA agreement. 

Our parents are freaking out because Kate's parents can hire big dog lawyers while they can't. I make a pretty good salary because of my job and don't have any college debt, and agreed to give my parents financial support each month for at least a year, but I'm not very willing to help pay for Tom's college. Partly because I would have to give all the money I have been saving to purchase a house and partly because I feel that there needs to be some consequences for the actions he took despite multiple warnings.

She broke things off senior year of high school, but got back together sophomore year of college. They’ve been together ever since. 

I used to look at them as the most perfect couple in the world. That is, until they moved in together two years ago. Every time I go over to their house, Ella is starting an argument with him. Every time Ella and I go to the bar together, she gets really drunk and goes on long tangents, complaining about him. She tells me she doesn’t like how bad he is with money, has no friends, isn’t spicy in the bedroom, doesn’t make an effort to go on vacations/cute dates together, and makes her split the bills/dates 50/50 even though he makes twice her income. 

I went to London for a summer internship. The last conversation I had with Ella before I left, she told me she was going to write in a journal every night. By the end of her and Adam’s lease, she would read it back and decide whether or not to end things with him. The next time I spoke to her, she told me they were engaged. I was shocked to say the least. Ella said she was upset I didn’t seem happy for her. She told me I wouldn’t understand since I’ve never been in a long term relationship. “Relationships are hard work. They go through ups and downs,” she said. I told her if she’s happy, I’m happy. There’s been a weird tension between us ever since. 

I don’t think Adam is a bad guy, I just don’t think my best friend has the same confidence and spice for life that she used to.

Not wanting to go heavily into detail but I can’t think of a single person in my family who isn’t an abusive, narcissistic prick. The few that aren’t exactly abusive people are still extremely narcissistic and have little to no emotional intelligence. As a highly sensitive/emotional person with a pretty good moral compass (*cough cough*, autistic), it’s hell for me to deal with these people. 

I’m moving out to my own place here soon and suddenly my grandfather is asking me to clean his shed so we can “get started” on upcycling a dresser he found that we were supposed to work on over a month ago. 

Now, here’s the thing. I would have absolutely no issue helping him IF we had started when we were supposed to. But instead, he decides that we’re going to start today; and by “start” I mean he expects me to clean his shed top to bottom without any source of ventilation. 

As a non-able bodied person, I realistically can’t afford to do that type of labor. But I can’t bring that up to him due to his ignorance and belief that all young folk are selfish, lazy etc. So I reluctantly agreed to “help” him. 

I don’t know how to tell him no without it causing a huge disagreement that ends up making me feel like a shitty person as well as disrupting everyone else in the house for the rest of the day. 

I can’t help but think that this is his form of punishing me. He’s whined and complained for months about the fact that i’ve been living at my grandparents house (i didn’t have another choice other than homelessness and i pay for all my needs and more or less stay out of the way) but since he’s known about me moving he’s been trying to talk me out of it and picking at me in seemingly an attempt to knock me down and get me to comply with his wants for my life. 

I can see how that may seem far-fetched to some and I may be coming off entitled, but after everything my grandfather has put not only me but the rest of my family through, I can’t think of a reason to help.

I asked politely and thought it was a reasonable request, but my mom started arguing with me and telling me I was neglecting my dog and how I didn’t care about her, was being selfish, and prioritizing my own comfort over her ”needs”.

She went on an at LEAST five-minute rant about how I was selfish, a bad pet owner, neglectful, and irresponsible. She repeatedly stating how I wanted this dog, therefore I should let her sleep in my bed despite the fleas and asking me, “Which is more important, you or her?”

We made plans to go dress shopping together and I was super excited. 

MIL has never liked me. She will publicly tell people I'm not good enough for her son (yes he shuts that down) She tries to exclude me from everything, and she is always making fun of my style. I like things very girly and traditional, and MIL thinks I'm so boring. I didn't want her to have any role in wedding planning mainly do to that.

However my mom and MIL are friends and I respect that. They used to actually not like each other, but I think there was some underlying mutual respect like they met their match in each other, but my mom's fiance hates all of my mom's old friends (not in a controlling way, really nasty catty women and I don't think my mom even liked them) and he hangs out in the same friend group as MILs husband. 

I'm fine with them being friends. I was fine with my mom bringing a friend to the appointment (I brought two) but I was pissed when she rolled in with MIL. I immidiatley pulled my mom aside and was like what the hell. She said she threw MIL a birthday party last night, MIL was sleeping in the bed with her, and she couldn't sneak out without waking her, then somehow felt obligated to invite her (but later admitted she loved both of MILs weddings and wants her opinion)

MIL was annoying during the whole thing. She gave my mom a lot of praise, but just was like meh at every dress I tried on, told me ball gowns aren't flattering on me, told me her son wasn't going to like the dresses I picked, and said the dresses remind her of that show my super sweet 16. Needless to say I was pissed. She also gave my friend terrible relationship advice.

The moment I was alone with my mom I snapped at her that she ruined the experience and maybe I shouldn't include her in anything else wedding related as she ruined this for me. I said maybe she should show up at my wedding and be treated like a regular gift.

When we started dating he was really attentive and took the time to listen to anything that was bothering me no matter what. This year I have just started working as a RN in aged care full time and there have been some very difficult aspects of my role. These include; a massive covid outbreak, my first time informing the family that their loved one died and coping with extremely long shifts without a break when I was the only RN in a facility with 170 beds. I would come home physically and emotionally exhausted. I tried going to my partner for support but I mostly just got; ""you should leave those issues at work"" or ""that's just part of your job"". I recently turned 30 during the week and planned a celebratory lunch with my friends and family on the Saturday. On the Friday I worked 10 hours straight without a break and was exhausted when I got home. I told my partner what happened and got nothing from him except to say that I should be grateful that I have a job and to stop being selfish because he lost his job. I completely broke down and told him that I need emotional support from him and he isn't giving it. I told him that my Christmas tree has been more emotionally supportive and called him emotionally constipated. He said I was being silly and over reacting. I told him that he hasn't been supportive like I needed him to be. He got pissed at this and said that he wont come to my 30th birthday lunch the next day if I keep being so rediculous and he can't afford it anyway (but could to afford to go out partying twice the week before with his friend) I told him that I am trying to tell him what I need from him. He stormed out and went to his mum's. The next morning he called me and accused me of being selfish because I wanted to feel special and a priority for him on my birthday. He said ""fine! I'll come then but I'll just sit there and not talk to anyone"". I told him that I didn't want him there if he was going to be like that because he was just upsetting me.

My “friends” A 14f and E 13f and I have known eachother for almost 8years and I have never stopped having problems with them. A who I have known longer has always been a liar and E has just always caused issues.

I don’t exactly remember what they did in primary school but I remember how shitty it made me feel. I also don’t exactly remember if I apologised but I’m pretty sure I did and I have definitely apologised for other stuff. They however have never apologised for anything.

I’m a big believer in apologies even if I don’t think I’ve done something wrong I will still apologise.
 
My friends had been pissing me off for the longest time, I could never tell when my friend E was joking, and she called me a wuss when i took the day off to get my braces on and whenever I’d say I couldn’t eat something because of my braces she’d say something like “I have braces and I still eat it you’ll be fine” my friend A would bully me as a joke, I did it back once but she couldn’t take it, I told her multiple times I didn’t like it and I wanted her to stop but she still didn’t.

One day we were arguing over a celebrities height (which wasn’t the reason I left it was a small insignificant argument) and that was the icing on the cake that made me leave, I went and sat with another group of friends and told them about what happened and what it felt like to me.

The next day my friends were not talking to me, i then revived a message from E saying “what happened to us bullying you” i was so pissed I left the group chat and then was told I was taking it to far. They began accusing me of all this stuff because someone told them what I had said. I messaged them as said I’m sorry but nothing I said was a lie and that I didn’t want them messaging me if they were just going to accuse me Of stuff.

After school they added me back to the group chat and began spamming me with messages and just when I thought we were all good they began getting angry because I had told someone two of them were dating. (2 girls btw) i then replied with “sorry I was upset and thinking irrationally and shouldn’t have said anything,” but they wouldn’t take it.

They all started being nice to me claiming they want no drama.
Yet I’ve still been told I should apologise.

I understand why they were upset because the person who told them what I said had misinterpreted what i said, but I feel they should have asked me about it instead of just getting angry straight away.

My younger son has always come home for Christmas.

My other son lives overseas with his wife. They didn't fly home because it was too far. Before, they would switch off Christmas between my home and my DIL's mother.

This fall my DIL lost her mom. She had come home last year to spend Christmas with her mother and had driven up to visit my younger son and me, but it was weird to see just her and not my son, and my younger son said that to me where she overheard it when she was leaving and was very upset, but he didn't mean it in a bad way, just that it was weird.

This year, my older son and his wife have moved back 5 hours away. But they recently told me they don't want to drive down for Christmas Eve because it will be too hard for them and they intend to only come Christmas day for dinner, stay two nights, then leave. 

When they told me this, I didn't know what to say and I told them I was disappointed and asked why they didn't want to be there Christmas Eve. They both came at me with anger and contempt about how they didn't want to be around a big group of people but it would only be me, my boyfriend, my younger son and his girlfriend. They met my boyfriend and my younger son's girlfriend this past summer when they moved back so they're not strangers. 

My son said they don't have the ""emotional bandwidth to deal with performing and navigating the personal issues that come up in the group dynamic."" 

They said they didn't want to have to pretend to be happy and feel bad about not feeling cheerful, and gave me an ultimatum about how if I didn't understand then they wouldn't come and just my son would come up alone for a visit after Christmas but he wasn't leaving his wife alone on Christmas Eve and day. 

I don't understand why they wouldn't want to be around family and friends and why they feel like my home is not a safe place for them. I set up a room for them and even told them they can eat breakfast and dinner alone in their room if that's what they need. 

My DIL said she didn't want to feel like she had to hide away to feel safe and that she knew she would need to cry at times like on Christmas morning and she didn't want to cry in front of people or feel like she was bringing down other people's happiness. I told her we all understand so it's fine.

I couldn't handle having this conversation over email and they could have called me to talk to me about this so I bowed out. My DIL said she understood and that there were pros and cons to both phone calls and written messages but that it was important that we all talk about our feelings. But when I spoke from the heart I got ultimatums and how is me being upset and disappointed about them choosing not to spend Christmas with me so hard to understand?

My girlfriend begged me to not make a fuss over it and I didn't I just told our parents that I was backing out of paying pay for his next semester but didn't say wht til after they put pressure on me demanding an explanation. They were still not convinced this was a ""good enough"" reason to take the money back and pointed out how it's my brother's education that is at stake here. My brother begged me saying this will cost him delay in school and put him behind his friends. I told him I couldn't care less and that he was on his own.


He's upset and was crying when I left. My cousins defended him saying it's just guy talk and I shouldn't get so worked up over it. They also called my girlfriend a ""snitch"" and said that this was an attempt to drive a wedge between me and my brother.

FIL and his girlfriend came over to see our son (MIL said it was fine) and while he was there MIL and Evan returned from their outing to change for dinner. MIL was happy and laughing, and I saw FILs face change. She went upstairs and he was like rough day huh. I don't envy you today.

I said it was way better than most years and she just had a few tears in the morning. Well I guess FIL taunted Evan about that later and Evan came to me furious and demanded to know why I said that.

I will call her Abigale for Anonymity sake.
Things start out smoothly, going out on dates, bringing her home etc. We have been together for about 5-6 months now. However as time passes in a newfound relationship, it's time to take the rose colored glasses off.
She is foreign, recently moved to the states, and is currently learning to speak English. In order to help her progress, I learned her language. We have differing work schedules (she works day and I work night), which means we can only see each other on the weekends or on holidays. After about 3 months after meeting, I offer for her to move into my apartment. She refuses, stating she wants to attempt living solo for a bit. 
I can understand wanting to have that experience, as I am living it myself, so I decide to patiently wait. As the months pass, I begin to notice that she would not text unless I do so first. She went from greeting me in the mornings, or texting on breaks to not at all. Suddenly, every weekend meeting becomes every other weekend.
 I would surprise her at her home, but she is not in good relations with her parents, and she does not feel comfortable with me meeting them yet. 
Just a few days ago, I ask how she is coming along with her goal of getting her own place when she tells me that she is going to be moving in with a friend and splitting rent. 
This was a breaking point for me. I had been patient with her, trying find ways to spend time with her, and ultimately being accepting of what she wanted.

For the purpose of the story, we'll call my dad's wife Sarah as a fake name. But now that the holiday season is coming up, my dad has asked if I will consider resolving the tension so I could see him and my ailing grandfather. I don't think it's on me to solve this issue, though, which is why I've finally come to reddit for some unbiased answers.  
Some backstory: I came out as a transman at 19. The majority of my family were supportive since the beginning, and only became moreso when I began medically transitioning. I believe this is where Sarah's disdain for me comes from.  
About 6 years ago, when I was 20, I came out to see my dad. He and Sarah are strict on cleanliness (e.g. clean your room, make your bed, etc.) which never bothered me as I prefer cleanliness as well. They had gone out for the evening and I treated myself to a nap in their absence. When they returned, I woke to the front door opening and, wanting to greet them as was proper, I rushed out of my room to welcome them home. Sarah rushed up the stairs as I rushed down to say hello. As soon as I hit the bottom step, she screamed at me from the second floor about how I was disrespectful and began throwing my suitcase and clothing off the banister. She demanded I leave and, unfortunately, my dad did not argue with her. So I left for my mom's house for the duration of the visit and I haven't been allowed back to the house if she's around since.  
A few months later, I was back in school in a different state and getting ready for the Christmas break. Sarah texts me about sending out thank you cards for Christmas gifts. Now, I don't have an issue with it, though we had never done this previous to her marriage to my dad, but she addressed me by my dead name. I responded to the text with ""I don't know who that person is. My name is not that."" I thought it was simple and set a good boundary. She responded to this text with ""check your birth certificate."" I felt this was entirely uncalled for and disrespectful on a level unequal to what I had texted her. I felt hurt and even when I confronted my dad with what she had said to me, he seemed to side with her. This was the moment I decided to go low contact with him and no contact with her.  
Fast forward 5 or 6 years and now my dad wants me to apologize to Sarah about disrespecting her which sparked the initial incident (not making my bed) and that I should not expect an apology back.

I was in the closet and couldn't come out yet, she was very understanding and promised she wouldn't tell anyone. In May later that year, (we had broken up by this point, totally amicably, parted as friends for an irrelevant reason) and a mutual friend 'Ryan' asked if I wanted to talk about ‘it’. I was confused, as we have nothing in common besides school and don't talk much. Ryan (to my knowledge, at this point) did not know that we had dated, nor that we had recently broken up, so I was curious about his question, and he said that Abigail was now with 'Jon', and had actually told him about our past several weeks ago. Cue feelings of betrayal.

The next day, another friend 'Bella' (she and Abigail are best friends but we get along pretty well too) asked if i had spoken to Ryan recently, i guessed something was up, given how coincidental this was, i asked her to just tell me: 

Abigail had bragged about us dating (to another friend group) from day 1 of our relationship, still lying to my face and giving me her word and promising that she wouldn't ever tell anyone. And once she started going out with Jon it gave her the opportunity to start that gossip around the school all over again, still behind my back. Bella said she overheard Abigail talking to others, bragging about both Jon and me. I trust Bella a lot, so I believed her, she also thought that Abigail was 100% in the wrong.

That evening, I got a text from Abigail:

&gt;Hey I'm sorry I told Ryan about us. there isn't really a valid excuse I could give and I don't have one. It was just a careless thing to do and I'm sorry.

I responded with 'but it wasn't just Ryan was it?' She gave me a list of some names, missing a few. (she has a reputation for pathetic apologies btw)

We haven’t talked at all since, mainly because I can't stand to look at her, I'm just so angry she did this.

Weeks later, a friend asked how I felt about this, and I said I was still a bit pissed off, a huge understatement, but I don't like to draw attention to myself at school, especially not after this. The friend then told me that I was overreacting, we broke up 2 months ago, and it wasn't a big deal anyway, I’d have come out eventually. That hurt as we were close, and she shrank my problems, to talk about how her life sucks since she got rejected by this guy. It hurt a lot, seeing as that was kind of an ask for help, or at least sympathy, none from anyone else, bar her and Bella. I don’t want attention, but it was an unpleasant mental place, and I needed support.

It’s now November a year later, and in a school group project, ‘Aaron’ asks 'if I'm a lesbian or bi or what'. I was trying to just ignore the whole situation as I thought I was making a huge deal out of nothing, but his comment made me feel so angry all over again, and now I don't know what to think.

I love my brother but it can get so exhausting looking after him. He can be very loud and energetic.

The catch my old phone wasnt that old it was pretty new (got it in May) because my ""oldest"" phone (i had it since 2015) broke down to a display damage and my replacement was a weak bottleneck phone.  

So the dilemma is that my mother alway told me dont buy a new one just repair your oldest one, i told her No (for the price of repair i could even get a brand new 200€ smartphone), i will wait for the Blackfriday or Cybermonday to get a new one at sale price. (Which i got see P.S.)

She was pissed at me and i told her thanks for your advice but thats my problem not yours. *Shots fired*
And then she was angry again, ranting about family, about love, about that i was greedy (i gave her basically everymonth money after she lost some customers, so how can i be greedy?) About my selfish behavior. Problem her arguments show er emotional damage she has from her childhood whit her parents, and offcourse she excepts me to play her punching bag and accept any insults and ""orders"" whitout any response.  The catch she used sentences that are extremly insulting like, i have born your miserable life you have to follow my wishes! Or, When your where a child i shared everything whit your your never share whit me! Your behavior is Unfair to me!

A sentence that is a lie because 2020 and 2022 i was basically the sole earner of us, sole means even paying even the rent and food. Specially since she lost a lot of clients between 2020 to 2022, clients for house keeping, hair Dressing and Immigration paper work. (Isnt that Ironic? The young useless boy i was is now a sole earner and the Talented gratuadet hairdresser my emotional damaged single mother is now searching for jobs in Astrological prayers)

For context, my boyfriend is a naturally loud person. I, a blk woman, am on the quieter side. I do believe knowing our races matters here.

I (26F) and my boyfriend (24M) went to a holiday light show last night. It was two hours from our home, and we both have very small bladders. Once we got to the small town, we had to use a bathroom, and of course everything was closed and/or not offering a public bathroom. We spent about ten minutes running from store to store looking for a bathroom, and I spotted a grocery store that I assumed would have a bathroom.

We went inside, and walked around the perimeter of the store looking for a bathroom. My boyfriend turned one corner and then headed toward the front of the store, leaving one last corner unchecked. Not all bathrooms have signs above them, so I continued on to the last corner to see if there was a bathroom there. There was not.

As we left the store, my boyfriend made a comment along the lines of “there’s not a sign above for the bathroom, so don’t go check if there is one,” in what I perceived as a harsh, patronizing tone. I add that description because he has a history of being mildly rude when things are tense, and we have been working on it. I followed him to the next store, not saying anything as I was slightly irritated with his tone but didn’t want to cause an argument. He asked me a question but I did not answer, which can be a trigger for him. I found a store that had a bathroom and walked in, rushed in to use the bathroom, then let him go do his business.

Once we left, he asked why I ignored him and I told him that I did not appreciate his tone leaving the store and that I had previously asked him not to talk to me like I was a fcking child, and I lost control of my emotions a bit so I did get louder than I normally am, but I was not yelling at the top of my lungs. He denied doing so and told me to be quieter, then we walked into another store still trying to discuss it. I knew that talking about things would lead to a fight because of similar situations in the past, and I am also a very sensitive person, so to keep the spirit of the night alive I asked him to drop it. He did not, and I got irritated.

By the end of the night things were tense, and he was upset that I did not apologize for my ""attitude"", and said that if the shoe was on the other foot I would shut down emotionally (which has previously happened) and that it was unacceptable. I ended up apologizing and taking the blame for ruining the night, and verbally agreed that I should have apologized for my ""attitude"" sooner. 

However, twelve hours later the situation does not sit right with me still.

In planning, we had a group chat and the question of pets came up. We have 2 small dogs and a cat and love animals so I told them pets were welcomed but let everyone know that we did have a cat in case of any allergies/dogs not used to cats...etc, and that we also have a fenced in yard just in case. Our cat is also super social and loves being around people.

Lunch went great and we were all hanging around the table when my husband noticed my recently engaged friend's golden retriever had a tiny scratch on his nose. He tried to make light of it saying ""looks like the kitty got ya"". My friend got upset and started checking her dog for other injuries (there were none). I took the cat and put her in her room. I apologized and when she asked if our cat was up to date on shots, I assured her of course, then I told her she never goes outside either. I said this hoping it would help put her mind at ease because some cats do go outdoors and can bring outside germs and whatnot in but ours is a strictly indoor cat. She somehow took this as if we never took her to the vet. Meanwhile, my husband, who had gone to the bathroom, heard our cat crying in her room and let her out. The cat ran back to the dining room and started hissing at her dog. I grabbed her and put her away again which confused and upset my husband to say ""just let the dog outside"".

Soon after, my friend and her fiance said they had to go and left. I was feeling horrible and was talking to the rest of the group about how I felt she was still really upset. Sure enough, I got a text from her saying I handled the situation poorly and that we were bad pet owners that only have our pets for show and didn't properly care for them. They had gone to an emergency vet to check for infections from the scratch. Yes, I was a little annoyed of her accusations but I knew he was her baby and thought she was just venting so I apologized a second time and offered to pay for vet expenses. I never heard from her again and needless to say my husband and I were excluded from the wedding and other get-togethers. 

So...could I have handled the situation better?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4853202,public,top,self,AITA for telling my friend our cat is an indoor cat after she scratched her dog's nose?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcb038/aita_for_telling_my_friend_our_cat_is_an_indoor/,all_ads,6,,

I am a SAHM and a part time college student. I just completed my classes for the semester and I am planning to take the next semester off. My husband works from home so he is able to help out with our child during his lunch hour sometimes. He works Mon-Fri and overtime on Saturdays occasionally. He gets a lot of free time during the workday and is able to play video games at least a couple of hours everyday while he is working. The argument we are having is that he wants to be able to play video games with his friends most Saturday and Sunday mornings unless we have plans. I think it is somewhat unreasonable for him to play every weekend. He says that it is only social time because he can't play with his friends when he is working. We do not have any family or friends to help us with the baby as we live across the country from where we both grew up.
