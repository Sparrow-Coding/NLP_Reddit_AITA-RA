In 2021, I (33F) was going through a depressive episode and both my husband and I agreed we move back to our home country. Since I'm a stay at home mom, I took our three kids and went back first while he was held back with work in order to support us and build savings. 

My mom insisted I come and live with her until my husband can go back and then we can rent our own house but my little sister (22F) was alarmed and strongly advised me against it. She said that our mom hasn't changed one bit and I should see how she talks about me and that she feels so upset on my behalf. She cried and begged that I listen to her for once and take the time to heal and if I insist on coming, to rent a house near mom's house instead of directly living with her. 

But the thing is my sister was always against me visiting and she doesn't understand that not visiting at all solves nothing. I am working with a coach to set appropriate boundaries and my mom really changed a lot. I also really wanted the kids to know their grandma and what it's like to have that sort of affection and not grow up like us.

Anyway, at first my mom was so supportive and took care of the kids really well, but I knew some of her old habits won't die just like that. Eventually, she started to go back to some of her old abusive ways. 

But whenever I tried to reach out for support from my sister she would either not answer at all or tell me that she's too busy as it's her final year in college and drowning in projects. And most recently, she said that her phone was broken. 

When she visited for our brother's baby shower this weekend though, she was practically glued to her phone and talking to her friends all the time.

I was so heartbroken and hurt and when I confronted her about it, she still denied that she was avoiding me on purpose. I told her she was just as much a psychopath as the rest of them and that she was punishing me for not cutting off ties when I'm doing my best to slowly become assertive. Is it either I completely leave or she doesn't talk to me? She told me I needed to calm down and we can talk then. Later she took the train back to college and she still won't answer any of the texts I sent her.

He was also at school, mostly playing and developing skills.

One of the moms,F, says she is a professional photographer, specialized in kid photo shoots,and she has her own studio, so she could make a really cool photo shoot of all the kids, we were on board, and asked her to settle her price, and she said it will be like 5 bucks, we told her that that was cheap and she should charge the real cost, but she insisted because her daughter was there too, and she would only charge the paper for the printing. 
So, we did the photo shoot, my son was 2 at the time and was living hell because he hates pictures.
The months went by, and, she didn’t came through with the photos, we were insisting, and she always replied that “later”, “she had a lot of work and she wasn’t able to send them but that day she will”, and a bunch of excuses of that kind.
Finally, 3 almost 4 months later, she sent them, but they are horrible, they are all pixelated, and the kids look photoshopped but the cheap kind, you know as when you go to a touristic place and they take you a photo posing and at the end of the ride they gave you the pic, with giant sharks trying to eat you.
Honestly If she had sent them like that the same day or the next, I wouldn’t have a problem, the thing is that she took almost 4 months to deliver them, and when I asked her to better send me the whole pictures to send them to someone else, so he can do a proper job editing she got furious and said that she should have deleted my son because he was hard to shoot at.

She said they don’t have to be the same style but they do have to be the same color. It’s not scheduled yet, so I have plenty of time to think this over and negotiate if appropriate. 

For some reason this really bothers me. I’ve worked hard to be pleasant with her stepmom under some difficult circumstances. I’ve always tried to embrace the positive aspects of her having another person in her life to love and care for her and to be polite at joint events. 

I always expected her stepmom to be at her wedding and to be acknowledged as part of her family. But having to wear the same color dress feels bad somehow. Like we’re being placed in the same category. I’ve never tried to be competitive with her stepmom and to recognize the role she plays in my daughter’s life but I have always felt like it is a different role than mine. (I’m also a stepmom myself and have a stepson I adore, but I always try to respect his mom’s role as the mom and mine as a supportive additional person in his life without trying to act like I’m his actual mother).

It also doesn’t help that the stepmom is about 15 years older than me and tall and lanky whereas I’m short and kind of dumpy. I always figured I’d end up looking “matronly” in comparison to the stepmom whatever dresses we chose, but never thought we’d have to wear similar dresses, which I feel like will invite people to make unfavorable comparisons even more.

I'm posting here to maybe get a different perspective on this, before counseling enters the picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I have been together for around 7 years, things go very well and we share many interests and listen to each other on topics and hobbies that we're passionate about. She is funny, we make each other laugh, and she is a wonderful mother to our kids.

&amp;#x200B;

However, occasionally in the past couple of years she has said things to me that are funny to her, but at my expense, leaving me feeling embarrassed. When this happens, I usually get quiet and reserved, she notices something is wrong, and the happy mood is ruined. For example, she will make a jab at my nerdiness when it comes to things like classical music, vinyl records, or board games. This is not often, it seems to be once a month, but it keeps happening. I have explained to her that it was ok the first time, but the fact she keeps doing it is no longer funny. It reminds me of the annoying comments I would get in elementary school from others, teasing me. I feel like I should be safe from that in our home with my family. At this point, I usually feel bad that I am overreacting and I should just laugh it off.

&amp;#x200B;

So it becomes a vicious circle, she makes a comment, I get embarrassed, I get quiet, I feel like I'm overreacting to the comment, she gets upset and feels like she is a bad person, I try to explain it's ok. I need to work on this and not take these things so personally.

I go downstairs to my room to play video games while I wait for them to bake (30~ mins) the timer goes off and I could hear it from where I was, I thought I would but alas. 
My Mom yells, clearly vocalizing anger that I need to check the oven, this causes my anxiety to spike and my panic sets in, angry yelling is what causes that for me, and it always has. I go up stairs to check the oven.
While I'm checking, I calmly ask my mom if she can refrain from using that tone to notify me of something so minute, I felt that it was unwarranted and made me panic for no good reason.
She immediately snaps back at me and is now actually angry because she thinks I'm angry with her for telling me about the oven timer, I was not, it was only the tone that triggered me.
I explained to her that that particular angry tone triggers my fight or flight and I do not like it. Her response was to be incredibly offended and she immediately stood up to start a verbal fight.
I explain clearly what the boundary was that I am establishing and she just continued to go on about the oven timer, saying that that tone is warranted, that is clearly where the disagreement comes from.
She refuses to accept and acknowledge the  lear and simple boundary I set and it ticked me off to have that over stepped. I started getting heated up and before you know it we are both yelling about my boundaries (me) and the oven kitchen timer (my mother).
I make sure to try and not interrupt her because she has historically used that against me. She keeps interrupting me but I allow it because we are clearly heated. She then keeps. Claiming I'm interupting her I ask her husband if I have been, he says, ""oh yeah all the time"". A lie that sets me off, because I do my best to lie as little as possible in my life. I say some pretty nasty shit to him as they are leaving the house, which immediately made me feel really bad and gross.

I feel that my husbands family sometime confuse American history with world history and that has caused problems between us. I was born as a Catholic in Northern Ireland during the Trouble (civil war). Catholics before the trouble and during, had limited voting rights, little access to jobs and housing and faced persecution from loyalist groups and the British army.  I myself as a child was dragged out of my bed at night and forced to watch as soldiers beat my parents before taking my father away for interrogation (his only crime was being a Catholic man living near the border). I lost friends and family during the conflict. Thankfully things are much better now, there is still sectarianism in some areas and within the police but with a new generation of more liberal people things are improving.

Recently we had dinner at my BIL house and  the subject of racism came up. I mentioned how I worried about my kids driving and being pulled over by cops (they are mixed race). My BIL stopped and said it was my fault and that if my people would stop oppressing black people there wouldn’t be an issue. I said there is definitely an issue  but I don’t like him saying my people because I don’t like being associated with that. He said my people came over on the mayflower and enslaved and oppressed black people. I told him the Englishmen he was referring to also invaded my country stole our land, stole our language and oppressed us. I reminded him the signs used to say no dogs, no blacks, no Irish. 

To be honest I believe the the whole thing is apples and oranges, but that one groups oppression doesn’t over rule another’s or invalidate their struggle, however my BIL disagreed and said white oppression doesn’t matter.

He just kept trying to mansplain oppression to me. I told him I know what it means to be oppressed, I have lived it. I told him I have tried to educate myself on African American oppression so I can understand better what my husband, children and In-laws face, but that I will not tolerate him calling me an oppressor until he lifts an Irish history book.

My husband said I was too sensitive and should leave his brother be but I feel like his brother invalidates my experience.

But I’m conflicted on if I made the wrong choice or not. 
For some backstory: My fiancé (male, 22) and I (female, 22) are high school sweethearts. This did, however, consist of a *almost* year long break as we each headed in different directions after graduation. During Covid, we were brought back together and decided our relationship was worth working on. This did not start without some very messy drama (in which there were times I definitely was the asshole) but does lead us closer to his ex (female, 19) - we will refer to her as Jenny. Their relationship took place during our break. He says it was “built off of his immaturity and not wanting to be “alone”. That he was old enough to know better than being with someone younger. But thought it could be justified since her parents approved and they had “known” each other a couple of years.” Needless to say, the relationship fell apart. After trying to be friendly with Jenny, I was met with her constantly attempting to “get back at him.” And hurt him in the same way he hurt her. I took matters into my own hands, cutting all ties with her/her family. We blocked them on everything, promising ourselves a clean slate. After all they live on the other side of our state. Our only real connections were through social media. 
Fast forward to the present. It’s been a couple years and we hadn’t heard from them. Until my fiancé and I kept receiving multiple requests from Jenny’s cousin on different apps. We would block and delete but yesterday after another attempt at following me on Instagram, I really wanted it to stop. So, I added Jenny back on Snapchat and sent a very polite message asking her to speak with her cousin about stopping. That if it was her wanting an update, she could have reached out herself. I meant this sincerely, despite us parting ways on bad terms. Turns out my MIL still has her added on Facebook. She has been getting updates since the day she was blocked. One of these updates being the pregnancy and birth announcement of our son. Jenny shared our news with her family, which she claims must have sparked her cousins curiosity (her cousin is much younger, which could explain the lack of awareness to read the room) I was surprised, as we told my MIL the awful things Jenny/her family said/threatened about her son and myself. (Ex. My fiancé and I were *69 (prank called) multiple times one evening by Jenny and her cousins. They said I looked like I came from incest and had the face of a goat. Even went as far as saying they would show up to our apartment to give us a “surprise.” This was one of MANY insults/threats.) My MIL assured us, years ago when it happened, that Jenny was blocked. My MIL has since been texted and unadded her (and Jenny’s mother)

This year my mother got her list in relatively quickly and I promptly bought the things she had told me she wanted the most and my sister would pick from the rest. Presents have all arrived already and are sitting unwrapped in my room.

I ask why and she says she saw the same type of present from a different brand that is cheaper, and she wants me to return the one I got and order the other version. 

I get upset and tell her that it is not even December yet and if she is wanting to change out a gift I don't mind, but she could wait until after she opens on Christmas and switch it out then. (It's not something she will need to use immediately and could easily wait to swap it out.) She gets upset and tells me that my sister had already asked her to do the same thing with something she bought and why am I getting upset about it.

I get that she wants to get all of them done in one shot, and she is trying to be nice by sending it back herself, but it just feels inconsiderate to already be asking for a present to be returned when it hasn't even been gifted yet.

For context, I am a vegetarian and have been since I was eleven years old. This has nothing to do with my health; this was a personal choice. I try my best to not buy products that partake in animal cruelty and I do not eat meat. I have my own chickens and raise them with love, and they literally provide me with the best eggs. I stick to mostly Whole Foods and rarely buy plant-based meat because it’s expensive; but every few months or so I will splurge and buy beyond meat at the store. 

I met this friend at work and the very first time she saw me eating a sandwich with no meat, she made a comment on it and immediately criticized my diet choices out of no where. I told her everything that I just said in the paragraph above. At the time, she just kind of nodded at me and stopped talking about it. 

We no longer work there anymore, but she stayed connected with me over social media. She frequently sends me TikTok videos about how impossible meat is highly processed and not good for you because of the high sodium. I  tell her the same thing every time: I do not care what other people eat or choose to consume, I do not eat meat for ethical reasons and not health reasons. 

Despite all, she continues to send me these unsolicited videos, talks about “switching my diet to keto” quite often, and the benefits of eating meat. 

Yesterday I finally snapped and told her to stop sending me passive aggressive videos like this, told her I’ve never tried to push eating plant-based on to anyone and that she should stop pushing keto/eating meat on to me because it is so rude, and told her she has no respect for peoples boundaries and to just let people eat what they want. 

She immediately turned it on me and told me that she is just concerned for my health and being a good friend, that I’ve always been unappreciative and never listen to the info she shares with me. At this point I stopped replying to her texts, but she continued to go on about how her older siblings (she is the youngest) always pushed diets on to her and she refused them, until she finally caved in, tried keto, and lost 60lbs. 

I have no desire to lose weight, and even if I did, I am not going to do something that makes me uncomfortable. Eating meat makes me uncomfortable and that’s never been an issue for anyone in my life except for her. I am healthy, work out 6 days a week, and have zero health concerns. My diet has served me just fine over the last decade and I seriously have no idea where this is coming from and why she has sent me videos like this for over a year.

When I brought it up to our mutual friend, she said she gets where I’m coming from, but that our friend is just trying to be helpful and bring up conversations where we share mutual interests in *(mutual interests??)*.

We are at a pretty big theme park that has nighttime shows.

A couple nights ago, I and my friend were looking for a spot to watch the fireworks while the girls were on a nearby ride. We found a fairly long bench that had a woman sitting towards one end and enough room for us and the younger girls. We grabbed the spot and the lady told us that we couldn't sit there because she was saving a seat for her daughter, who was grabbing a snack from one of the stalls in the area. We explained that we have a larger group and that there were several seats around us that were big enough for two people, but that this was the only spot that fit our group. She said she wasn't moving because she'd already had that spot for an hour and repeated that we couldn't sit there.

Her fully grown adult daughter came back after about 5-10min and the lady told us once again that we had to move. We refused and the lady swore at us. Now here is where we may be TA. Her daughter started explaining some sort of disability to us, mom said we don't need an explanation, and my friend asked how she was able to stand/walk around a theme park all day without a wheelchair if it was as bad as she was making it out to be. The daughter pointed out her multiple braces but said that she'd just stand instead. 

We got several dirty looks from the mom and backhanded comments, even after our girls joined us. They ended up leaving during the show and a couple of the girls have since been calling us assholes for not giving up our seats and keep bringing it up.

I gave so much and went out of my way to do nice things, and he took everything with a kind smile and minimal effort. Turns out he had no intention of every being with me since he decided to make it official with our mutual friend(F24) and I found out simply by a random gut feeling I cant even explain. No one told me not even our friends as they said they didn’t want to be in the middle, and obviously not his family whom i grew up with because their loyalty is to him. Kind of cruel on his part to take everything someone gave without the intention of caring for them, but also dumb on me for not seeing it. Anyway, that was 3 years ago.

Lately I have been feeling a little off about her. She brought me a birthday gift and i thanked her several times in person for it, yet the next day decided to get extremely upset with me for not texting her a thank you yet again. I was very confused by the reaction. Then she started to push and ask to meet my new boyfriend because and I quote (he cant ask to marry you unless I meet him first). I told her I will not be introducing him to her because i feel uncomfortable about it and i refuse to make him uncomfortable and put him in an awkward situation and I think that i need to keep my distance because i have been feeling off about the relationship and i think maybe its my intuition talking to me. I told her i don’t think she is a bad person and I care for her, but i also think its the end of the road for our relationship. She got very upset which I understood. But then started to try to guilt trip me, and tell me i just throw people away and have no care for anyone. She yelled that she just wanted to meet my new love and that its cruel of me to not allow her to. She then started to say I am not a good person and I strung her son along. At which point I became upset but maintained composure and said “you raised your son to do that, enabled him and did not think to tell me about his new relationship  (Not that she would, she is his mom at the end of the day) and yet you think i string people along and am a bad person?” I left with that and she has been trying to reach out since.

My husband (42m) and I (42f) hosted Thanksgiving this year. My brother (44m) and sister (47f) came with their families, as did our parents. Including my kids, there are 8 grandchildren, including my brother’s son Caleb, who is 13 and my sister’s son Chaz, who is 10.

In our family, we don’t dress up for Thanksgiving. Caleb dressed up like he normally does, wearing a Vineyard Vines shirt, shorts, and Nike. He’s the type of athletic boy who wears shorts when it’s cold out, my brother and his wife have stopped fighting him about it, he’s a good and caring kid who gets good grades. Caleb was also wearing a bunch of those rubber/silicone bracelets, these ones were related to various sports teams. He wears them daily, as do a lot of kids who wear these rubber bracelets, I’ve seen it on a lot of kids. Caleb is the sport fanatic and athlete of the family, he loves these bracelets. He was watching football for a bit before deciding to play with Nick (3m). Nick is the son of the oldest grandchild in the family, Madison (16f), who got pregnant at 13. The dad, Connor (16m), is still around and dating Madison. He loves Nick and is a great guy, but was at Thanksgiving with his family and Nick stayed with us. Connor is an athlete, and Nick seems to be like dad in that regard, he is currently in the same soccer program Caleb was in at that age (Caleb asked to do soccer that young), Nick is a rambunctious kid. Madison is my sister’s daughter. 

While Caleb and Nick were playing outside together, Chaz came out into the backyard. Caleb and Nick were kicking a soccer ball, with Caleb trying to teach him some skills. While no one was outside with them, we could see them through the glass doors and all the adults were in the kitchen/dining room and could see what was happening outside. Chaz was taking photos of what was happening, eventually the kids were called in to eat and it became too dark out for the kids to play inside, so Caleb and Nick went into the toy room to watch some documentary about one of Caleb’s favorite baseball players. Chaz went into the room while they were watching and asked to play Minecraft with him and Nick. As they were playing Minecraft, Chaz made multiple comments calling Caleb’s outfit “gay” for wearing bracelets and made fun of what he was building in Minecraft. Caleb came out to tell us what was happening. He had mentioned that Chaz was taking photos of them earlier. At that point, I ask to see Chaz’s phone, he refused until I offer him candy. He was calling Caleb “gay”, “stupid” and other things to his friends in a group text. 

Chaz is a mean kid and has a history of bullying kids in school.. I told my sister to take his phone away for the rest of the night, she said it would only make Chaz worse. I said if she didn’t, I’d ask her to leave. She reluctantly did and he was an ass for the rest of the night. She blames me, I said she needs to teach Chaz manners.

She's always been a bit porkier than other kids and always loved food. I tried to raise her on healthier alternates, but she just always mindlessly ate. I tried providing her everything- keeping healthier alternates in the house, mother daughter days to weight watchers when she turned 13, I even sent her to an expensive fitness summer camp. She just never took to it, and always got picked on in school for her weight.

This year, my daughter lost her job. She put on even more weight. She has to weigh nearly 260 pounds, now. I've offered her stomach stapling, diet coaches, anything she could want. But she tells me every time, there's no morality in fat. She wants to lose weight, but she wants to do it a healthy way. I tell her fat itself is unhealthy, but she doesn't listen.

This last week was thanksgiving, and she picked some little local restaurant to go to that keeps all their dishes under 500 calories. Her therapist said it's an easier way to manage binging, so I tentatively agreed. 

When we got together, she dressed up nicely, but hadn't lost nearly as much weight as she seemed to be bragging about. She was going on about ADHD being linked to binging, and that she understands her eating disorder a lot better now (she doesn't have one, she's never been one of those girls to starve herself or go throw up), so I just smiled politely and moved the conversation along. 

During the dinner, she kept raving about the food. She loved a good risotto, she loved eating like this. I finally asked, trying to be as polite as I could, wasn't her therapy supposed to help her be neutral about food? It was all, ""food has no morals, food is food, you need it to live and it's okay to enjoy things, it isn't bad to enjoy food and you're not bad,"" but she just kept going on and on. She put down her fork and told me not to do this here, then went on to order two pie tarts.

Two!

I must've made a face, because she rolled her eyes and told me with an attitude she'd already lost ten pounds in three months. I politely informed her, at her size, that wasn't very much and she could very easily be losing more if she made better decisions for herself. 

At that point, she stood up, pulled cash out of her purse, and slammed it on the table. She said some rather choice words, essentially thanking us for proving her right, and left. While I'm glad she had the politeness to pay for dinner, she made a whole scene about it, and now we can never go back to that restaurant. I've been calling her for the last week, but she's sending me straight to voicemail every time.

I just want what's best for her and was trying to be honest. I know she's had a hard time for being fat, and even if people pretend to be nice about it, they're not. They're all judging her and her husband, too.

With the couple owning the largest room. My ex and I separated in late July, and I was diagnosed with cancer at the beginning of August amidst the housing and room sorting chaos from the breakup. In undergoing chemo my mood, fatigue, and outlook had been bleak and I've communicated this to everyone in the house---its been making me very avoidant socially and I'm insecure about my appearance from it. She winds up meeting and dating her new boyfriend in October.

So onward to the story here,  a few weeks back she mentioned having him over and we had a conversation where I admitted I wasn't ready for him to be around yet as per my situation, and that I haven't had the time to emotionally process the relationship ending amidst treatment, work, and school and asked if she could postpone that for awhile. She commented that ""she understood that and didn't really want to bring him around for a long time anyway.""  


As it turns out she's been having him come over when I'm not home/work/other/late at night which I discovered two days ago. I confronted her saying that she at least could of at least gave me a heads up he was going to be around which blew up into an argument in which she insisted she can do whatever she wants and I expressed that I wasn't asking her to put her life on hold personally or socially, but its inconsiderate to me as your friend to do what she did knowing damn well discovering it would upset me that much more. And questioned why she decided to play this like a sitcom with two people under the same roof who you're avoiding running into each other, to which she insists she wasn't plotting or hiding him as she obviously was working around me. Beyond myself, we also have the policy to inform each other when the company comes over, and as I discovered everyone else in the house was unaware too about him.

I don't have a driver's license and I usually come from my town to my workplace by bus. The problem is that on Sundays there is no bus and I depend on third parties to come and return. Some weekends, the sister of my mother's husband (he is not my father) and his daughter come to lend a hand and to return home, I go with them. 

As an antecedent, her niece was angry because I began to attend some tables that are in her area (no one from my area had yet come and those clients asked me because they already know me and I found it rude to ignore them). After that, she treated the customers in a rude way and some gave complaints to my mother, who is the head of the bar. When it came to returning home and barely getting in the car, the niece let me go abruptly and demandingly: ""OP, since we take you home, you must give money to pay my mother and me for the gasoline"" I told them: ""€5 is okay?"" And the girl said: ""no, at least 10"" and I gave them €10 in coins because that's what she was wearing and the niece hurried me to give her the money (""come on"" ""wait, I'm counting it""). 

Shortly after I write to my mother on WhatsApp to tell her and just two minutes later her uncle called them angry saying that they give me my money back and that if they need more money, ask him, which the niece did in a bad way and burst into tears in silence because ""they had asked for €50 to return."" 

Everyone supports me, even my mother's husband (if not, he would not have called them), but they suffer some economic problems and if they had asked me for money in good ways, I would have given it to them without further problems, but the demanding tone did not seem appropriate to me. 

Normally in Spain (which is where we live, so I apologise for my lousy English) they usually offer to pay for gasoline and I do so, but the driver never demands that money and many times they have rejected it. I told my mother that at least they should have waited for me to be at home to talk to them, but she told me that if I didn't, they wouldn't give me my money back because the truth is that I was embarrassed on my way home.

I (F20) and have been dating my bf, “Shawn” (M21) since September. Shawn has a best friend, “Callie” (F21), who he met during his freshman year at college. Most of my friends discouraged me from dating him because of her, but it didn’t bother me because men and women can be friends. I have a guy best friend, “Christian” (M20), who I have been friends with since elementary school. Callie also came out last month as a lesbian, so even if I was suspicious (I wasn’t), I certainly am not now. I have tried to befriend her but she doesn’t seem interested in having a relationship with me (fair enough). 

Callie hosted a Friendsgiving last Friday, and I went with Shawn. We were all having a great time when Christian texted me about plans I had made with him for the following day. I responded quickly and put my phone away, but Shawn saw and asked who I was texting, so I told him. Callie apparently overheard because she started making comments about Christian, asking Shawn if me being friends with Christian bothered him. She also suggested that because Christian and I are both straight, it would be impossible for us to have an exclusively platonic relationship. I never expected she thought this way, and asked her why it bothered her so much when she also has a guy best friend, to which she said “it was different because she’s a lesbian.” I started to feel uncomfortable because I know my relationship with Christian wasn’t like that, that he was family to me (I made this very clear to Shawn when we started dating because I know that people make assumptions about male-female friendships and I didn’t want that to be an issue). I didn’t want to have to justify anything to Callie because it wasn’t her business, and I was getting annoyed by Shawn’s silence as he seemed to be agreeing with Callie, so I made up an excuse about being tired and called an Uber home. Shawn and Callie asked me to stay but I was fed up so I left. 

The next morning, I woke up to calls and texts from Shawn telling me that I shouldn’t have left so early and I made Callie’s comments a bigger deal than they were. He then contradicted himself by saying that he could see where she was coming from and that her suspicions were valid. Callie also texted me saying that if what said bothered me so much, I should break up with Shawn because I obviously had feelings for Christian.

There’s a part of me that feels like I overreacted by leaving, but I also didn’t appreciate being made out as an AH for being friends with someone, especially since I never judged my bf and his best friend for their relationship.

Me personally, I struggled with my weight a lot since I’m underweight, and I tend to eat unhealthy and a lot because of that by choice. One of us, whom we will call Gina, has a shit ton of food allergies, over 25. And the other, whom will be called Oliver is recovering from anorexia, an ED. Emily has no eating problems, but most like has NPD. She would tend to steal food. Some times she would ask, some times she would not and just take the fucking food like nobody’s going to care. But, when we say no, or we ignore her, not just about the food, about anything, she tries to guilt trip us.
“Aww…well I ate all my food 4th period and I’m so hungry…” 
“Aw okay..I guess I’ll just leave then.”
“I’m so so so hungryyy”
Sometimes she will go to an extreme, and sulk the whole time and say she wants to..off herself and say how she “cries every day in her room all alone” because she has “no friends” while we were standing there, trying to guilt trip us. 
She lies a ton too, like she lied about being lactose intolerant then went and ate a cheeseburger. 
Said she was being bullied for being the “ADHD kid”, she isn’t bullied, just ignored bc nobody wants to be around her. 
She makes up stories, etc etc. 
We reported her to our counselor, and she lost it. (by we I mean 4-5 people 🤭)
She lied saying she “never said anything about being depressed”.. when like 4 people heard her say it. She then followed one of my friends to the bathroom, where there was 1 stall available and my friend asked if she needed to go. This was what she said
“Noo..I didn’t come here to go to the bathroom..😞*sniff sniff* I came here to..google how to make new friends on my phone” 
I giggled. 
She even forced herself to cry in front of us, and I know because she kept checking to make sure we saw.

I just bought a house this month and the plumbing doesn't work at all, the water is turned off, toilet can't flush.

We took my brother (19), and my gf's mom and brothers (8 and 10)

All 3 boys had to poop, the 2 little kids asked where we could take them to go bc we told everyone in advance multiple times that the toilets don't work and we can't use them.

 My brother didn't even tell me he had to go or anything, just went in the bathroom and did it, and didn't tell me until he was already in the middle of doing it. 

We were about 10 min away from the house and we would have came back to take him to a bathroom. 

We weren't going to fix the plumbing on that side of the house for a while because it's a 2 family and that unit has a lot of expensive problems so we were gonna wait on that bathroom.

In addition to that, we weren't even planning on going there again until some time next month bc we just got back from there the day before and we were tired (car ride is over 6 hours) and we had just spent $400 on a hotel bc the house isn't livable yet.

So he wanted to go see the house and this was the only day he could bc he has school, so we agreed if he paid for the hotel bc we're out of money.

Hotel ended up being $400

So we also had a dumpster, bc we're cleaning the stuff out from previous owners. He threw a bunch of things in there that aren't allowed and it's $30 per item. 

So this is really expensive and all I asked him to pay is $480 to cover the hotel and gas

My mom is saying us making him pay that is unreasonable (she also told me I should just take a bucket and clean the toilet myself, and that it's my fault for taking him when I don't have plumbing even though there is a restaurant across the street with a bathroom). His incident with the toilet is going to cost us minimum $200 but probably closer to $700.

When I talked to him about it and how upset I was he said ""I'm sorry I tried to make you happy and didn't do it in the backyard"" like how is that better now half my house is gonna smell like poop for the next month at the very least.

I'm 33 and love my mum and realise I'm lucky to have her which is why I feel SO much guilt about this. Shes treated me like a child all my life and my confidence is really low because of it. I haven't lived with her since being 18 but whenever I visit it's the same. I am a manager of a firm and have a masters degree. I'm not helpless and don't have any brain issues.

I have a bro(30) who she doesn't treat like this even though he misbehaved in youth and failed school. I got straight A's and was very quiet. Terrified of stepping out of line. She aways screamed at me in public and in front of friends, for things I didn't do. Bullies would mimic her at school and talk to me like I was a baby. Family members said the same.

She made me apologise to the bullies, sometimes taking me to their house to apologise. They would look out their windows after laughing. I barely even spoke at school because I was scared of bullies telling her I did stuff I didn't do, because everyone knew she would believe them over me. She still tells me things are too hard for me to do, and that she has to help, even really easy things like catching a train.

If I went out with family she'd suddenly start screaming at me in front of everyone, saying I'd done something really bizarre and obscure (like thrown a drink at someone or poured all the soap out the machines in the toilets, neither of which I did) she would make me apologise in front of everyone and drag me home. Even when we found out who actually did the thing, she never apologised.

The memories come back every time I visit (usually to see other family) last weekend she was shouting saying I'd lost her purse (she asked me to pass it her and couldn't remember) saying how could I do this etc and I'd better find it. The whole time I could see her purse behind her on the dresser. But she wouldn't let me talk. So I let her run out of steam and told her and she went ""Oh."" Not even apologising.

She's nice sometimes and does care about me but I feel horrible after being with her. She makes me feel useless and like I can't do anything. It's hard because I have other family members who I love who get on with her and she doesn't treat my younger brother at all like this.

However then she wants me to put on a full realistic Santa costume and deny her presents and call her all sorts of names that I'm not comfortable in repeating.
I was and still am really taken back by this and refused to do it point blank. It's one thing having a bit of role play and fun but i dunno the whole idea of twisting something like Christmas just gave me the ick big time. 
She got really upset and angry that I wouldn't consider it and now is refusing to have sex with me at all, and wants me to eat Christmas dinner without her.

AITA for not taking into consideration more how she'd feel?

We were 'the outcasts' in the early 2000s, me because of a combination of Goth/ADHD and her because of Poor/Autism. There were others in the group but Nikki and I kept in touch over FB despite the long distance. We supported each other in the process of both of us becoming single moms when our exes turned out to be not good partners.

I recently moved back to our hometown and Nikki excitedly set up a playdate between her boy 'M'  (5) and mine 'D' (4). The first playdate was rocky, M had numerous tantrums including throwing toys and sand at D or trying to push him around. I eventually had to hover between the two and mediate while she continued to just speak to me and ignore the issue. It ended on a better note when I gently asked her to watch over M while talking because I was unable to listen to her and help both of the boys at the same time.  


The second playdate ended up being an overnight stay at my place because she had lost her job and asked me to watch him for her interviews the next day, and the easiest was to just have him stay overnight. There were meltdowns and a couple of fights between the boys over toys again until Nikki left and M was calm, on a hunch I gave M a pair of noise-canceling ear protection and that helped significantly, and the boys got along great after that. Further playdates were similar, I figured out that a less populated playground nearby was quiet enough to prevent meltdowns with M. 

Two weeks after the sleepover I woke to D screaming in his room and I walked in to find bedbugs on his wall and bed. Having worked in the hotel industry for a while I knew how to handle them, and got them cleaned up. After two months of constant paranoia, I think it's finally in the clear. During this time D was also very sick from strep and RSV, canceling playdates. I mentioned this in passing when talking to Nikki to re-start the playdates and she admitted that she was fired from her job because they saw a bed bug on her shirt, and stated that her apartment has been infested for years and it's no big deal.  


I suggested ways to take care of it, including contacting housing or me giving Nikki everything I had to take care of it, and she said she wasn't interested. Having had them before during a move and working in hotels I just can't wrap my head around being okay with them.

It was a result of exclusion towards Emma from me and my other friends.

I went on a sleepover to one of my friend's: (Mai's) house with around 4 people, including me. Emma figured out that we were hanging out without her and she started blowing up my phone, calling me on the phone crying asking if I was at Mai's house and texting me saying I was being unfair, which I completely understood her point. I apologised for excluding her, since that was all I could really do. 

The thing is, Emma only texted my phone, she didn't text anyone else's, which I thought was unfair as she was putting the whole thing on me, although it wasn't my house and I couldn't invite her over, as it wasn't my decision. 

I texted her the day after the sleepover happened and explained my side of the story and I asked her to talk to me outside. She kept calling me unfair and said she would speak to the other girls in school the next day.

Around halfway through the school day Emma walked into the class and started talking to us, as we were all eating lunch together and I was finishing some homework that was due the next day. 

Emma explained to us that we were being unfair - which I had been called a million times, already. She left the class crying.

She went to the principal and got the school involved, which was completely unnecessary and didn't need to be carried out the way it was.

I was called into the office mid maths class. I was led into a room with Emma sitting down crying her eyes out. I sat down as the principal began explaining Emma's side of the story, seeming as she was unable to do so. The principal said that Emma thought we were ganging up on her in the classroom and said we were excluding her the whole day. I explained that we didn't think she wanted to talk to us and honestly, how was I supposed to talk to her with the heavy buttload of tension?

It's been three months since then, and I had tried to speak to her outside of the school and meetup so we can sort something out. She said she was busy and I asked when she was able to talk, since I wanted to know where we stood on terms. We never got to talk.

I recently got told that Emma will be moving schools soon, and I keep thinking she's moving because of me, and I've accepted that I did exclude her but I couldn't have done anything about it.

I like to consider most of us “close knit”, live close to each other, see each other every other weekend or so. My (28F) cousin (30M) was sleeping at the Thanksgiving table after dinner. My SIL \[let’s call her G\] (32F) started making fun of my cousin’s \[let’s call him H\] outfit because he looked pretty silly, it was out of character for him and it caught most of us off guard. I mean he wore a “Christian sex club” shirt to our newphew’s first birthday party. From my understanding everyone was giving gentle jabs at his outfit, jokes like: “Who let you out of the house looking like a book writer? Your publisher called and asked for you to button up your shirt!” I was around and heard the jokes. H’s girlfriend was sitting right next to him and was cracking jokes as well. We all laughed it off and moved on with the night. The following morning I scrolled through my social medias and saw that H posted a story saying “it’s hilarious what people say about you when they think you’re sleeping at the table” so I assumed that he heard what we were all saying and I commented “like when G roasted your outfit! Lmao” and then H immediately gets defensive saying that G was causing drama at HIS family thanksgiving. He also says he has receipts of her unflattering outfits. He won’t disrespect his cousin/best friend’s wife like that.

I was flabbergasted at the things he was saying because we were all just laughing about it. It really grinded my gears when he said “MY family”. G is married to my brother and H is our cousin. G has been involved in our family for 5+ years and they have 2 kids together and one on the way.  I responded “I didn’t know you felt this way but if you have an issue you should bring it up with G. You made me uncomfortable with the comment of ‘MY family thanksgiving’ G is my SIL. G is my sister. G is my family. Have a great weekend!”H responded that the comments made his girlfriend uncomfortable and that we were lucky she kept her composure. We were all lucky that he didn’t “wake up” (which makes no sense cause he claims he heard it all)

After that I immediately called G and told her what happened, sent her the screenshots of the things he said and of course my brother was there overheard somethings and told her to APOLOGIZE to H! I was flabbergasted yet again. G didn’t want to deal with any of it and apologized to H and his girlfriend… but only for H to go straight to me and tell me that I was causing drama and I stirred it all up. That G didn’t need that because she’s pregnant. I get a call from G saying that H’s gf has no idea what G is referring to, H’s gf said “its no big deal at all! I was cracking jokes too!”

H is still making this a big deal to me. Saying that it’s all my fault but I really don’t think I did anything wrong. You talked shit about my sis, imma tell her.

Both her mental and physical health have been declining quite a bit in the last year and earlier this year she had to be put in a nursing home.  Most of this year she's still been doing well enough to come to family gatherings and holidays, but she wasn't well enough to come to Thanksgiving.  

My dad had warned me that she wasn't doing well and wouldn't be at Thanksgiving.  She probably doesn't have much time left and he suggested I visit her on black Friday because it might be the last chance I have to see her.  I live a few hours away so I usually only see family every month or two.  

My wife and I planned to go visit and I asked my parents if they'd watch our kids (6 and 8) while we went and visited her.  That's when the trouble started.  My dad seemed confused at first and didn't understand why I wasn't taking them with me.  I have personal reasons for not wanting to take them.  When I was a kid I was lucky enough that some of my great grandparents lived long enough that I remember them well.  But I also watched my great-grandma die of Alzheimer's.  I remember visiting her in the nursing home and the memories I have of her near the end of her life aren't especially pleasant.  I don't really want my kids' last memories of their great-grandma to be her confused and afraid and not knowing who any of us are.  My dad was pretty upset about it.  He thought I was being cruel to both my kids and my grandma by not giving them what might be a last chance to see each other.

At the end of the day my mom agreed to watch the kids and my wife and I visited my grandma alone.  She was semi-lucid while we were there.  She had periods where she seemed to know what was going on and others where she didn't know who I was or was clearly hallucinating.  I honestly don't know if I made the right choice or not.  My dad was pretty upset about it the rest of the weekend.

My husband is an aspiring author.  He has had some success and we hope for more in the future.

When I got pregnant I negotiated a full year of maternity leave with my employer.  I would not lose seniority or miss out of certain aspects of profit sharing.  I'm sorry for being vague but I know many of our employees are in Reddit so I am going to fudge some information.  

In return for the accomodation I made with my employer I got a month of completely uninterrupted time with my new baby.  Then I started taking on tasks from home on my own schedule. On average it was 15 hours or so a week.  

My husband writes at home so we decided that he would be the stay at home parent and when I was working he would care for our baby.  It was a pretty good arrangement I thought.  

And it was for about a month.  Then he would start ignoring the baby crying, or claiming that the baby wanted me. That sort of thing.  It started to interfere with my deal with my boss.  I told him in no uncertain terms that if he kept interrupting me while I was working I would hire a nanny for help, but take the funds out of our fun budget.  The budget that pays for dinners out, vacations, and hobbies.  He got the point and I got my one to two hours of uninterrupted time every day. 

Until recently. It is almost time for me to return to work full time.  Once again my employer was very accommodating. They were impressed with my ability to contribute meaningfully to my group during my maternity leave.  So they offered me a choice of WFH, work in the office, or a hybrid schedule.  I discussed it with my husband and he said that I should chose to WFH so I could help more with the baby.  I chose to return to the office.

I have access to a private room and a freezer so I can store milk.  I am able to interact with my team and I enjoy the environment.  

My husband is saying that I'm being cruel and that my baby needs me.   I said I would WFH if he got a job to pay for the nanny so it didn't affect our budget.  He said it didn't make sense. I almost said 'no shit Sherlock "". 

He wants me to be the main breadwinner while he tries to get published, he wants to enjoy life in an expensive city, and he wants to stay home to write.  Some of these desires are mutually exclusive without him stepping up and giving me time and space to earn a living.  

We just saw his family for Thanksgiving and he was complaining to his mom about me choosing to leave him at home with the baby and returning to work.  She started in on me for my choice. I was embarrassed until his dad spoke up and reminded her that when my husband was born she was a stay at home mom and housewife.  He said that was what my husband signed up for if he didn't want a job. It just became a big argument.

i usually just swipe them away if they’re up, but this time i noticed two girls at the top that he had just dm’d. one being his ex, just catching up, which i really don’t mind. but then another one was a random girl that he seems to follow on everything, and spam likes her pictures. my heart sank and i was so scared because what could he message her about??? i opened it and it was something really harmless about her animal she posted on her story. i was so confused so i scrolled down and did see him talking to a bunch of girls that are questionable, but again just honestly nothing inappropriate just regular convo or just swiping up on their story about something super random.

It's not a teenagers typical act of rebellion or some sort of puberty stage. I 17F am an older sister of two, my sister 16F and brother 12M. We typically fight not like your usual sibling fight, but a fight that made our parents do the typical asian thing. Although my sister and I grown up well, we have above average grades, we are not a problem to society or something. My brother on the other hand acts spoiled and is lazy, before you say anything... I know that he is 12, but what gets on my nerve is that sometimes when he is asked to do something, he'd yell ""I dont want to, I have a game!"" Sometimes even berating our mother. Our father is very well aware of the fact and is always shielding him putting the blames on us. I know as a sister you might think that I might have had the chance to fix him, but no, it seems like he is possessed or something. If things dont go as he likes, he'd throw a tantrum and break everything he sees on sight. Mind you, we have a small neighborhood store, and him throwing his tantrum does not make my mother happy at all. But what can she do? The more he is disciplined the more tantrum he lets out, in the end my mother always does what he wants. You can say he made himself spoiled.

This is where I get to explain why I had yelled at my dad. One evening while my father wasnt home, I hid all the spoons of the house to force him to wash his. But all it did was cause another chaos, my bad on that. But what made me angry was that my dad, who is probably in a bad mood, blamed us like always. But what he did shocked me as he pointed his finger to out forehead so hard it is still red. Dont get me wrong, as asian kids, we were done by belts, slippers, and hangers which hurt more physically. The feeling I felt was more of an emotional hurt over the accumulated anger of being blamed for not being at fault. I yelled at him, and told him everything. But as stubborn he is, he only believes he is right. He will probably be the same as always the next day, but I'm still worried I hurt his feelings with what I did..

We live 3 hours away so see each other about once a week. He’s always appeared to be very honest and upfront, hasn’t played any games, always super affectionate etc. We do have an added element that we have different native languages. He speaks ONLY Spanish, not a word of English. My Spanish is very good but it is sometimes hard to translate important issues or we get confused or have misunderstandings due to the language barrier. 

About a month ago he started having issues getting or maintaining an erection during sex. I realize this is super normal and embarrassing for a guy and I would never want to shame him for this. One weekend it happened several times and he got a little emotional talking later saying he has severe anxiety and his mind starts racing and when he can’t get out of it that’s when he has issues. 

Fast forward a few weeks, things have been fine and I go to visit him for a few days. The first day everything was great (sexually and other) but the second day he had the same erection issues. After the second failed attempt he told me he thinks his ex cast a brujería (witch doctor) spell on him so that he would never be happy. He said he would have flashes of bad thoughts when he tried to have sex. I realize the brujería part is odd but we live in a Latin American country where even if you don’t believe in Santeria it’s still a part of the culture.

He talks a little more about this ex and it becomes apparent that although they broke up two years ago she’s continually been trying to get back together with him, as recently as a few months ago and that the sexual issues started pretty recently after he cut her off for the last time. 

He then reveals that primarily when he has sexual issues it’s because he’s having images or HER pop in his head when we try to be intimate. Of her crying or in the hospital (she has a lot of health issues), or other worrisome thoughts about her. He swears up and down he has no feelings for her, that he cares for her but wants nothing of a relationship but just worries about her health and has a lot of guilt over leaving her and doesn’t “want her to hate him”. 

I told him that for certain something is unfinished with them and he needs to call her and have a conversation either to clear his conscience or to decide if he really actually wants to be with her. I understand having care for an ex and I think that is a good quality but this seems to be more than that if he’s thinking of her when we have sex.  

I told him to call her today and talk to her and that he needs to take a week to consider this situation and come back to me then.

A little backstory:

i live in a really poor country, and most of the people here dont know how to speak/understand english. So teachers here are really not good, because most of the times we dont learn anything except for the things we have learned in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

so me M(14) goes to elementary school in a kinda small city, we have regular classes etc.. 

Since i have always wanted to go to America(not anymore) , from young age, i have always been learning english, and i  know english really good, i am one of the best in english at my class/school.

my Teacher, lets call her Lily.Lily is a great teacher and i really love her style of teacing, but she just isnt good enough, im not trying to judge her, but most of the times we learn nothing, because we need to focus on the thing we have learned in the past, like Simple Tense or Past Tense. So im really mad at her because she isnt a good teacher, as i have said before, she is teaching the same thing again.

Today we had ur assignment, and she has literally marked the mistakes on my assignment because i have wrote ""Cuz"", ""Smth"", cuz i have used some other Tenses we havent learned etc...

I don't have a driver's license and I usually come from my town to my workplace by bus. The problem is that on Sundays there is no bus and I depend on third parties to come and return. Some weekends, the sister of my mother's husband (he is not my father) and his daughter come to lend a hand and to return home, I go with them. 

As an antecedent, her niece was angry because I began to attend some tables that are in her area (no one from my area had yet come and those clients asked me because they already know me and I found it rude to ignore them). After that, she treated the customers in a rude way and some gave complaints to my mother, who is the head of the bar. When it came to returning home and barely getting in the car, the niece let me go abruptly and demandingly: ""OP, since we take you home, you must give money to pay my mother and me for the gasoline"" I told them: ""€5 is okay?"" And the girl said: ""no, at least 10"" and I gave them €10 in coins because that's what she was wearing and the niece hurried me to give her the money (""come on"" ""wait, I'm counting it""). 

Shortly after I write to my mother on WhatsApp to tell her and just two minutes later her uncle called them angry saying that they give me my money back and that if they need more money, ask him, which the niece did in a bad way and burst into tears in silence because ""they had asked for €50 to return."" 

Everyone supports me, even my mother's husband (if not, he would not have called them), but they suffer some economic problems and if they had asked me for money in good ways, I would have given it to them without further problems, but the demanding tone did not seem appropriate to me. 

Normally in Spain (which is where we live, so I apologise for my lousy English) they usually offer to pay for gasoline and I do so, but the driver never demands that money and many times they have rejected it. I told my mother that at least they should have waited for me to be at home to talk to them, but she told me that if I didn't, they wouldn't give me my money back because the truth is that I was embarrassed on my way home.

i had a really bad day, and thought why not pet her, i never tried before but i saw my sis pet her and my dad pet her too, My dad never bothered to clean her cage or anything, and now my turn i put my hand in her cage, she seemed harmless and the moment she knew i let my guard down my god this bitch bit me hard, she literally took a chunk of my skin out. My whole hand was full of blood like i was knife, in anger i took a hatchet and swung at her cage (only hitting the cage) well the cage is very strong so nothing happened to it not a single dent, while crying out loud and then went to the hospital, after that i never my hand in her cage but still took care of her. 

Approximately 6 months ago, I can’t focus at anything, i had lost will to live, i was sitting at our doorstep while thinking about something and then out of nowhere this cat comes and starts playing with me, he was really a sweetheart, that was the day i slept peacefully for the first time in two years, from that day he started coming back everyday, he would climb on my shoulders, my mental health was getting better, three weeks after we met he stopped coming and the next day i hear he was killed by a dog, i cried a whole week. If there is a god, meet me u little shit. 

Let’s go back about a week, my cousin comes to our home, i really hate him, asks if he can pet her everyone says not to pet her cause she will bite him as she did me who really took care of her, he doesn’t listen to anyone puts his hand in the cage and while I thought she’ll bite him good and hard she didn’t even try to get away from him and god that fucking smirk he did while he petted her, that really Switched something in me,she has a habit of asking for snack always if you’re eating in front of her, and she really loves snacks. I started to eat snacks in front of her and not give her, i also time it perfect so that mom either can’t hear her asking for food or she is really busy so she either tells me not to do it or give her a little too (I don’t) now i like to eat in front the parrot and the way she makes her face all cute and begs for food gives me satisfaction and i now think she also started to realise it cause now from cute she makes a sorry looking face only when I’m eating in front of her, I don’t really believe her though because one time i gave up to that face and gave her an almond and my fucking god she snapped in a second and instead of taking the almond she attacked my fingers, Man this parrot is a devil.

Anna is currently in her senior year of high school and will be starting college in another state next fall. Over the weekend, she came to me and said she needed to ask me something awkward and looked very nervous. 

I sat down with her, turns out she wanted to ask if she could go on birth control before starting college (she is still on my health insurance). I was a little surprised, but it is her life and she’s always been a responsible kid. I thanked her for being honest and set up a doctor’s appointment for her. My husband agreed, and said it’s better she’s safe but he didn’t need to know the specifics lol. 

At the appointment I sat outside while she talked with the OB/GYN (if she needs to tell the doctor something that she doesn’t want me to know, it’s better she’s honest) and went in at the end. The doctor decided on an IUD, and I said if Anna was comfortable with it and it’s the best option for her, I’m fine with it. 

I took Anna back for the insertion a few days later. When we got home, she was still in pain so I told her to lie down and take it easy for the day and gave her some painkillers (IUD insertion is no joke) 

My sister came over later that day and asked where Anna was. I said she wasn’t feeling well, but she kept pushing to see her. I eventually told her I’d taken her to the doctor’s for a small procedure (no specifics) and she needed to rest. Unfortunately, the paperwork was still on the counter and she figured it out. She started screaming at me saying it was disgusting that I’m allowing her to “sleep around” and “become a slut” (her words)

I said it was none of her concern and Anna is almost an adult and my husband and I trust her. She wouldn’t stop, and is now not speaking to me. I kicked her out because I didn’t want Anna to hear (or her little brother calling his sister a slut). She told our mom, who called and started screaming too. 

I was livid. Anna is a good kid, she came to me, and was responsible. I left my sister a voicemail that it’s disgusting to share private medical information and she’s not welcome in my home. Same to my mom.

To preface this, I am 22 years old and live with my parents (our culture is unconventional to western culture in that the kids usually live with the parents until marriage). Overall, my relationship with my parents has been great and I've always been thankful for the opportunities I've had. I've been financially independent since graduation and I always contribute to the household to help my parents out since I am living with them.

I've been searching for quite some time regarding a specific truck that I like and I was waiting for the right one to come along. My dad knew this and was assisting in helping me find one. I eventually lost interest in searching due to the high prices so I kept it on the backburner until prices settled. One day while I was at work I receive a phone call from my father telling me that he found a truck that is an exact match to what I was after and he was able to talk down the price for me. I happily agreed and we waited for the truck to arrive at the dealer that weekend. On the day I went to go sign for the truck, my father tells me to stop by a bank so he can write a cashier's check for the full amount of the vehicle. Surprised, I tell him that I wanted to pay for this on my own and that there was no need. Again, he insisted that he'd like to write a check for the truck instead as the interest rates at the moment are quite high. We eventually agreed on these terms:

1. I'd put a reasonable down payment on the truck
2. To save me the money on interest, my father was going to pay the remaining amount via check and then I'd pay him monthly
3. All insurance, additional coverage, maintenance, fuel, and additional expenses were to be covered by me

All said and done, we arrive at the dealership, head to finance, and do exactly what we agreed on. I put $15,000 down, and he wrote a check for $40,000. I immediately set-up a monthly autopayment to my father for $660 a month for 60 months.

Now that I've had the truck for a few days, he's changed his attitude with me. He gets upset anytime I want to drive it and says that it's not my truck and that it's his. I understand that he technically owns the truck, but the terms of the agreement made it seem like it was mine. We argued the other day and I reminded him that he offered to help me with this endeavor, but he responds by stating that it's his and I must ask for permission to use it. He ended the conversation by saying that I'm ungrateful for what I have.

AITA for being upset about this situation or was this a naïve decision on my part thinking it was an act of good-will from my father to help me out with my purchase?

So I'm the second oldest in my family, however everyone is above 21. I graduated college in 2017, my older brother was supposed to graduate before me cause he went to a 2 year college before transfering to a 4 yr program and for whatever reason he didn't and allegedly ended up graduating a year after. After graduation I took up a job, my brother didn't. I told him to, &amp; my dad shut me down &amp; said he was preparing for medschool. Between 2017 &amp; 2022 I took on multiple jobs for experience, and to help my family with bills while paying out of pocket for my masters and I've graduated with my masters. None of my siblings have provided a dime towards the bills even though 10 mths out of 12, I haven't lived in the same house with them, &amp; 2 months out of 12, I stayed at home for only 1 week; yet   the electricity bill alone cost over $500/month. So I told my dad come December 2022, I would be stopping all payments relating to the house/living expenses and told him that every single person living at home with him is above 21, the youngest is 23 and has an apartment in college, oldest is 31, two middle 25 &amp; 26, yet my dad told them not to get a job initially until I started protesting because all they did all day was stay at home, play games/watch movies, eat &amp; invite friends over, while I worked. Anyways now my dad called a metting and said he wants them to bring $200month while I bring $500 and I told him I won't be doing none of that. My oldest brother has never had a job so I told him he needs to pick up one and told my dad he lives with 3 other adults &amp; that they should all come together and talk amongst themselves and figure out how they'll help him cause I'll be taking my name off the lease once it is over. I'm so frustrated because everytime I have personally needed help my dad himself has simply said to me that he was too busy. I don't own a property cause I was hoping that at some point my family would be a little stable then I can buy my home even if it was a tiny 1 bedroom, 1 bath. I turned down 2 potential suitors cause I couldn't imagine bringing a man into my life and not giving him or our new family all the best of me because I had to split between providing for my parents/siblings, our family &amp; possibly his own family as well, and I look back at all my other sacrifices and there's a part of me that gets really upset.

I have twin 8 year olds (I’ll call them Emma and Jacob).
     Emma has hemiplegic cerebral palsy. She wears a brace on her leg and can walk but usually needs breaks. When we got to the green we were fortunate enough to find an empty bench for Emma to be able to rest on which was great because if we sat on the ground it would have been more difficult for her to get up on her own. 
     The way the benches are set up is that they were in pairs, one right next to each other. They also have no arm rests or backs.
     We had been sitting there for a few minutes when a kid (I’m guess was around the same age as my kids) started jumping from the one we weren’t sitting on to the one we were sitting on knocking into my daughter. This happened a few times. I was staring at the parent hoping they would say something as I was getting increasingly annoyed. Not that any kid should deal with that but my daughters balance isn’t the greatest so it just annoyed me a lot. 
     I decided to say something to the mom asking her to tell her kid not to do that. She ran over and yelled at me telling me her kid was autistic and I needed to be I needed to be understanding. Jacob has ASD so I said so and that I don’t understand what that had to do with asking her kid to not hurt mine. She continued to yell at me saying I wasn’t being understanding and that he wanted to play so she wasn’t going to stop him. 
     At that point since she pulled out the excuse of her child having additional needs as an excuse for this being ok I said ‘well just know when your kid jumps into mine he’s hurting someone with cerebral palsy.” The mom then grabbed her kid and said I was a bitch and told her kid he couldn’t play bc of me.
     I told my friend this and they said I was the AH for how I handled it and that we should have just moved to avoid an issue and causing a scene. Now that I’m thinking about it I’m wondering am I the AH?

This year I left my country to travel for a little over a month.
Usually my family cares for my cat and plants but this time my friends ""Amy"" and ""Jacob"" who are dating came up with an idea; they would sta at my place and take care of my cat and plants. It would benefit them as they both live with roommates so being in my apartment would give them some alone time as a couple, plus Amy would be much closer to her job which would allow her to sleep in the morning. Amy also adores cats but can't have one so she was thrilled to spend some time with mine.

A few weeks ago Jacob texted me to tell me that my cat had been chewing on the armrest of my office chair. He sent me a picture and it was clear that the damage had been done over many days so I was surprised that he waited this long to tell me. Jacob uses my chair often as he likes to play on my cpu so I'm doubtful that he wouldn't have noticed big chunks missing on the armrests...My cat has also never chewed/destroyed anything other than her toys so I assumed she acted out because she missed me or that my friends hadn't been playing /spending time with her as I explained to them before I left (she's under a year old and needs to spend energy). Amy also admitted that they wouldn't come to my apartment for days in a row sometimes which could explain why my cat was acting out.

I told my friends many times that if it was too much my parents agreed to care for my cat for the rest of my travel. My friends told me they would be ok keeping my cat so I asked them to cover the armrests or put a spray on the chair that pet shops sell that smells and tastes bad for cats. They opted to put my chair under my desk which obviously didn't prevent my cat from getting to it as she can easily climb on it.

A few weeks passed by and I got yet another picture from my friends showing me the extensive damage my cat had done to the chair. It's simply not usable anymore and I'm quite upset as it's an expensive chair (I have back problems and got a chair that's ergonomic, adjustable in many ways etc as my at-home desk job was taking a huge toll on my wellbeing). Both my friends were aware that my chair was expensive as I rarely spend money on myself and was thrilled to show it to them as soon as I got it.

Now I'd like to know if I would be an asshole to ask that they help me cover part of the expense to repair the chair. I feel like I gave them many solutions to prevent my cat from destroying it, I told them many times that if they didn't have time to play with her my parents could pick her up and I'm also not happy that they waited until the damages were significant to warn me.

I completely lost it as he has the nerve to keep asking for more from me when it's already all about him. I don't get any enjoyment out of it at this point and it's turned into a chore. What I said has really hurt his feelings and he already struggles with a lot of insecurities. He's now insecure about his penis after I said a dick itself doesn't turn me on (what I meant was I need connection and proximity, I can't just get horny by having it shoved in my face or seeing his hard on). Tried to explain the meaning but he just kept saying 'well you should've said that shouldn't you, now it's in my head that my dick doesn't turn you on'. He wants me to show that I love him more and I'm finding it really difficult. I tell him I love him a lot and compliment him but he doesn't believe me. We FaceTime literally 24/7 when apart. I'm very affectionate in person and not sure what else I can do to show this.

So anyway, my boyfriend and I are a 2 hour drive away. Today he said I could have come up on Sunday night and left Monday (today) as I'm working from home today and that would've shown some effort and love from me. I said that wouldn't have worked as I would've drove for two hours to only see him for two hours on Sunday and then only saw him for two hours today on Monday before I had to drive another two hours back. He said that's a horrible thing to say it should be better than nothing. I've tried to come and see him for a day previously and he's said it's not worth the long trip and petrol so I don't understand why he now can't understand my point of view. I bought it up and he said 'Don't try and make it about what I've said before to get out of it.' To be honest, it's not worth it for me - I can't afford the cost of 4 hours driving to only spend 4 hours with him, plus I **hate** the journey.

She had gastric sleeve surgery, lost all of the weight and had cosmetic surgery to remove excess skin and such.  So, she keeps a very strict keto diet while at home and exercises 5 days a week.  Because she is very strict about her diet, when we do go out or have people over, she will sometimes have something not on her diet that just looks tasty to her at that moment.

Now, my family doesn't necessarily diet, but we do eat fairly healthy.  We all exercise regularly.  My sister (22F) may be considered to be a little chunky, but I do not think she is heavy in any way.  I guess you could say that she caries whatever weight she has well.  I've also never gotten any impressions that my sister was self conscious in any way. (Which of course doesn't mean that she *isn't* self conscious)

Because it was a holiday, at dinners my gf would go ahead and eat whatever even if it was not on her diet.  She would counter it by having maybe only one or two hardboiled eggs for breakfast and stuff.  And she was running every day.  I noticed that at dinners, my sister would make snide comments about my gf being able to eat whatever she wanted and not gain weight.  How she was lucky and should appreciate that her body allowed that.  And this was not jokingly, there was a definite undertone of snarkiness.  And this went on multiple times during each dinner and during multiple dinners.  My gf would try to laugh it off but I could tell it was starting to bother her.  So, after dinner on Saturday, my sister was washing dishes by herself, I went in and started helping her and told her that I've been noticing her comments and that I found them rude and she should stop commenting on my gf's body because she has no idea what my gf's day to day diet is and no idea what she's been through to have her body how she likes it. (My family doesn't know about her surgery because it's not my business to tell them).  My sister immediately got mad and said that I have no idea what it's like to have to sit across from someone with as perfect a body as my gf and I should just shut up.  She avoided me and my gf for the rest of our visit.

We're not only from different countries, but also from vastly different environments, none of which seems to be obstacle in our relationship.

One of the biggest differences might be the fact he's from a-little-more-than financially comfortable household, with his own income being vastly more money than I ever had an opportunity to hold in hand. As for me, I've always lived in what many other countries would consider a borderline poverty. I was always fully aware of this fact, but I never either looked for handouts, nor wore my hardship status like a badge. It was always simply just the reality I knew that would stay with me.

That being said, I've always been a giver, rather than receiver. On nearly every apropiate occasion, I prepare a box of gifts that is a mix of candies, personalized things I make by hand and fun little things I can actually affort to buy. They're always a big hit with my boyfriend and (so far) he always tears up when he opens those.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm feeling like things are quite off the other way around.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I didn't talk to him about it, because I simply don't know how to address the issue without appearing terribly shallow and materialistic, but the problem is this - I receive very pricy gifts on things I don't really need or necessarily want. I think the best example would be how on my birthday I received a 200-something $ package of in-game currency and items, where I only really cared about one thing out of it that I can get just by playing the game. All while for the past 10 years or so I've been walking around in boots that I had to glue together, because I can't afford a new pair. The $200 is a lot more than what I usually earn and could easily get me a new pair of very good shoes and probably a new desk too (it's also around 10 years old). He's aware of those and many more facts about my situation.

And of course, I've been very grateful for the gift and I tried my best to sound as happy as I can for it, along with other gifts of such type that I received in the past, but the reality of the situation is, I wish he either didn't spend so much money or me or I wish I could just receive it so I can buy things I actually need and would be genuinely happy with.

&amp;#x200B;

I know he's trying his best to make me happy and spending money is one of his least concerns when trying to achieve that. But it just feels like he's running into a burning house just to pull out mugs and pans out of it.

We were close when she was little and then our mom died and our dad remarried. My sister adores dad's wife and called her mom from almost the beginning and then she later adopted her. Dad's wife wanted to adopt me too but I didn't want to be adopted and I was never in the mindset that she was now my mom. I was 9 when she and dad married and my sister was 6.

My sister has always been bothered by my not calling dad's wife mom and by turning down the adoption. She corrects me when I say stepmother or dad's wife and I correct her if she says our mom (I don't correct her when she says my mom when talking about their relationship). It has caused many problems. My dad put me into therapy and tried to find some reason for me to say no to the adoption, saying it was a good thing to have happen. He also wanted me to drop the step occasionally where I never considered her my mom and I was go as far as saying I don't count her in terms of my parents. My dad's wife has made it clear she would love to adopt me still and wants me to consider it.

My relationship with my sister has gone to hell. We argue a lot. She's hurt I reject our stepmother as my mom. I hate the way she expects me to call stepmom *mom* and allow her to adopt me. I started to avoid her because of the arguing. She started telling everyone who would listen that I was wrong. Dad got us therapy together when I declared in the middle of her correcting me and saying how wrong I am that I could not wait to move out because I won't have to deal with this shit.

We're on our second therapist but therapy doesn't help. My sister has talked about how much more secure she would feel if I called our stepmother *mom* and how much it hurts her that I don't love the woman to embraced us and how she feels like we're less siblings because of it. The therapists both tried to help explain it to her to no avail and she's on me worse than before because she has heard my feelings from me. 

I said I was done with therapy. I told my dad our relationship might just be a lost cause until she can let it go. He told me I can't stop therapy and I would be an asshole to stop when it's important for our family.

Usually I just tell my dad to take me but my sister (senior HS) decided to take an Uber. Now, let me provide a little context so this next part makes sense... My sister had previously gotten in trouble for a string of things and one of them was constantly going on Ubers, without our parents permission. I had also gone on a couple rides with her so naturally, they got me in trouble as well. The thing is though whenever I got on an Uber with her she never told me doing so would get me in trouble so today I told my dad I was going with her on one because I didn't want to get in trouble despite my sister telling me not too tell him about it(more on that later). But when I told my dad he got super angry at me and told me we can't get on the Uber cause none of us are 18. Then he said he can't take us because my baby brother was awake (when he's asleep we leave him at the house with my grandma but we have to take him when he's awake becuase of his separation issues) and he had no baby seat in his truck (my mom left for work and they were in her car). I told him it would be easier to just let us get on the Uber but he got really mad and told me to get out. I left his room and got back to my sister who was really mad at me. She called me a snitch because I told my dad about her getting an Uber when she specifically told me not too. Then she explained that I could have just told him we wanted to get an Uber without putting her name in it. Although originally she didn't want to tell him entirely and that's exactly what I didn't want to do because I would just end up getting in trouble when she's caught. I told her I didn't mean to get her in trouble but she got more mad and said they're gonna blame everything on her so I told her to just cancel the Uber. I went back to my dad who was still angry, to tell him we canceled the Uber but he wouldn't listen to me and just kept yelling at me to get out. Afterwards, my sister told me she was still getting on the ride and it was up to me on whether I want to get on with her. I guess I'm not going to school cause my dad doesn't want to take me and I passed on the Uber.

I really didn't think my dad would get that mad about it but I feel bad for the trouble my sister is probably going to get into. But I just don't wanna get in trouble again so I just wanted to know if this is my fault or not.

TLDR: Missed the bus and needed a ride so my sister got an Uber despite knowing that we previously got in trouble for doing that. I told her I was gonna let my dad know and she told me not to do that or at least not tell him about the Uber. Anyways, I ignored her advice and told my dad but he got really mad.

We’ve moved to a few different places with different roommates throughout the years but we’re currently just living the two of us in our apartment now. We’re young professionals with decent incomes (making around the same) but the housing market is insane at the moment so we’re in no rush to move out on our own. 

When we first moved in with each other, I brought the big living room furniture and the dining set. No one else was offering to bring it and my parents didn’t mind helping me out at the time to buy some decent stuff. All of it is second hand but it’s good quality furniture that can last a long time if you take care of it. Since then, I’ve brought that furniture along to every place we’ve lived and paid to transport it each time. All those times we moved, it was always known that my parents could store it in their basement if we didn’t have room for all of it or for whatever other reason but she never expressed any interest in buying furniture herself to bring. 

Now that we’re both in our careers, she has expressed that she wants to invest in some furniture that fits her aesthetic more. Additionally, she is worried that once we move out on our own she won’t be able to afford to buy an entire living room set and a dinning table. With that being said, she can’t afford it now either because she isn’t the best with money and lives paycheque to paycheque currently. 

I went to see my parents recently and they mentioned due to them downsizing that they can no longer store the furniture they have for my younger sister, let alone any of my furniture. 

Am I the asshole if I don’t want to get rid of all my furniture so she can purchase her own? 

Let it be known that I stated that I’m fine with getting rid of the couch, but there’s 2 leather chairs that I really like and I don’t want to have to sell those off. The issue with that is, she wants to buy a sectional and we don’t have room for the two chairs and a sectional. I know that when we have a sit down conversation about this she is going to get upset and really push me to get rid of them so I just want to know if I’m in the wrong.

I literally have to stay till 2 even 4AM to share my screen to tell him where to look for info or how to navigate a website.. and because he has a bit of an ego, I would explain something to him he would say he understands. We move on, and later I find out he understood nothing. 

What makes this even worse, is that he thinks it’s my responsability to help him because I love him and we’re a couple and he sacrificed his stability for me. And also I shouldn’t complain or be tired because my situation is stable. I work 40hours a week’. I still have paperwork because I’m an immigrant. I have no family or support system here, debts to pay, and 2 siblings to help (financially &amp; family drama)

I’m frustrated because I thought we were partners that see eye to eye, I wanted to help him but not hold his hands through every little detail. it’s exhausting and I can’t even complain he shows me no sympathy. Last time I had my period I came back home in pain I told him my day was awful and I have nothing to eat. his answer was just try to bear with it a bit more u hold a whole day a small trip to the grocery store won’t kill you.
A few days ago I was so tired and stressed with work (it was my evaluation to end my trial period) He sent me 5 motivation letters to read and verify if they match with the programs, so I blocked him.
I gave him some feedback later and told him we’re done. I tried to explain why we’re done, he still doesn’t get it.

AITA for leaving my loving boyfriend because he’s bad at academics ?

My sister told me it’s just a hard phase and he only have to do this procedure once to come, and everything will be back to normal. But in order to be with me he needs another diploma, which means 2 to 3 more years of homework and looking for internships and last minutes exam preps.. I don’t wanna have to babysit him throughout these years, and I can’t imagine if he doesn’t succeed and ends up working a job less gratifying than mine I’ll have to never get tired again. I feel like there is more resentment than love in this relationship.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4833368,public,top,self,AITA for leaving my very loving boyfriend because he’s bad at academics ?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6w5sy/aita_for_leaving_my_very_loving_boyfriend_because/,all_ads,6,,,,,
