Her roommate is absolutely a psycho and when I was at her apartment her Roomate gave me a speech about how if I’m not an anarchist like her I’m not welcomed in the apartment. She looked me in the eyes and told me she doesn’t like me that much and said some weird stuff and it was obvious she was on drugs. So I decided I’m uncomfortable coming to my gfs apartment and staying there. My gf doesn’t have many options as she’s not a citizen and found this room on craigslist so she’s trying her best to get along with her roomate.
I live with 3 more guys and they’re nice for the most part but I’ve never seen them bring guests ever. They’re all in their mid 30’s. 
My gf comes a lot to my apartment and one time we fought and she came to my apartment all angry. One of my roommates saw how angry she looked and got scared. Now every time she comes he will not talk or look at her. I decided it’s best to just sneak her in my room when they’re not home or asleep to avoid getting in trouble. I really need this room and can’t afford to lose it. I pay month to month there’s no lease. When I sneak her in I’m scared to let her use the bathroom or kitchen or talk too loud because the walls are so thin you can hear everything. One time I let her use the shower so she took a shower and left some hair in the shower. One of my roommates saw this got so angry and slammed his room door late at night.
In the morning he was pissed and texted me saying my gf isn’t welcomed there and they don’t want her to come.
I don’t have anywhere to be with her so I kept sneaking her in but she’s always upset that she can’t use the bathroom whenever she wants or get a snack. 
Yesterday we slept until too late and I was late for work but all my roommates were in the kitchen. She offered I leave first so I won’t be late for work and she’ll wait for them all to leave so she can sneak out. She repeated this like 3 times because I was so pissed off so I told her to shut the fuck up because I was scared they will hear her. She got offended with this and told me to just get out of the room with her and stop being a pussy and being scared of them so I did but I was so angry.

I was shocked. I’ve never seen anything like this in my life. I loudly said: “WTF! You just fucking assaulted her!

She never spends money on herself, yet never hesitates to buy little things for my family, or pick up a restaurant check, etc. My mother in law is the opposite. She spends money on herself constantly but nickel and dimes my wife and I on everything. As an example, there was a family event recently that required traveling out of town for the weekend, and my MIL invited herself to ride with my wife and I and stay in our hotel room to save money. She agreed to cover her half of the hotel room, but when she was told that parking was an additional $50 a night, she didn’t contribute to that because “it was our car and we would have had to pay it anyway.” 

With Christmas approaching, I asked my wife for her opinion on getting my mom a gift that I know she would like, but it is a little pricey. My wife was good with the idea and suggested that we should get the same item for her mom. Knowing that there was no way I could justify getting it for one and not the other, I went along with it and purchased two. 

A day or two later, my wife came across something that she said she wanted for Christmas that was about $50. I already had several other gifts purchased for my wife, so I suggested that she tell her mom about it as a potential gift. My wife laughed at the idea saying that her mom is way too cheap to spend that much on a gift for her. At this point, I couldn’t hold back and stated that my interest in buying a more expensive gift for my mom was to show appreciation for all the things she does for us, and I don’t understand doing the same for her mom, when she thinks of no one but herself.

For context, my partner recently broke up with me. His best friend used to come to my class all the time but stopped when he and I broke up. I heard from my boss, who also teaches a class, that this student who we'll call Luna was expressing how she felt awkward coming to class and didn't want to upset me. I said it was ok, it's just a yoga class right? I teach and that's the most interaction we have to have. 

Anyway, she ends up coming to my next class. I ask her how she is and she immediately dumps on me her relationship issues. I do not engage as this is the last thing I want to talk about with her. Thankfully she isn't the only student in class, we had about two others. After class I'm setting down and getting ready for the rest of the day. (My place of work is a yoga studio/crystal shop. I work as a teacher and at the desk and my class days I work the desk right after). She picks up where she left off with her story. Saying she thinks that I will understand what she's going through (she's laughing as she says this). I immediately get so triggered and so angry. I could tell she wanted to talk about what happened between my ex and I. I end up telling her to have a good day and start setting up the shop so she gets the hint that I am not in the mood. 

My question is, would it be bad of me to tell her she cannot come to my class anymore? I don't want to deny her access to yoga, but this isn't the first time she's crossed my boundaries. I always have felt more like a therapist than a yoga teacher or friend with her.  I'm tired of this extra emotional labor I have to endure because of it.

I make 1/3 of what he earn, by working 5 hours 3days/week. So, it is a massive help for us financially.

And mine is dusting, vacuuming all house area, laundry (wash, dry, fold, put away), sort out breakfast/lunch for kids 4 days/week, sort dinner every night, sort out groceries and everything else we need and random stuff around the house. Which is IMO is pretty big list.

And he doesn't agree. He get upset everytime i remind him of his chores. His word ""i already work full-time, what else do you want me to do? Can't i get a day without having to do anything?""

I live one state over so it was no trouble for me other than parking.  He makes good money and I'm happy for him, but he also invited another friend (Zach) that has a lot of ""daddy's money"" and expensive tastes.

Zach insisted on going to a bunch of fancy places he found online (like $60/meal) and I was barely keeping up spending-wise. Admittedly I'm a bit frugal and make enough that it wasn't going to gut my finances, but I certainly wasn't planning on spending $600 in 3 nights of eating and drinking.

That part is not anyone's fault in particular, especially because I could have said stop at any time (but obviously that's embarrassing).

The real problem came a few days later when Joe Venmo-requested $200 for 3 nights in the hotel room split with him and Zach. (This is after we were already squared up from the food/drink receipts.)

At no point did he ever say I would have to pay for the hotel, before or during the trip. This happened a week after I got home. I wouldn't be nearly as upset if it were part of the deal, because I would have budgeted for it. In my mind, since he had the room regardless of my staying there, it should have been free. We're still good friends, so I thought he was just being kind and offering a free stay.

I feel bad because I thought he was doing me a favor and I really don't want to short my friend. I'm currently debating if a conflict with a good friend is worth the $200.

I also have a cousin on my dads side who is my exact age but she grew up on the west coast so I rarely ever got to see her growing up. Once I turned 18, I just kept with the usual visiting pattern as it made the most sense to me. 

First, some background:

Well thanksgiving last year was probably my worst ever. I came up for the week only for SM and sisters to continuously ignore my existence while fawning over my cousin like she’s the next coming of Christ. She’s in nursing school while I’m getting a PhD in math. My SM would always brag about her to me growing up, telling me I should be more like her while always sending her expensive gifts for Christmas. Well the night before thanksgiving, SM begins the ass-kissing of my cousin by exclaiming how she’ll be such a great nurse who will make far more money than anyone in the room. She then turns to me and says very snippily “it’s not like you’ll ever make as much as her while working in academia!”  I responded that as long as I make tenure it’s definitely possible and that her comment was rude and unnecessary. Stepmom begins to shake her head laughing at me and nobody bothers to stick up for me, not even my own cousin. Stepmom followed me up to my room and called me out for being ‘disrespectful’, which I definitely wasn’t being. I then broke it to her that the she is the sole reason I don’t visit often at all.  Thanksgiving the next day was super awkward, and I left the next day without helping to clean up (she doesn’t deserve my help after how she treated me). 

So usually during Christmas they ask me about the next time I’m visiting, thanksgiving. So here’s what I plan to say:

“I’m actually going to be spending thanksgiving in Florida next year, and I know you’ll all understand why.”

My stepmother calls me over to ask for help running a few errands. She asks that I take the truck and go pick up her tax return, grab some fast food, and allows me to also drop off a package at the postal service.

I do all 3. I check her tax return to make sure it has her name on it, and I place it on the center console of the truck. We have a nice meal and talk for a while, but I am completely not thinking about the document. 

Hours later, I get a call from her asking where the document is. Last I remember, I left it on or in the center console. She had apparently driven home, and I didn't make sure it got into her hands. It wasn't there, and now I'm second-guessing what I've done with it. The next day, I get a very angry call from my father asking where it is, telling me what a big inconvenience it is to not have that when they need to file immediately. Apparently, I did not say the words, ""I'm sorry."" I offered to go by her employer and pick up a second one, and I remembered the digital service printed on the front from which she could probably get a digital copy. They're rightly upset. They resolve the problem within a week. No one finds the document. However, my father tells me a week later that she thinks I've done it to hurt her, and that I'm no longer welcome home. She's clearly heated, so I don't really think about reaching out.

She hasn't called or communicated to me except through him, except when her dog passed away and I sent her a text with my regards. She sent a nice text back. I thought this would kind of blow over, and I really was upset that she would say I did this out of spite.  My stepmother and I haven't had the best relationship, but things have been working with distance. We can coexist without issue. My father told me I should apologize, and I said I wasn't interested given her extreme reaction. Still, zero communication between her and I.

My father has been for months telling me I can no longer go over to their house, spend time with him, and last week, I'd been uninvited to Thanksgiving dinner. I messaged my step-siblings to at least say hi to them while they were in town, and got no response until they left. My step-sister said she wouldn't hang out with me until I resolved the issue.

I refuse to agree that this issue is worth such in intense divide. I also refuse to see that saying the words ""I'm sorry"" is enough to rectify a situation that is apparently so big we can't sit down as a family for any length of time. It seems like an extreme game where I am supposed to grovel and take this until I do exactly what she wants. 

My family has been through much worse situations without any response like this, and I feel as though she may be attempting to separate me from my father. However, I have as much evidence of that as she does of me stealing her tax return and throwing it to the wind to spite her. I refuse to be that cynical.

So our dog is 2 years old and he’s an intact Australian Shepherd. We got him from a family breeder who worked them as true Aussies. Fantastic bloodline and temperament, he’s just a phenomenal part of our lives.
We recently moved to Iowa and joined a dog park here. There are no rules about intact dogs not being allowed (a lot of his dog park friends are other intact males and there has never been a problem). It’s an off leash dog park and we pay for a membership. There is, however, rules about bringing a female dog that’s on a heat cycle. 

Well a man, let’s call him Gary, brought his two female golden retrievers to the park. He didn’t tell anyone that his younger puppy (only a year and a half) was on her heat cycle.
We found my dog under a tree with her, stuck together. Because it’s an off leash park, most of the time the owners will chill on a bench or under the pavilion while the dogs run around and play with each other. Within 5 minutes of him being out of my eye sight this happened. When I got over there, Gary stood up from his bench and came over and said “yea they’ve been like that for a few minutes now”. 

So he saw his dog get mounted and didn’t say anything. Then he said “she like just finished her heat cycle, but I think this might get her pregnant”. Thank goodness there was no fight and Apollo didn’t go crazy when he saw her. No other male dogs got involved and that’s a miracle. We obviously exchanged numbers. Seeing as this was her very first litter and she’s so young, I offered our insurance and to pay for the vet visits and whatnot. Even though it was him who brought A DOG IN HEAT TO A DOG PARK. 

He didn’t text me very often but we were just waiting for him to let us know he took her to see the vet and got a confirmation on the puppy numbers and her health. 

Today, he texted me a photo of her with 12!!! puppies. I was in class and immediately ran to the hallway to call him. He hadn’t let us even know the pregnancy was confirmed!! 

Now as we’re discussing care and the future of the puppies (in terms of proper puppy health and wellness and microchipping them so we have responsibility over these puppies that our dogs created) he said he would give us the 5/6 we wanted for $1200. 

We immediately were like, wait that’s not fair, that’s our puppies too! But he says him and his girlfriend are firm on the price and whatnot. I thought this was a partnership between us but now I’m feeling scammed. We obviously want our puppy to raise a son and we have family members that are interested in raising some other puppies.

Am I the asshole for standing my ground?

Fast forward to current day and age that's all I believed till I was dating a woman whose mom works in healthcare and knows all the ins and outs of healthcare.

About 2 weeks ago I had severe stomach pain. Like as descriptive I can be is, I was laying on the ground on my KNEES over the bed with crutching my stomach in pain. I asked my girlfriend what I should do, she recommended that I go to the ER because the pain lasted 3-4 days and I thought it would just pass by. It didn't. the pain got exceedingly worse to the point where if I ate anything it would come back up.

I mention the pain to my parents, and they say I just have diarrhea from ""something bad"" I ate or a minor stomach bug. Believe me when I say that they tried ""everything"" in their ancient old Asian history book of ""voodoo at home remedies"" to help with my stomach pain. Whether that be back coin rubbing and feeding me plain black coffee...

The throwing up lasted for 4-5 days, and I threw up over 19 times. In fear for my life thinking I might get a stomach ulcer and develop something irreversible I ask my girlfriend if the best choice is to go to the ER.

I again go to my parents and mention that I'm in severe pain and I should go to the Hospital/ER, they refuse, and I get so furiously angry that I scream at the top of my lungs and mention that I'm literally in the most excruciating pain imaginable.

I'm sitting in the car with him driving over 40 minutes to the hospital.

I'm on my girlfriend's side of town while she was dealing with other complications, so she wasn't able to assist me. Her parents are extremely supportive and care more about my health than my parents do and they're just disappointed in my family and honestly, I am too.

After the diagnosis at the ER, they rule it as ""gastroenteritis"" and prescribe me medicine for nausea and vomiting that do NOT work whatsoever.

Fast forward through another few days of pain I am literally on the ground again in pain.

They refuse to take me to the ER, and I have to UBER alone across town and back for $100.

I get to the ER for the second time and admit myself AGAIN, I get 0 calls and texts from anyone in my family.

I stay overnight, they run tests on me and discharge me with food poisoning to like the highest. As well as mentioning if I didn't come any sooner, I would've developed a stomach ulcer resulting in surgery.

Proceeding through the next days to a week I recover and all the medicine that they give me is working really well and they really nailed it this time.

Updated medical bill comes in the mail and my dad has the AUDACITY to say, ""Make sure you pay that medical bill, or it'll go to collections"". Which pisses me off. All the words that come out my mouth are ""You worry about yourself you aren't even offering to pay the medical bill so piss off and stop talking"" and I just dismiss myself.

Would you please reply with the requested information at your earliest convenience? You may submit your reply letter electronically to this email address.

The attorney called me back shortly after I sent the email and he was very angry with me. 

He was really angry and basically yelling, kept cutting me off and would not let me speak. He wasn’t asking questions, but just making accusations.

He said that I sent the email to make him look bad and to make it look like he has been sitting on his butt not doing anything. He was really hung up on the wording “a few weeks ago.” He said that the only reason I would have copied the client is to make him look bad. 

He said that he received my request on 11/7 and mailed his response on 11/21 and that I should check my mail before sending an email. He ended the call yelling at me to “go check your mail.” 

Sometimes I’m really bad with social cues. I’m also fairly emotionless and straight to the point, especially with work stuff. He was so upset that I feel like I must have missed something or done something wrong.

I (27F) was very close with my cousin, B (25M). Brother/sister close. B means his now wife, we’ll call her Q (28F).

I did not go out of my way to befriend Q, nor did most of my family. She isn’t a bad person, just not the type of person I hang out with and I am admittedly not the best with people. She did have a tendency (I’ve been told she has gotten better in time) to be crude in polite company, controlling, and overbearing. Just to explain why we all kept our distance, though my family has said she has grown a lot. 

My dad and I own a second home on a waterway that we let family stay at or have small events at if they like. Q and B wanted to have their child’s first birthday party there. Totally cool, fine, more than welcome. 

I start talking to a mutual friend (who is a friend no longer due to lying and manipulation) about how I was going to go down for the party and stay the night there, as it is an hour and a half away and I was about 6 months pregnant. Said “friend” then tells me that Q’s family is going to be staying in every room, and there I’ll be no space for me. 

Now, I was definitely bitching about that in what I thought was confidence. Context: my mother passed, and I was going to sleep in her old room. I did not want anyone else in there, I am just not ready for that yet. I was told that Q’s family was going to sleep in there and was understandably pissed and upset. I should have verified that that with B or Q, but as I trusted my friend at the time I did not think she would lie about that. 

Well, I suppose she showed them our texts because B calls me, of course upset. I explained what I was told, and that I  don’t mind her family being there but was upset there wasn’t a place for me in my own home, especially in my deceased mother’s room. He explains that he wants nothing more than for me to be at the birthday party, and all is ended amicably. 

I find out on FB that they had the party elsewhere and invited the entire family but me. Q had also blocked me entirely online. 

I still invited them to my baby shower and they did not go. I text B on multiple different occasions to send a meme or meet up if we’re at the same event - all have gone unreplied to.

My family says I’m TA because I won’t continuously try to repair the relationship. My father said I’m an ungrateful bitch for not inviting them to my wedding, even though he said they won’t go. After constant berating, I sent them a save the date, but do not want to send an actual invite.

We eventually talked about it a bit and she explained that she was upset because she felt like I betrayed her trust and that I did it behind her back.

I told her I was really sorry but I didn’t feel comfortable being around her when she was that sick, due to me helping my mother that nearly died last year from related symptoms. The doctors have cautioned us that she needs to be very careful until her lungs are back to normal, she’s still in respiratory therapy and I would feel awful if I got her sick from being careless and going around sick people intentionally. I told my best friend that I was sorry and I would still drop by the gift I got them, and the food I made for their party. I told her I would take them both to dinner to celebrate when they were better. I figured she would understand since my best friend was the nurse that checked my moms breathing machine while she was in the hospital.

I (21F) is dating (19M) T for almost 10 months. I am his first long term GF. He and I both are Bisexual. I understand that he had many thing to learn about dating long term when most of this happened. 

A few months in the relationship he used work at a job that was A good pay for students. He used to drink after work ect. He made many friends there. That is a good thing and I’m very happy about since he is more introverted then extroverted. 

They had a staff outing somewhere in a hotel. He shared a room with (25M) A. Who is gay. I did not have a problem with that at all. 

Of course I let him go and have fun with his friends and I know he would get drunk that night. ( age limit is 18 here) they shared a bed and A asked is he could snuggle up to T (while both being very drunk) T answers “I don’t care” 

So they snuggled together. Tconfessed all this a month later. He also told me at that moment he felt uncomfortable and guilty towards me.

I know I have trust issues because of things that happened in the past with my ex and I struggled getting over this. T did tell me he felt like A had more intentions than just ‘cuddling’ 

A has asked them to watch a movie at T’s place and T wanted too check with me first. I said no just because I feel like A had more intentions that just friends.

I did this because my cousin passed away almost a year ago. She is very sad and I know she has changed due to the grief. It's completely understandable since her son passed away. 

So this trip included a stop in Dubai and my mom had old gold she wanted to sell, so did my aunt. They were packing the gold they wanted to bring and I noticed my aunt wanted to sell a piece I loved of hers. So I told her whatever cost they offer you I'll pay. She said she wanted to just give it to me and I said no I'd rather give her the money so she can buy something there and then I don't have to worry or feel guilty. 

Fast forward we are in Dubai, we head to a shop with her and some friends, while they were checking their gold my mom and I went somewhere else, when we got back and I sat down beside my aunt while my mom started checking her gold. I think I asked my aunt if she got to check and she said how they offered her 5k. 

 Once my moms gold was looked at they asked to test everyones.  At that point I knew she was either lying about the price because they wouldnt give my mom an estimate until hers was tested or it was a misunderstanding because English isn't her first lang so maybe she heard 5 k for something else and assumed it was her gold. 

After the lady came back she told us my moms gold karats, weight and value. Another sales rep had my aunts and another persons gold, my aunt refused to get the value determined when it was her turn. I asked her why and said I would pay it. She said she didn't want to sell it anymore and that when she dies she will write everything. I said I didn't want to think of her dying, I just wanted to buy it because she said she wanted to sell it before we got to dubai. (Mind you she fully intended on selling it which is why she brought it on the trip ). I kept begging her to just get it valued so I could know in case she changed her  mind and she started yelling how she wanted to keep it and then told my mom it's haram to sell it in private. I got so upset because why did she tell me 5 k USD then decide not to let me know the actual value once she got booked that she made up the price. 

I think because I never showed interest in the piece up front before  that now she wants to give it to her granddaughter since I like it so much and want to buy it. To rub salt in the wound the next day she sold an earring that she had only one pair of and added money towards the profit to buy her granddaughter a bracelet. So I thought how is selling that gold different and not haram. It just made me so upset so I couldn't look her in the face for a whole day.

I am working part time for my father’s construction business while I finish my AA. We’ve been having issues as a family since 2020 when my father admitted to being unfaithful (repeatedly) to my mother and I found out some things that completely destroyed the way I saw my father. We’ve been trying to repair things but it’s been really hard, and then some good, but overall the relationship hasn’t been the same. 

He approached me in front of his friends &amp; workers and tried talking ill of my sister today bc he didn’t like her reaction to finding out he is dating someone new. My dad keeps speaking about family relationships in front of other people, he has this habit of playing the poor guy because he knows I’m passive and won’t seek confrontation in front of people. 

But he kept going, in front of people that don’t care for our family or who have ever known our family the way it was, so called friends that couldn’t give a shit about him. I felt angry, betrayed for some reason, as if I had never spoken bad about my mom, but when I heard him victimize and use the same manipulative tactics he uses on everyone to get me to feel sympathy for him, I blew up. Why would I feel sympathy for him? He was the one who chose to give up, not only in his relationship with my mother but to us as a father. I lost my father, or at least that version of him that my mother painted to us. The divorce made me realize It was her all along.

 Still, it’s not only his leaving or the way he is living his life that simply bothers me. It bothers me that this thing walking the earth has now taken the shape of my dad. And it might sound like him, but it lies, deceives and it manipulates to fit it’s narratives and it’s out there still hurting us… and apart from the divorce already. He’s unable to recognize his wrongs, he thinks that because I’ve kept quiet and became passive for the sake of keeping a relationship and working towards reparation, that I’ve suddenly became a supporter of his decision and his new relationship. That he can come to me and trash my sister and mention my mother as “poor mommy” as if she wasn’t the victim in HIS decision. It makes me sick. So I raised my voice and said “do you really want to speak in front of people like this?” Meaning if he was taking the freedom to speak on our family, that I could also do it and make him look horrible in front of everyone while at it. He seemed like he understood w/ that little phrase but I was shaking so much with the after nerves of confrontation and so mf angry, that I stormed out, slammed my car door shut and made a scene driving out of the house we worked at.

Some of our friends, not including her, were thinking about dabbling in some illicit drugs. Because of a family friend of her’s who overdosed, she specifically requested that we do not do Molly (the drug he overdosed on). I agreed, with the intention that I would not do Molly while living with her ever or even consume it while around her. 

A few months ago, we were both living abroad in the same country but in different cities (about 2 hours from each other). My friends and I decided to do ecstasy/Molly one night when we went out. About a week later, I was calling with her and some of my friends from back home and I mentioned that I did ecstasy. At the time, I was a bit surprised that she didn’t have a reaction beside asking how it was, but I just assumed she wasn’t bothered by it anymore. 

Two months later, I get a text from her asking if I did molly. I respond immediately saying yes and that we had talked about it months prior. She told me that she didn’t know that ecstasy and Molly were the same thing, then said “Goodbye.” And then immediately blocked me. 

We eventually talked about it a bit and she explained that she was upset because she felt like I betrayed her trust and that I did it behind her back.

A couple days ago, I changed my clothes, showered after it and told her that “I promise the smell is gone”, she proceeds to hug me and quickly runs to the bathroom… to vomit. She comes back to tell me that “she isn’t coming near me at night until this baby comes out”. Proceeds to tell me that she was “right” and that “I am being inconsiderate to her introduction to motherhood”.

She has proceeded to move into our guest bedroom until the foreseeable future, I told her she is overreacting and that it is quite disrespectful. She told me that she isn’t trying to be any of those things, she just can’t stand the smell of alcohol.

There are some things to clarify:

In 2006, my husband who had retired long ago began to explore writing, leading us to starting our self-published book business in 2012. 

I continued working while my husband homeschooled and did business I until I came home and joined him. Our children (25F and 19M now) have always helped with blog posts, beta reads, and emailing formatters, etc. as a family.

That is key: this has always been a family affair. ***My wife and kids read each book of mine three times over and offer very in-depth story suggestions and line edits. So we all edit together multiple times.*** We sell and market together too. So far, our businesses have struggled to take off, but we've repeatedly promised to split evenly all future profits with our kids. 

After many busts, we couldn't find a good editor, so aftet she graduated college 3 years ago, we asked her to edit our novels and she  agreed. Again, ***my wife and kids read each book of mine three times over and offer very in-depth story suggestions and line edits. So we all edit together multiple times, and then my daughter follows up one last time for proofreading.***

Her degree is unrelated to writing and she is not a professional, but she has the best grasp on grammar out of all of us. Sometimes she accidentally leaves mistakes, but we all read several times to catch strays. We of course pay her, $400-500 for each novel.

Two months ago, my daughter moved out and into her first apartment, and long story short, she has told us that she would no longer edit for us. ***She doesn't want to do the three rounds as a family nor the final proofread. Even if we get an editor for proofreading, we always will read three times as a family, and now she is distancing herself from that.***

We are heartbroken and confused. Not only does it feel like she's trying to coldly separate from us, and we would miss her being part of the process, when we asked her why, she could not give a better reason than being ""busy.""

But, she got her first-ever job when she was 24, living at home. She has the same job, and it's 100% remote, and seeing her work at our house last year before she moved, her workload is very light, she took frequent breaks, and just last week said her job is still very relaxed like usual. She's using ""busy"" as an excuse as to why she suddenly doesn't want to edit. 

Also, when she left home, she did not have any friends or a boyfriend, and has not said she made any since, so it's not as if her social life has suddenly exploded. My daughter in general has dropped down to only calling once a week and taking hours to answer our texts, and now this.

We called her out on it, to which she got very defensive. We mentioned we might have our son edit instead, and she became more agitated and said we should get a professional editor.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4835451,public,top,self,AITA for asking why our daughter no longer wants to be a part of our business?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7f10a/aita_for_asking_why_our_daughter_no_longer_wants/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,

Yesterday, they were killed by our dogs, since she liked to keep the cage open and play on some playground thing that they like to climb on. She stepped out to run an errand and came back to find a disgusting scene. Their cage and the playground were both on a table. I won't get into who's at fault (she tried blaming me because I was asleep during the day) since it's complicated.

[Bird tax](https://imgur.com/a/G13zHEe) (SFW)

I don't want to make their cage or remaining food go to waste. I want to buy my own single cockatiel and have it in my room well away from any chance that this incident happens again. My reasoning for this is that having been a dog family for all my life plus many years, some birds with personality, character that whistled and were naturally curious was and is very cool to me. Dogs are very bland in comparison in my opinion, or at least the way their personality develops in our house.

They were like friends to me, a hole that is again empty due to depression and whatnot caused by quite a bit of mental abuse and neglect causing me to not have any real friends.

My mom said their cage will be dismantled and their stuff will be put into storage and might consider getting a replacement a few years down the line due to the bad taste the whole experience left in our families' mouth. She said I could not get a bird, but I don't care. My reasoning for this is that I see her as the cause of the aforementioned mental abuse. She doesn't do it on purpose, but rather treats me and situations in the complete wrong manner, either putting down my skills, calling my lazy, etc. I might (no diagnosis yet) have been born with ADHD, which of course has gone untreated and has been severely aggravated by her behavior and ignorance. This bird would be a small bastion of happiness in a life I see as unsatisfactory and sad.

As I'm growing older I see more and more how badly things have gone when it comes to my mental health. But enough of this tangent.

My grandpa (82M) lives with her in the basement apartment. A few months ago my grandpa broke his window in an attempt to make a makeshift sub-pump (he broke the window and led a pipe out the window to manually pump water out.) He noticed the sun-pump was broken and didn’t say anything to my mom about it so she didn’t know there was an issue. Anyway, there was a huge rain storm and the basement flooded so now my grandpa is in the upstairs space where my mom lives. 
The sub-pump incident is just one of the many concerning things my grandpa has done and he’s had many toilet accidents where he’s soiled himself and doesn’t clean up after himself.
Onto the incident:
My mom called me today to vent that my grandpa had another accident and pooped all over the toilet, floor and vanity. There was also broken glass on the floor. The broken glass was from one of my mom’s cups (that you drink out of), that my grandpa was using to collect a sample. My mom, naturally, freaked out and my grandpa’s response was “I was gonna put it in the dishwasher. It’s broken anyway so what’s the big deal?”
My mom has also told me she’s found his pills on the floor in his room so he’s not taking his meds either. I have repeatedly told my mom that my grandpa should be in a home but she’s not looking into it because of how much my grandpa fights back on the idea. 
With all of this, I don’t want to go to her house while this is happening. I have 2 kids (3 and 9 months old) and despite my mom’s insistence that she’ll deep clean everything, I don’t feel comfortable being there at this time. She’s told me I can’t bail on her. I’ve suggested she come to my place in a couple weeks and we can do holiday baking and she can see the kids but she says we have to do our gift exchange. (My brother will also be there but he lives close by. He also says we should do a day trip at the very least but I’m concerned about being in what is essentially a biohazard cuz my grandpa keeps having blowout accidents and the poop is not contained in the bathroom. 
I know my mom is big on Xmas and wants to see the kids but I really don’t want to be there. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable but I feel guilty for wanting to bail out. My spouse also wants to bail and thinks we should have my mom here. If we didn’t have small kids I wouldn’t be as cautious, maybe I’m just too worried idk.

Now, at the time I didn't know what 'tramua dumping.' was, but I only found out till a few months ago that I tramua dump the 3 people I liked and a few of my friends, which I have apologized for and I have moved on, and me and my friends are all on good terms. However, a few months back.

Me and my friend got a summer job, and someone I knew came in with 2 friends, one of them was one of the 3 people that I lilked, and one of them came in and was high af. And while I was working, I didn't even know who this person was or anything about them, she offered me weed while I was working in the store, I was really embarassed and worried (as I don't do drugs or smoke.) and very uncomfortable, me and my friend hung out with the people I knew and the girl that was high. 

A few months go by, and I get to added to a gc with the girl that was high and a few of my friends. Now, me and this girl only have ever talked twice, and I blocked cuz she was making me feel uncomofrtable. And in the gc, she brought up the tramua dumping I did in the past, and basically she got most of my friends to turn agaisnt me and cut me off. And I'm upset by this, because, 

1. The people I tramua dumped I apologized too and have moved on and we're all on good terms.
2. That situation about the tramua dumping doesn't even her, and she has nothing to do with it.
3. She barely knows me, and vice versa.

Some of my friends cut me off and stuff about this and I got upset, because I have changed since then, but it seems like they have failed to recognize that. 

I was offered to play a small gig this Saturday, and I heard she was going, and I got anxious and uncomfortable when I heard, so I cancelled the gig because I felt uncomfortable. I told the person who came into the store that I knew about it, and she screenshoted our convo and sent it to her, where I get a load a messages back saying 'You're horrible person.' and stuff

This child will also be both my partner's and my parents' (M/F 60s) first, and likely only, grandchild. They are understandably very excited. While my parents make genuine attempts to be kind and respectful to me, I know them to ultimately be the kind of people who have, in the past, completely disregarded my personal preferences in lieu of what they believe to be ""best."" I love them and appreciate their good intentions, but there are many reasons why I share only parts of my life with them, and live thousands of miles away from them now. All this being said, I had such a wonderful relationship with my grandparents growing up that I don't want to rob my future kid of that opportunity, so I am trying to slowly let my parents in more. 

I have asked for only one thing regarding this unborn child; if they feel they want to buy gifts, please only purchase gender neutral things. I said something along the lines of, ""Please, no pinks or blues, no lacy princess or bold Marvel clothes, at least just not until the child is able to show their own interests in them. They'll be born in spring, so let's just stick to greens and yellows and neutrals for a while."" They said their yeah, yeahs and that was that. I said I was serious, and that it was important to us. 

Yeah, yeah.

I wasn't even going to tell them the sex of the baby, because I knew the gender neutral request wouldn't go over well with my mom. It came out eventually that we are having a boy. Later that same evening, I got a text from my mom with a picture of two Christmas ornaments: one was a pink princess castle, and one was a little boy in a jersey holding basketballs. Her text said, ""Now I know which one I'm putting up on the tree!"" 

It is very possible that I saw red because I am pregnant and, not gonna lie, I am volatile right now. My judgment is shit and I am just now able to articulate to myself why this bothered me so much, so I haven't texted her back in a couple of days. I know myself and if I call and try to explain why the gender neutral thing matters to me, down to a freakin' Christmas ornament, it is going to spiral into a thing with my mom that could potentially ruin Christmas for everyone. We tend to have a lot of family over for the holiday and my mom (and I) can be loud.

One family didnt get along well with us due to a sibling rivalry between the our parents…but my cousin’s mother begged for us to bring our cousin here so she could have a chance in life as they couldn’t afford anything back home anymore, both parents cant find a job,her brother has mental disabilities, their close to losing their home, and they barely eat. We felt bad so we helped their family.

Everything was going great until she started meeting new friends. She started sneaking out at night when she knows everyones asleep. Because of this my mom moved her to my place, which is ok with me since i have a few extra rooms at my house. My mom thought she would feel embarrassed of sneaking out because theres a camera.

Sam and I met in freshman year of college when we were 18. We are 32 now. Throughout my four years of college, Sam and I had a very toxic friendship/situationship that was very on and off. Both of us hurt each other a lot and many mistakes were made from both ends. We tried to make the ""friendship"" work during these years, but we ultimately stopped communicating once college ended.

It was a classic situation of having very high highs, and super low lows. We did have a lot of good times, and did care for each other a lot. When things were good, our friendship/relationship (whatever it was...idek) was amazing. 

One of the many periods during college that we made up and were trying to make our friendship work, we were having a deep talk and heart to heart. We came up with a code word that we could send to each other no matter where we were in life, no matter how long it had been since we talked or what the circumstances were. If either of us got the code word, we would drop everything to be there for each other no matter what was going on. And it was only to be used in emergencies when we had no one else to turn to, and we promised we'd always be there for each other even if we hated each other. 

It's been 10 years since college. The last time I talked to him was a year out of college when we matched on a dating app and just conversated for a bit and had plans to meet up, but I got cold feet and cancelled on him. We went our separate ways since.

During these past 9 years, I realized how toxic he was to me and how incompatible we truly were. I chalk that relationship to up to just being young and dumb and a learning experience. I'm now married to someone who is actually an amazing fit for me and moved on from all college dramas and have made peace with the past.

A few days ago, I get a text from Sam with the code word. I felt really bad doing this, but I ignored it. I didn't want to start up the cycle and open the pandoras box of our friendship again. I know we made a promise to each other, but we were so young and I was so full of unclear emotions at the time when I agreed to it. I do truly care for him as a person and wish him well, but I battled my own demons and am at a place in life where I feel truly content.

He sent me a paragraph the next day calling me an AH for breaking the promise and told me that I'm just as selfish as I was back then and that he was stupid to believe I'd ever change. One of my close friends who I confided in about the situation also thought I was an AH and told me that he could've been going through something tough and I abandoned him.

They came from another state which I appreciate. Some of our friends here joined us as well and it was a good time all around. 

Unfortunately the entire time A kept saying he will move closer to us and we can help him take care of the kids. He is recently divorced and mom has been helping him watch the kids (long story on the divorce) . Me and my husband both work and dont have the time for this. Also we are having fertility issues so I am not particularly interested in watching his kids. He is also super negligent of the kids which makes me angry because everyone pretends its not happening things like changing the daiper barely twice a day, going out to smoke leaving them alone, i found the kids almost falling down the stairs at 6 am because he wouldn't wake up to watch them. We have helped him in the past financially but he has never returned any of the help we give yet he buys expensive things for himself (although he tells us constantly that he understands its a loan) .

We told him he wouldn't be able to afford our state on his salary since he makes 17 an hr and it will be very difficult to cover expenses on it and he will not be able to get, the kind of help mom is giving, from us. She watches them almost every weekend. He says he has a girl here who he ""might""  be dating and she will help him.He insists he can no longer live in his current state because of all the bad memories.

I spoke with him alone and let him to know that I don’t ever wanna hear these things ever, nor I want to ever see it in my warehouse.

I am not the one to use your past against you, but when your past has a lot to do with what you are doing now it does. Some of the simplest things in my job he could not remember, it was to the point where he would have a notebook and have to write down everything I said, and he still would not be able to do it or complete it in a timely manner.

*(Her): Did you ask her?*

**Yes**

*Why?*

**Because I don't want you to have to pay for something you don't want to, and I couldn't think of many other Christmas things I would like**

*I don't want her to pay for something that's unnecessary either. You didn't do the right thing by going behind my back*

**I didn't go behind your back?**

*You asked her without me knowing*

**Nothing is necessary, it's a gift. Why do you mind?**

*I'm not happy for her to do that*

**Why?**

**I don't actually**

*Because it's not needed*

**Ok, I don't think any other gift would be 'needed' more. You're allowed to have nice unnecessary things once in a while**

I’m in a dilemma 

I got married almost one year ago and my MOH has not given me a wedding gift. 

I know on the day she said she forgot and the few times I saw her after she kept saying she’ll give it to me and she forgot. 
But now it’s been almost a year and now everytime I see her she doesn’t say anything anymore. 

It’s not the gift I care about but the principle? 

I’m not sure if I should remind her because I feel like she may have forgotten because she does live a hectic busy life. 
Or should I just leave it and forget about it ?

Today, I (F) was supposed to head hours away to spend the night at my friends (F). These plans were made about a month ago.

Last night, my partner (M) made plans with two other couples, relationships to him vary between friends/family with them.

We were both aware that I wouldn’t make it. However, my plans changed about an hour before his plans, and I am staying home tonight, heading out early tomorrow.

He then began asking me if I wanted to go to his plans now that I was free, and I said no- I am gonna take this time to catch up on sleep and relax. 
I understand I might be an asshole for saying no now that I’m free, but I really am exhausted. I’ve been working full time, taking 4 college classes, and being responsible for almost all  the cooking and housework, the only exception being when he wants fast food instead of dinner. 
His plans would’ve only been 2-4 hours.
He said some things about me being an AH and being inconsiderate, I honestly don’t know if I am or not.

We bought our first house this spring and before were living in a tiny apartment with no room for a tree so this year felt special. We got a big tree with lights and after setting it up I pulled out my box of ornaments. Immediately she asked if I wanted to hang them all up and I said most likely though I haven’t seen most of them since childhood. As I start to take them out she makes a few negative comments “why would you want to hang this up?” “You really like this?” etc. I suggest making some piles for yes no and maybe and end up with a good handful in the no pile. She reveals she feels bad because she doesn’t have any ornaments besides one or two from her dad she doesn’t even like and the one we got last year for our first Christmas married. She says she was excited to build our tree together and asks me to only hang up 6 or so from my pile. I tell her no and I want to hang up all from the yes pile because I’ve never been able to hang them all up (ones sentimental from childhood and some gifted to me over my adult years). Things get heated and she gets angry that I’m not compromising. I suggest that I could hang up all mine for just a day so I can see them all and she says “fine, it’ll just be your tree. But you can’t be upset with me for being angry about it”. I tell her I’m disappointed because I was really looking forward to sharing decorating the tree with her and I wish she could put her disappointment away for a little while to do it with me. She accuses me of not allowing her to feel her feelings and I say that it feels selfish for her trying to taking my joy just because she can’t put up ornaments of her own. She calls me selfish for wanting the tree to be all mine, not compromising by only putting up a few ornaments, and for expecting her to feel a certain way about it . We go back and forth with no resolution. I break down crying and she says “fine I’ll try to do my best” then asks why I didn’t immediately stop crying. I’m too upset at this point and suggest stopping talking so I can take care of myself. She says she’s given into everything and doesn’t understand why I’m still upset. We still haven’t talked today.

In my school they don’t separate sexes unless it comes down to an actual game where the other team requests going against girls or boys, most of the time girls and boys practice together.
The other day the coach was asking around to see if anyone was willing to give a girl (15F) a ride home because her parents sent an email saying they couldn’t make it. It was around 7 pm so I didn’t wanna leave this girl here at the school because the school is about 1-3 hours walking to any town. I asked her where she lived, she told me she lived 40 minutes away on car (3-4 hours walking) which was a pain because she lived 40 minutes in the opposite direction of my house, which was 45 minutes the other way. Meaning I would spend over an hour on the road and spend a bunch of gas but again I didn’t wanna leave the girl stranded. When I got to her house her parents were waiting for her and offered me money and Ofcourse I said no, I just wanted to do a kind favour that ONE time.
The next day we had a practice from 6-10 PM, the girl asked me if I could give her another ride since her parents couldn’t make it again and since it was the last day before thanksgiving break I gave her another ride.
Today we returned from thanksgiving break and the girl came up to me again asking for another ride. I was really tired and I just wanted to go straight home because yesturday I worked a 10 hour shift so I said no. I then received an email from  the girls parents (no idea how they got my email) asking me to please take their daughter home because they couldn’t come get her. I ignored the email but the coach stopped me right outside the gate and asked me why I decided to bail on the girl last minute and I had to explain to him that the girl hadn’t asked earlier that day and that I didn’t even know her or her parents.

Background: my wife has been very ill for the past few years with various autoimmune disorders and getting cancer last year (thyroid, got surgery, in the clear after a year (yay!)). Part of it is that her vision is getting worse. She’s not blind, but has issues focusing. Now, she’s had a hell of a week. She was in the ER this weekend, and missed class with finals coming up. I have been experiencing some severe eye strain and light sensitivity with migraines the past week or so.

There was an eagle in the tree outside our home. We tried getting pictures but the window was an issue. I stepped outside and got some pictures. When I opened the door to go back in, she said in almost a panicked way “What if it flies away? You’ll miss it!” I grabbed some shoes and a hoodie since I ran out so fast without them. I went back outside and took pictures and videos. She was inside watching through the window. The eagle flew away and then two others flew up and battled for the tree, then the defeated flew away. Using broken ASL, I asked if she saw it. She excitedly said yes. I took pics of the victor and went back inside. We were chatting and I thought there were only two eagles, but she saw more of it than me because I was trying to photograph three eagles from three directions. She corrected me and said there were three. We were still chatting about how cool it was and there hadn’t been any more activity, so I started to upload the pics to the shared album. When I looked down to do so, the eagle took flight and she exclaimed! So I ran out the door (which is about 5 ft away from the window where we were watching) and as I did so she yelled “you missed it again because you weren’t paying attention!”. I got a great one of it soaring passed the house! I stepped back in and excitedly said “I got it!” To which she replied “No you didn’t because you weren’t paying attention.” I acknowledged I hadn’t gotten the moment it took flight, but I got a really good picture of it in flight. She didn’t care and continued to tell me that I let her down and because she’s dependent on me that every choice I make is a decision for her and I don’t think about it. She said I knew what she meant when she said I missed it and that it doesn’t matter that I got another picture. She said that I got to enjoy the whole thing and she had to struggle to see it.

He called me a day ago to ask for an “emergency loan” as all his funds have been “frozen”, which wouldn’t make sense as he is his own guardian, unless, he did something stupidly suspicious with his money.  

He has been in and out of rehab since 16 for usage on class A drugs. He has seemed fine for the last year and hasn’t asked any of us for anything. 

But, I have an aching gut feeling that is telling me to not send him the loan, so I informed him that I can’t. He proceeded to tell me about all those times that he has done “monumental favours” for me. He carried on to tell me that he really needed it for an emergency and when I asked him for what, he played the “do you not trust me?” card. I continued to stick with my answer. He called me “selfish, conceited and a good for nothing”.

He hanged up, hasn’t responded to any of my messages but has viewed them &amp; hasn’t spoken to his father as well. Nor has he asked anyone else because he knows they won’t give it to him. 

Alas, maybe it was wrong on my behalf to not give it and see me lending him money as a constant threat.

He does it about 6 times every hour in a series of 5-10 knocks/taps.

I am a young woman, single in my 20s he is a larger man around his early 50s.

At first I just tapped the wall back to signal “hey I hear this” and he would stop. As the weeks went on he has decided not to stop. 

So I went upstairs when I knew he was home and knocked on his door, no answer. I did this again the next day and no answer.

Until last night I finally snapped he was tapping and tapping and tapping and I was hitting the wall back, I finally yelled “stop knocking, stop fucking knocking!”

He stopped…for 20 minutes and then went right back to it. So I wrote an email to my landlord complaining about the noise today. 

The reason I’m even asking if I’m the asshole is because a friend told me I was. He said I was hysterical and shouldn’t have yelled. That I should have left him a note since he wouldn’t answer the door. That our building is low income and I’m risking someone’s housing.

The attorney called me back shortly after I sent the email and he was very angry with me. 

He was basically yelling, kept cutting me off and would not let me speak. He wasn’t asking questions, but just making accusations.

He said that I sent the email to make him look bad and to make it look like he has been sitting on his butt not doing anything. He was really hung up on the wording “a few weeks ago.” He said that the only reason I would have copied the client is to make him look bad. 

He said that he received my request on 11/7 and mailed his response on 11/21 and that I should check my mail before sending an email. He ended the call yelling at me to “go check your mail.” 

Sometimes I’m really bad with social cues. I’m also fairly emotionless and straight to the point, especially with work stuff. He was so upset that I feel like I must have missed something or done something wrong.

The relationship is messy. I have a friend who I met about two years ago, I couldn’t ask for a better friend. Although, we play Xbox together and she may only get on when it’s a weekend. me and her had a week off and she went to Denver. We weren’t able to play together sadly. Before I state what happened I would like to say that me and my boyfriend talk almost everyday, for about an hour a day, call or not. We call about 5/7 days of the week. He always expects me to text first, on rare occasions he texts first. Anyway. My friend got back from Denver and it happened to be yesterday (Sunday) so she got online, me and her played for a long time, I’d say about nine hours. I texted my boyfriend about twice, once to say something and the other just quoting my friend. At the end of the day, my boyfriend texted me saying this: “I’m not even gonna try talking to you, kinda upsetting we barely talked today but whatever” I didn’t really know what to say, I responded late because atm I was still playing with my friend. I said in two messages, “...huh...?” And “....I've been playing with(friend) all day...” I knew how it was going to end. He replied “that’s the point, I understand you have friends but I kinda expect you to talk to me a little more..” I didn’t understand. I did talk to him, everyday. He had his discord status’s as stuff like “about to pull a “my R” (Ik the song but-) he Unfriended me. I friended him again and said “what?” He began to tell me that I triggered a panic attack and I obviously care about (friend) more. I said “you never told me” and “I’ve only talked to (friend) once this week..” and I ended it with “just block me then.” He never did but he isn’t talking to me, I feel like shit and need to know.

My company's travel policy is that all flights greater than 5 hours on client mandates are billed in business class. Next week, I'm traveling to London for a client mandate for 12 days. Pretty much all of my travel assignments in the past have been just 2-3 days, and this is my first extended one. 

Because I'll be gone for a while, I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to come with me. I'm not sure if having her in my hotel room is against company policy, but nobody on my team will say anything regardless. 

My company booked me in business class as per their policy. My girlfriend does not earn very well, and so she reasonably booked an economy ticket on the same flights I'm on. I offered to book her in business and pay for it myself, but she didn't want me to as she said she doesn't want to spend so much on flights (even though I'm paying). 

She emailed me her booking confirmation, and I felt really shitty about flying in business while she's in economy, so I called the airline to see if I could upgrade her, and they let me. When she found out, she was not happy about it and now feels all upset about the cost of it.   


She didn't come from a well off background and doesn't earn well herself, so I can understand if she'd be mad about it if I made her pay, but I paid for it myself, because I wanted to treat the woman I love.

We stopped on the sidewalk as my neighbor pulled into her driveway. Neighbor looked directly at us and smiled. We keep walking, and 1 minute later the neighbor’s dog comes running after myself and my two dogs. 

Neighbor’s son comes out and chases their dog. My puppy breaks his collar and sprints off. 

My older dog ignores me and tries to fight the loose dog. 

I ran after the puppy because he was loose and small. I didn’t want him to run into the street and get hit by a car. Plus I didn’t know where he might be running. (Luckily he ran to my front door. He was so scared he peed at the door.)

I left the big dog to fight the loose neighbor dog. 

It was maybe a 30-45 seconds from when the dog ran at us, to me chasing the puppy down, and then getting back to my big dog fighting the loose dog. 

At that point, I pick up my older dog (80 lbs) and take her home. We were literally 1 house away from my doorstep. 

After both my dogs were back home, I went back to the neighbors to confront them. (Btw I’ve lived here almost a year and never spoken to these people). 

I said “Hey, I’ve seen your dog off leash more than just this once. You need to keep them on a leash.”

Neighbor mom and son both say, “it was an accident, dog got out because mom got home and opened garage.”

I say something like “you need to control your dog. If they get out every time someone opens the garage than it’s not an accident. Keep your dog on a leash.”

Then the mom says to me “you keep control of your dog.”

So, my mom lives in another state and is visiting. My friend invited us both to spend the day at her house. Before lunch time, I had to run before lunchtime because of an emergency and my friend was all too happy to entertain mom by herself.

I was in the house when mom called and demanded I go get her right now. I tried to ask her what happened but she hung up on me. When I got there, I noticed the atmosphere was full of tension and I decided to take my mother to the car first. I asked her what happened and she said that my friend had left her starving, let her wash the dishes, and didn't bother to come up with subjects for conversation. She said that she will never be coming to her house again, that I always find these dirty sluts to befriend and have no standards...etc

 I knew what tirade she will be going on and told her I needed to get something and went back to my friend's house. I then asked her if it's true that she didn't offer my mom anything to eat. She was shocked and said that no, she had already made lunch and was preparing for dinner for us like she always does. She said my mom was the one who wouldn't eat and criticized her food and accused her of disrespecting her by making such a small portion.

I knew indeed my friend is not a fan of waste and wouldn't make too much food and tried to tactfully tell her that where my mom is from, it's considered extremely rude not to be generous to your guests. She got defensive and told me that she had prepared plenty of food. I told her okay, what about washing the dishes? She said that my mom offered and she didn't refuse. She also did put some nuts and almonds and the like on the table for her to snack on and that my mom was the weird one for making something out of nothing. She got mad at me questioning her and told me not to bring my mom again in the future.

I told her that's my mom and if she's not welcome here then I am not either and that she disrespected in a major way but wouldn't take responsibility for it. I was quite sure of myself at that time and really angry.

When I told what happened to my sister though, she said something that made me reconsider my actions. She said I got played by our mother, that she never liked any of my friends and would never allow me to have ones. She said she's isolating me on purpose.

But idk. I still feel like my friend should have been mindful of her guest's culture.
