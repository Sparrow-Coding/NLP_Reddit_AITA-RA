She kicked me out of the car, and then drove to my cousin's house. 

We got to their house, and picked them up to go to lunch, and walking around. When I came home, she was screaming at me because I stole the car, and there were 2 credit card charges. She kept asking who I bought lunch for, when I actually went back to order a dessert. I wanted to shut her up so I lied, saying I paid for my cousin. When my mom asked my aunt about this, it came up pretty quickly I lied, and I admitted to everyone involved that I lied. 

I didn't think much of this until later on in the night, when, I realized they got into a huge fight after the first text between my mom and aunt, demanding that my cousin pays me back, even after it was apparent that I lied. 

My mom and aunt were fighting before (Unrelated to this incident), and I was told by my mom that this fight was my fault, and I caused a ton of problems.

On November 6, my friends family came over to visit my dad that had just gotten out of the hospital a few weeks before this happened, me and my friend were playing on his switch in the dining room, wich is beside the living room where my dad was sleeping at that time, we will call him mark. Mark had a sister, we will call her Cassidy, she is younger then him, Cassidy wanted to play play with me but I played with her earlier so I said no. Then mark and Cassidy were arguing and being loud, me and my older sister were telling them to be quiet cuz my dad was trying to sleep, but they weren’t listening. We moved outside and sat at a different table but Cassidy was still annoying us, and Mark was still being a bit loud, There was a sauce bowl behind the switch, SO Cassidy spilled it on the corner of the switch and MARK YELLED, he was yelling at Cassidy and even tried to hurt her, PHYSICALLY. We kept trying to shut mark up because he was being to loud, and to be honest the SWITCH WAS FINE. But he said it was broken, and the switch didn’t even belong to him.  His family was telling him to calm down, they made him go sit in their van because he was still yelling, but he kept trying to come back and attack Cassidy. We scolded the both of them, but mark was still pissed.

November 25 at 8pm Mark texted me.
He was saying shit like it was all my fault, that he was disappointed in me, I should be ashamed of myself. He was also blaming me for everything, like how I made  us sit at the bad table. He was telling me to use my eyes and shit like that and it was my fault that I almost woke up my dad.He also wanted an apology, but I didn’t.
I told my friend and sisters about this and they were all siding with me. Me and my friend said that he needed to control his emotions. Btw when he texted me this his grammar was not that good so when I showed my friend she told me instead of replying I should correct his grammar. Wich was funny and my sister was telling me to block him, but I wanna see if he says anything else. And also I didn’t reply to him and I don’t plan on it.

I (44f) got married to my husband (47m) earlier this year. He came to where I used to live and where my daughter (16f) has went to school her entire life for work yet we moved back to where he and his son (14m) are from when we got married and this is my daughters first year at this school. 

When we moved into this house my daughter agreed to take the room that was quite a bit bigger but had no direct access to the bathroom and my step-son took the smaller room with direct access to their upstairs bathroom, however my daughter uses the downstairs one as her own. But if its urgent or guests are over they can use my step-sons. However in this room he has a wall filled with nerdy poster stuff which I think is quite dumb as he is 14 and should be past such things. Some examples of what he has on the wall. A poster of the cover for the first super man comic, some weird pokemon art thing on wood, a weird poster that opens like a scroll from this cartoon called ""death note"" and a poster of what he says is the Joker and Harley Quinn, along with numerous other miscellaneous things. the ones that I listed are simply the nerdiest. I have asked my husband to tell him to remove it but he said that it's his room and I have chosen not to argue much about this topic.

Anyways, earlier this week  on Wednesday, my daughter had some friends over. One of them had an injured leg and was on crutches. She lives in apartment so she doesn't have any experience using them on stairs so it was already quite a hassle to get up to my daughters bedroom. She asked where the bathroom was. She felt bad making her go down the stairs again so she told her that if she left, first door on the left, then the bathrooms in there.

When she came back she asked, is that your brothers room. My daughter said step-brother, all the posters he has are pretty cringe. Her friend said that she didn't think they were. My daughter said that it was alright and they didn't need to lie. Apparently her friend just chuckled and said ok, and they moved on. Later that day when they left and my step-son came back from the activity he was at my daughter told him that his room was an embarrassment. I agreed as anyone that came to the house would have to see that abomination at some point or another and I didn't want them too, as it ruined the nice look and feel the rest of the house has.

 We made him take them all down, and when my husband came back he was furious and called me and my daughter shallow and pretentious. I told him wanting his kid to grow up and wanting a nice looking house are simply the bare minimum. He told me that he would not let his own son be mistreated in his house and let him put them all back up, and told me that I couldn't speak to him that way, and that I was awful for doing so. I am starting to to believe that my husband is right and that I shouldn't have been so rude to him.

Today, I proposed a problem that we could add to the test. At this point, Jack had written 20/25-ish of the problems on the test because he kept scrapping others' problems. The leader (we'll call him Sam) thought it was a good problem, but Jack didn't. Later, Jack went on the problem document and quietly replaced my problem without telling anyone. Here's our summarized conversation:

Me: ""Jack, I kindly ask that you let us know before making changes to the document. Please stop deleting other people's work. This was my only problem on the test, and I'd like you to at least give a reason why you deleted it as I'd like to make a contribution to this project.""

Jack: ""Alright, I want all my problems back."" \[Deletes all his problems.\]

Jack: ""I'm gonna give my opinion on this. All you care about is getting your problem on the test and being able to say, 'I wrote that one'. I have 1.5 years experience writing problems for \[list of other competitions\]. Instead of pushing to put my bad problems on the test, I drop those problems and look for other ideas.""

Me: ""I think you're misunderstanding me here."" \[Restates claim from original message.\]

Jack: ""\[quoting me\] 'This was my only problem on the test.' Seems like you still want to have your problems on it.""

Me: ""I'm simply trying to tell you that you shouldn't remove people's problems without telling them. As of now, you *still* have not told me why you don't like this problem.""

Jack: ""It just doesn't have the right 'feel' for an AMC 8 problem.""

Me: ""One, that's not specific enough to override both my opinion and Sam's. Two, I restate: why didn't you tell us when you made changes?""

Jack: ""I didn't know I had to do that.""

Me: ""This is a basic aspect of working in a team. How would you feel if a group member completely replaced all your work in a project?""

Jack: ""Well, I pick good partners.""

Me: ""Don't change the subject.""

Jack: ""I don't know what you want me to say.""  
Me: ""Maybe an apology of some form. When you're working in a group you generally want to be updated on other people's contributions.""  
Jack: ""No, when I got access to the document I assumed I could change it freely. If you wanted to see what I did you should have checked the document history. What's the difference between reading a message and looking through the history?""

Me: ""The history document is too long to check repeatedly. All I asked for was a simple apology--you could've even asked us to check the history to see your edits from now on and this argument wouldn't have happened.""

Jack: ""You've made changes I don't approve of too. I go through every change you've made and approve it. You care so much about what other people do to this document. I'm not giving an apology. And you, you clearly don't think I know what I'm doing.""

(Sister): ""I am sorry!"" I look down on the ground to see his drawings he made ripped on the floor. By then my mom (42f) came upstairs. (Sister): ""I am sorry! I will go rip up my drawings to make him happy!"" My little brother begins to cry again because he does not want her to rip them. (Mom): ""Go downstairs, I will talk to her."" So me, slightly annoyed, heads downstairs. My sister comes down a little later. I was a little more annoyed, because like always, she goes unpunished. I talk to my mom about it but she says (Mom): ""She is sorry."" and leaves the conversation at that.

Story 2: (Tonight) Last night my family got home from a vacation, as a souvenir my little brother got 2 snow globes. I am just looking for something to watch when I hear it again, my little brother crying. My sister and him were watching a movie when for no reason she started clinking the snow globes together because she ""Liked the noise"". (No idea what she was doing with HIS snow globes, they are not even toys) Well who would have guessed, one of them breaks. By then I was upstairs. Again, both my siblings are crying, my sister saying it was ""An accident"" and she was ""Sorry"". I am angry and raise my voice a bit. Just like last time, my mom was up there. (Mom): ""She is sorry and it was an accident!"" I got pissed and asked why would she just let my sister go unpunished because wtf did she think was gonna happen! My dad (42m) yells down (Dad): ""Quit arguing with your mother!"" I angrily walk back downstairs where I am now. I do feel bad that I yelled because my sister does not like yelling, but at the same time she should not have destroyed my brother's things.

We got to their house, and picked them up to go to lunch, and walking around. When I came home, she was screaming at me because I stole the car, and there were 2 credit card charges. She kept asking who I bought lunch for, when I actually went back to order a dessert.  I wanted to shut her up so I lied, saying I paid for my cousin.

I(19) decided to live with a friend in an apartment that’s only a 20 minute walk from where we both work. My friend and others have been begging me to move out since I was 16. It’s a pretty uncommon thing to do here. I live in the south where the majority of people live with their parents until they get married. I never wanted to do that. In fact, I was planning on gettin an apartment over the summer, but finally caved because my friend was telling me to move in with her in January. 

I brought the idea up to my parents in October, and they started picking it apart and asking what I would do with all the extra expenses I would have to pay. 

I explained to them that living here was more expensive than living with my friend. 

They called me ungrateful and said that it’s a privilege for me to live with them and to get groceries and my phone bill paid for by them.

I then said that the rent ($700) is me basically paying for all those things myself but regardless I was very grateful for the life they’ve given me. I would not want to get kicked out for wanting to leave. I still want a decent relationship with my parents. I was simply punished for giving an attitude which I didn’t understand but it’s fine. 

My parents have now been making snide remarks about my friend and the place we’re planning on staying at (my friend is great and so is the place).

Although I love my parents, I feel like a prisoner here. I have since I was younger, and when I wasn’t paying rent. 

We have this system where one of us (out of four siblings) clean the entire house for a week and then it’s the next siblings week. If we miss something, we get another week, punished, and pay our parents 20 dollars. 

I work three jobs and have been cleaning the house for a month now because I miss something every time. I also pay for groceries sometimes when my parents don’t buy things for me (I have a very strict diet due to medical conditions).

I’m just really tired, but I don’t want to hurt my parents’ feelings.

My (30F) have a long relationship with my friend, we'll call Matt (36M). Matt and I have been friends for over 10 years. (We are not and have never been romantically involved. He's like a brother.) He has a long history of addiction and abusive behaviors, mainly verbal and emotional, but occasionally physical. When he's sober, we have a great relationship. When he's intoxicated, the relationship is strained. I'm in therapy and have done lots of work on boundary setting with him.

Recently, he called me in the middle of the night to announce that he was ""coming over"" after leaving his family's gathering/party. I was asleep. He called multiple times until I eventually woke up, and let him in my house. He was visibly intoxicated. He rambled on for about an hour before going to bed. 

The next day, I told him I had friends coming over that same evening for a pre-planned ""girls night"" get together that he's known about. I asked him if he would be okay leaving or if I should reschedule. (The friends coming over do not like Matt and how he's treated me over the years, so they've asked not to be around him.) At the time, he said it was fine.

He asked a bit later if he could stay ""in the spare bedroom"" while I hosted friends. When I struggled to answer, he said okay and that it would make me uncomfortable. 

As this continued, I was cleaning all over for my friends and getting things ready. He kept drinking and watching TV. He finished off my vodka and some other drinks. This was about 4 hrs or so up until he left. 

As he was leaving, he asked if I would put my phone on ringer (volume up) so he could call if he decided to go fight someone and needed my help. I said I'd prefer not to with my friends coming over. He got upset and walked out, slamming the door. 

I texted later, apologized to him. He then started yelling at me about how rude I was to ask him to leave, how I'm a bad friend, and how he's a great friend and the only reason we have issues in our friendship is because I'm ""not great.""

I (20F) am planning to move out of my family home soon and rent a place of my own with the money I get from my trust fund that my Grandfather made for me, he was the only relative I was close to and he wanted me to have some form of independence which is why he made this for me. My family is well off and I know i'm lucky to be from such a background but it is smothering and I feel trapped. My parents control my every move and every second of my life from what I wear, what I eat to who my friends are as it's more business arrangements to have me be friends with the children they do business with. 

I never even tried a McDonalds meal until I was 18 because they felt that was beneath us, best sneaky birthday gift to myself ever. The reason i'm planning to move out is because quite frankly I can't take it anymore but the idea terrifies me at the same time i'll be honest. I told them recently that I was looking for my own place and they freaked out and began to rant about how i'd be unable to rent a place that was good enough, how i'd make them seem poor if I rented and how it'd make them look less to their friends that they were just sending me off like that.

When they calmed down a little they agreed I should move out at my age but they want to buy me a home. Talking about the investment it could be and how it'll seem more tasteful and less ""poor"". I don't want this, it'll be another way they control me and I know that if they buy me a place i'll have no true freedom and things will likely only be worse. I told them I didn't want this and I wouldn't take a home from them which has ended up in a huge fight and they threw in my face how many people would love to have my life or parents who would do this for them and that I was being entitled to try and throw their goodwill back in their faces and how they didn't know what they'd done to deserve such a daughter.

That is lovely and I’m more than happy to get to meet this new side of the family.

 Here’s where things get complicated: I’ve been having a really rough time mentally and being on the spectrum amplifies that greatly. I’m busy, I’m tired, and I’m in no place to meet new people. Being autistic, I really need to be told of plans before they happen because I need to mentally prepare and to put it plainly to prevent a meltdown from the breaking of routine y’kno? My mom very kindly organized this trip so I could visit during this thanksgiving weekend and spend time with her and my stepdad. I loved that idea and was happy to visit family after being away for college for a bit. I wish I could’ve helped with the payment but my visa doesn’t allow me to work so I’m immensely grateful for my mom’s help. Of course, because of that, I’m absolutely willing to follow any plans she has. She’s the hostess and she’s paying for my flights so it’s only reasonable. All I ask is for her to tell me things in advance. 

Today, while I’m already here, I’m informed that not only are there visitors coming tomorrow, but they’re also people I’ve never met before. They have 2 kids around 4-5 and I was asked by my mom to entertain them and give them my plushies (which by the way are a special interest and Im very picky of who holds them because they truly are THAT special to me. I declined). I’m being asked to watch over them and entertain them and such. I am not in a state to do that. I have low energy from the influx of interaction with family, overstimulation from travel, and the additional drainage that is catching a monster cold that I am moments away from simply going non-verbal. Even if I wanted to, I can’t bring myself to talk. It hurts to do so too from my throat pain. But my mom is telling me that I just don’t want to because I don’t feel like helping. And I get it. She is running around making everything perfect when guests come over. She’s a sweet woman who just cares a lot. Im more than willing to help with table setup, dishes, cleaning, and just overall hospitality (even then I straight up don’t think that’s even sanitary given my cold but I can cover up head to toe if it means mom will be a little calmer). But I’m way too burnt out to focus specifically on caring for and entertaining young kids. I feel really bad for saying no though so I’m asking for a third-person perspective.

Story 1: One night I (14f) was watching some Youtube when I heard my little brother (7m) crying. I ran upstairs wondering what happened, once he calmed down he said (LB): ""Sister (10f) ripped my drawings I worked hard on."" My sister is in the same room crying aswell. (S): ""I am sorry!"" I look down on the ground to see his drawings he made ripped on the floor. By then my mom (42f) came upstairs. (S): ""I am sorry! I will go rip up my drawings to make him happy!"" My little brother begins to cry again because he does not want her to rip them. (M): ""Go downstairs, I will talk to her."" So me, slightly annoyed, heads downstairs. My sister comes down a little later. I was a little more annoyed, because like always, she goes unpunished. I talk to my mom about it but she says (M): ""She is sorry."" and leaves the conversation at that.

Story 2: (Tonight) Last night my family got home from a vacation, as a souvenir my little brother got 2 snow globes. I am just looking for something to watch when I hear it again, my little brother crying. My sister and him were watching a movie when for no reason she started clinking the snow globes together because she ""Liked the noise"". (No idea what she was doing with HIS snow globes, they are not even toys) Well who would have guessed, one of them breaks. By then I was upstairs. Again, both my siblings are crying, my sister saying it was ""An accident"" and she was ""Sorry"". I am angry and raise my voice a bit. Just like last time, my mom was up there. (M): ""She is sorry and it was an accident!"" I got pissed and asked why would she just let my sister go unpunished because wtf did she think was gonna happen! My dad (42m) yells down (D): ""Quit arguing with your mother!"" I angrily walk back downstairs where I am now.

Well yesterday my friend, we’ll call her Sofia, texted me yesterday late at night and said something along the lines of “you didn’t say happy thanksgiving to me” she didn’t say it either, which I told her. She eventually said happy belated thanksgiving. She then told me to say it back (lowkey kinda forced me, but that’s my opinion). I then just said it back but added a “😐”. She didn’t like that and asked why I sent the text like that. I told since I don’t celebrate thanksgiving, I didn’t really mean it. She also didn’t like that response. I then told her I would be honest to her rather than lie to her. 

She then text a friend, which we both know, and told them the whole situation. I guess Sofia texted her to back her up?? I’m not sure why she felt the need to text our friend about our conversation. Anyway, our friend, we’ll call them Alex, said that I should have wished Sofia a happy thanksgiving because it’s Sofia’s tradition. I got mad that Sofia text our friend about the situation, but I didn’t mention it. I then apologized to just stop the situation. I do feel bad because I did hurt her feelings. She kinda just brushed off my apology, which I kinda get. 

To add, even if I did celebrate thanksgiving, I most likely wouldn’t have wished Sofia a happy thanksgiving because I would’ve forgotten, also, the party was very crazy, I was catching up with cousins and I got a new dog which I had to take care of during the party.

She has a condo that I moved into at the end of October. It was kind of a last minute thing as I was getting out of an abusive roommate situation, so needless to say I was very grateful to her. 

At the time she had a kitten that she had found on the street a few weeks prior. He was small and cute and I really didn’t think anything of it. And like I said, I was really thankful for her letting me move in. 

But now that I’ve been living here a few weeks, the kitten is starting to cause some problems for me. He’s very hyper and energetic. Sometimes I hear him running around the apartment. If you’re in the common area, he’s always wanting to play. He tries to lie in my lap, and I have to push him off or put him down, which half the time doesn’t stop him. And he’s gotten big enough to get on the counters and table, which I find disgusting. My roommate doesn’t seem to mind, and just tells me to wipe/disinfect the counters and table before use like she does, but that seems like a ton of work. 

The biggest problem, however is that my girlfriend is allergic and hates cats in general, so she’s always annoyed when she’s over. There was some tension 2 weeks ago because the kitten jumped on her lap and she yelled at him to get the fuck off. My roommate came out and told her off, saying that “screaming like a banshee at an animal is counterproductive, and will only scare it” and that my gf had no right. My gf is now mad at my roommate for lecturing her. 

On to the current conflict, my roommate was at her boyfriend’s house for a few nights, and she took the kitten with her. When she came back, she didn’t have him. When I questioned her, she told me that she hurt her back and wouldn’t be able to play with him or scoop his litter. So she left him with her bf for a few nights. 

When she told me this I realized there was a perfect solution. I told my roommate that she should leave the kitten with her bf permanently so that my gf and I can be more comfortable. When she realized I was serious she told me that this was a temporary necessity and that her bf worked too much to take care of a “young kitten with high energy” which I found ridiculous because cats are fine being left alone. She also said that she doesn’t want to get rid of him because she bottle fed him and he was her baby. I got mad at that point because it’s just an animal and she was comparing it to a real baby. 

When I realized we weren’t getting anywhere I went to my room and we haven’t been talking much.

I went to a stag and doe last night and one of the prizes was 3 boxes of pokemon cards. This was clearly a popular prize as the bag was STUFFED with tickets. Well I won the prize and was thinking I would happily be opening pokemon cards enjoying my night hammered when I got home. So much so I messaged my father in jest him knowing how much I love nerdy things.

This is where the fun begins because within seconds I get a message from my mother saying ""Don't open those cards please"". I know why she wants to give them to my little cousin which is fine and dandy but honestly I spent some money on this stag and doe and wanted to enjoy opening the cards again like a kid and hey maybe I would pull some good money out of the packs (hint I did). I was very drunk at the time and responded back with something along the lines of ""I am opening them they are mine"" knowing exactly what she wanted to do with them. This led into me and my mother getting into a large argument after she told me to literally fuck off and that I was being selfish and childish because I didn't want to give the cards away as well as her guilt tripping me about how she ""bank rolled me"" for a long time (backstory to the reason for this is somewhat personal and I don't feel like explaining on reddit) which is always her go to with any fight of ours.

I don't want to rewrite this for a few reasons, but I will add that my MIL is genuinely angry with me, and my husband will not speak to me following her response.

Plus, I feel like a bad person for this, but I also feel like I should be in charge of who sees me in pain.

I just found out I'm pregnant. My husband (31M) and I (30F) are both extremely excited. We are not at the point where it makes sense to involve our families (like, objectively), as I also have had a miscarriage with another partner, which makes me extra cautious, and I want to make sure that we tell them only after we've insured the baby is coming.

The issue is that my husband fights fire in the PNW every summer, and it is very lucrative for him to do so. I wouldn't usually care (and I actively would prefer he didn't do fire), but, since he does, it makes sense for us to plan around it. (To be clear: I'm proud of my husband. It is just that 4 months out of the year, we either have to decide against money, his presence, or whatever his government agency views as the other side of outreach.) I do not judge my husband's decisions, and, even though it hurts, I completely understand why he does what he does and trust his decisions in doing so.

But I get extremely embarrassed about pain. Since I was a little girl, I literally have cried whenever anyone has yelled at me. I am not saying I have never been in the wrong, but I have a response to tone. I also get embarrassed absurdly easily, to the extent that I have apologized to my husband when I had a stomach bug, and he had to clean up my vomit on a truly gross occasion. (He didn't care about it, but I'm mortified to this day.)

Am I the asshole to only want my husband or mom with me when I give birth? I love my MIL, but I just can't be that vulnerable around her, and I feel like an AH for ignoring that she will be an amazing grandparent. My husband made a comment about involving his mom, and I totally agree. I just don't want her in the room if I'm alone. And he sort of deflected on the subject.

My MIL learned of the news and threw a fit at Thanksgiving when I told her that I wasn't pregnant (which was a lie I made to not raise hopes . . . we are literally at the threshold, and I'm being over cautious), but that I would tell her what I was comfortable with as it became relevant (because, again, finding out that you are pregnant and announcing are two different things).

There’s this running joke in the family that I always get my period whenever we’re on vacation. I really hate this joke and have repeatedly asked my parents and siblings to stop it but they say they won’t because it’s “true“. 

To their credit, it kinda is. But the reason I hate this joke is because the trauma my parents caused me when I was younger. Each summer, We always to an expensive 5-star-hotel near the sea side and my parents want us kids to enjoy it as much as possible and go swimming and exploring things etc … sounds thoughtful right ? 


Well, I had severe period cramps that make doing these activities impossible for me I just want to stay in the room and keep my self warm. This doesn’t sit well with my parents and they yell at me and berate me for hours and refuse to give me painkillers for my period or let me come down to the restaurant to eat as a punishment until “I learn how to track my period and not waste their money” (btw I had and still have an extremely irregular period) eventually I’m forced to do the “fun family activities” anyways I end up in a very bad state: passed out once, threw up few times. But no one really cares that for me this wasn’t a great vacation it was agony. 

Now as an adult they can’t force me to do anything I don’t feel like doing obviously and I pay for myself so it’s not like I’m wasting their money if I did get my period and ended up stuck in my room. But they still joke about it, which I hate. 

Last time they did this, I blew up at them and told them I’m done talking to them until they grow the fuck up and take a biology class.


 And I stuck to my word it’s been 3 months since we last talked and my sister thinks I’m an Asshole and should let bygones be bygones and laugh with them about it.

Brother is( M29) has mental issues , runs in the family. Whenever he doesn’t get his way he sends abusive texts or yells at the family.

He lied about making payments on his car and ruining my moms credit and never apologized for it.

A few years ago a person from our school who basically nobody knew before finesessed her way into the extended group by being nice and sympathetic.

A year passes and the mentioned person, let's call her F got much more comfortable, and cocky.

I love my closest friends. They are genuinely good people who desire niceties and people who act like good friends. But this is also a factor that has made them prone to manipulation. They are great people, but they possess weaknesses which people like F try to exploit. Among the group I am one of the few autistic cynics who like to face the worst in people. Unfortunately most of them prefer to avoid facing uncomfortable truths. But before this person, this hasn't really become an issue.

She was nice and lowkey for years. Making grand gestures or reaching out while being sympathetic. But this shit has turned bad in the last two years. I have been on to her manipulative nature since the first week of knowing her. But only she knows that, expressed in fake smiles and a game of ""Who can seem more nice to each other, so the other person who would openly speak out about what we both know would seem like the aggressor"". 

To spoil what she is about: She is a grifter. F is now cashing out on her investment on niceties with vulnerable people.

It all started with small things, which I try to sum up as short as possible:

1. She organized her own birthday party.  
It is a normal thing among my friends to crowdfund parties. Set X amount of money to send in for the attendents, then spend the supplies to buy stuff for the event.  
Usually 5-10 Bucks. This one was 25 for 20 people. Resulting in 500 bucks.  
Looking at the supplies, it obviously cost a bit less than our 100 bucks parties. She pocketed the rest. Alarming, but I knew few of the others were willing to face this reality. Because she really puts on a great ""I'm your friend, i've been so nice to you, why would you say something like that"" facade if fronted about it.  
After a bit of research, it turns out her birthday was two months later. I assume she just needed cash quick. She and her BF don't really earn much.  

2. ""My car broke down"". Asks the friends for cash, few give cash because ""Aight why us tho"". Amount is low. So she goes on a tantrum because people ""don't care for her"". A lot of them think that was weird, but ignore the long term picture.
3. &amp;#x200B;
4. Second birthday of F comes around. This time a month after the actual date. The gang crowdfunds a gift of about 200 Bucks. A gift which was group activity she has talked about for the past her, which she was extremely fond of. F gets all emotional on the Birthday, says she hates it. Can't explain why. Emotionally writes towards the Group Leader on how she would rather have the cash. Group leader gives in.

My fiancé and I were planning on attending and were really excited because this was going to be the first time he met my extended family members. I should also mention that fiancé lost his mother Nov. 1st to cancer and he has no other siblings.

I was borrowing my mom’s car for the trip and my sister was unsure on whether she'd ride with me or with our parents to the location.

The night before we leave, we get a call about fiancé's dad running into a tree 3 hours South from us. So, I call my mom to let her know about it and that we might not be able to go to Thanksgiving. She tells me that my sister is supposed to be riding with me now as they had already left. So, I ask my sister if she'd be ok with us taking a detour instead to check on his dad and talk to the doctors before driving the rest of the trip. He was in a medically induced coma at that point so there really wasn't much more than that he could do. She outright refused, because she hurt her back a couple weeks ago and adding 3 more hours to the road trip was ""out of the question.""

At first, my mom was ok with the plan (she even wired me $200 that I didn't ask for), but after I called my sister, my mom suddenly changed tunes. They wanted me to leave my fiancé in our home city to figure out how to get to his dad on his own and then spend the rest of the holiday alone. The other solution was for him to just come straight down to our Thanksgiving and forget seeing his dad. I had a problem with that because his dad’s injuries were pretty serious. His right lung had collapsed, his L1 and L2 had fractured, and his right elbow was shattered.

Then my sister started complaining that she couldn't do the drive by herself, so I asked her again to make this small compromise for the detour, and she once again refused. I have completely uprooted my life for my sister in ways that I don't want to mention, so the fact that she can't concede this one little request really stings.

So, we arrange a ride to take us to the hospital and I take my mom's car to my sister so she can drive herself because I wasn't about to abandon my fiancé in his time of need. Now they're saying that I ruined Thanksgiving for my dad especially because he wanted us all there together to say goodbye to his sister. And my sister is saying that I shouldn't be putting my fiancé above my family’s' needs.

I was more concerned about him being all alone for 3 or 4 days. And the detour was in the same general direction as the family trip, we would just go South for a bit before going East. He has no other family and considered this family get-together as an opening door for his new family now that he's about to lose the last of his.

She has another daughter named Andy (4f) that she and her wife Ella (38f) had together shortly after they got married.

I’m not very close with my mom. My bio dad wasn’t the best person, and I know that in her eyes, I was just a reminder of him. 
When I was 8, she sent me off to live with my grandmother, and really the only time I ever heard from her was when she’d send money for me every few months.

I spent a very large portion of my childhood wondering why she didn’t want me, or why she never seemed to even like me. I would always create reasons as to why, convincing myself that I must have done something wrong. Before Andy was born, and my mother and I had sort of started to speak more than we had previously, my therapist suggested that I just sit my mom down and talk to her directly. Instead of wondering what the answers were, I could just hear them from the source.

My mom told me that she sent me to live with my grandmother because she couldn’t stand being near me. Me being out of her sight made it easier for her to pretend I didn’t exist, which then made it easier for her to go on with her life and heal.
I don’t blame her for feeling that way, like I said my bio dad isn’t a good person, and I get why she couldn’t handle being my mom. I don’t necessarily forgive her because I was a kid and I deserved better but I also don’t hold her totally responsible because I know she was going through a lot.

I’m not sure how much her wife Ella knows about our history, but she has been very clearly trying to get my mom and I to reconnect.
I guess she wants me to know Andy. Maybe they both do, but I’m not sure.

My mom asked me to meet her for coffee to talk. While we were at the coffee place, she told me that she was sorry about how things played out between us, and that she hoped her apology was enough for me to forgive her. I said that it meant a lot to hear her say sorry, but that her saying it wasn’t enough for me to just forgive and forget it all. I understand her and I empathize with her, but I can’t forgive her.

After I left, she ended up texting me and telling me how unfair I was being to tell her that her “sorry” wasn’t enough. She said it took a lot for her to get to the point where she could own up to this, and me just saying it essentially meant nothing, really hurt her feelings.
In her last text she said that I didn’t have to outright say I can’t forgive her, especially since I do seem to want to have some sort of relationship with her, I could have just kept that info to myself.

Every year our friend group has a little Christmas get-together, like a little house party. We've decided last year to do a secret Santa, and I was paired with the friend. Lets call him Abraham from here on out (not real name). Abraham has always seemed weird around the decoration and such we have around the house during parties, but I thought nothing of it. 

It came around that time and me and my wife (63F) picked out a nice pair of hiking boots for Abraham. We know how much he likes to walk, and in the region its hard to get around without boots. When the day rolled around I presented him with my gift, but he looked upset and uncomfortable and said he didn't get me anything in return. He used the excuse that he's Jewish, but that shouldn't stop someone from having a good time on Christmas and participating in an event. We had a large verbal argument that ended up in him leaving the party, and since then we've been fairly distant from each other. Now that its holiday time again talks of another secret Santa have been brought up and Abraham has began saying that I should be excluded. He's been pushing it even farther too, and at this point I've been fired from my job because of the whole situation.

I will make this as short as possible. For context, I'm 22, diagnosed with PDD-NOS (a former diagnosis term for the autism spectrum) at age 8, and I'm still living with my mom because I can't drive, though I do hope to move out someday by myself or with my girlfriend (I'm a bisexual woman). As you'd think with most autistic adults, I have major issues with some clothing items, the main problem being bras. I have tried so many kinds, sizes, etc, and none of them would feel comfortable to me. Whenever I'd try them on, I would feel constricted and sometimes have a meltdown over them. 

I did try other alternatives, like tank tops, and those feel okay, but my mom always makes me wear regular bras. I would often get comments from her like, ""A bra would be more supportive than a tank top/camisole, so you should wear a bra."" Her making me wear one has triggered so many meltdowns from me, and she would only encourage my meltdowns by saying stuff like... 

""Suck it up""

""This is a part of being a woman""

""It's inappropriate to not wear one""

But the main one she would say is, ""It's my house, and if you don't like my rules, get out."" 

I have told her many times how uncomfortable I feel about bras, even talking to her as respectfully as I could, and it's now at that point I just feel like I need to give in to her rules. She doesn't listen and still orders me to wear them. To be honest, I'd do anything to make her happy. I'm fed up with the drama between us, so I feel like I would wear them only because she expects me to, even with my chest not being that big (I'm a B cup). But when I move out someday, I'll do things by myself since I would no longer be under her roof. 

It has driven me crazy, enough that I have yelled at her many times for being frustrated by the things she would say about me not wearing a bra. I know yelling may not be the best approach. It's easy for someone like me to feel overstimulated and yell when frustrated, although I can cut back if that's not the best option.

I(19) decided to live with a friend in an apartment that’s only a 20 minute walk from where we both work. My friend and others have been begging me to move out since I was 16. It’s a pretty uncommon thing to do here. I live in the south where the majority of people live with their parents until they get married. I never wanted to do that. In fact, I was planning on gettin an apartment over the summer, but finally caved because my friend was telling me to move in with her in January. 

I brought the idea up to my parents in October, and they started picking it apart and asking what I would do with all the extra expenses I would have to pay. 

I explained to them that living here was more expensive than living with my friend. 

They called me ungrateful and said that it’s a privilege for me to live with them and to get groceries and my phone bill paid for by them.

I then said that the rent ($700) is me basically paying for all those things myself but regardless I was very grateful for the life they’ve given me. I would not want to get kicked out for wanting to leave. I still want a decent relationship with my parents. I was simply punished for giving an attitude which I didn’t understand but it’s fine. 

My parents have now been making snide remarks about my friend and the place we’re planning on staying at (my friend is great and so is the place).

Although I love my parents, I feel like a prisoner here. I have since I was younger, and when I wasn’t paying rent. 

We have this system where one of us (out of four siblings) clean the entire house for a week and then it’s the next siblings week. If we miss something, we get another week, punished, and pay our parents 20 dollars. 

I work three jobs and have been cleaning the house for a month now because I miss something every time. I also pay for groceries sometimes when my parents don’t buy things for me (I have a very strict diet due to medical conditions).

I’m just really tired, but I don’t want to hurt my parents’ feelings.

I just found out I'm pregnant. My husband (31M) and I (30F) are both extremely excited. We are not at the point where it makes sense to involve our families, as I have had a miscarriage with another partner, and I want to make sure that we tell them only after we've insured the baby is coming. 

The issue is that my husband fights fire in the PNW every summer, and it is very lucrative for him to do so. I wouldn't usually care (and I actively would prefer he didn't do fire), but, since he does, it makes sense for us to plan around it. (To be clear: I'm proud of my husband. It is just that 4 months out of the year, we either have to decide against money, his presence, or whatever his government agency views as the other side of outreach.) I do not judge my husband's decisions, and, even though it hurts, I completely understand why he does what he does and trust his decisions in doing so.

But I get extremely embarrassed about pain. Since I was a little girl, I literally have cried whenever anyone has yelled at me. I am not saying I have never been in the wrong, but I have a response to tone. I also get embarrassed absurdly easily, to the extent that I have apologized to my husband when I had a stomach bug, and he had to clean up my vomit on a truly gross occasion. (He didn't care about it, but I'm mortified to this day.)

Am I the asshole to only want my husband or mom with me when I give birth? I love my MIL, but I just can't be that vulnerable around her, and I feel like an AH for ignoring that she will be an amazing grandparent. My husband made a comment about involving his mom, and I totally agree. I just don't want her in the room if I'm alone. And he sort of deflected on the subject.

My MIL learned of the news and threw a fit at Thanksgiving when I told her that I wasn't pregnant (which was a lie I made to not raise hopes . . . we are literally at the threshold, and I'm being over cautious), but that I would tell her what I was comfortable with as it became relevant (because, again, finding out that you are pregnant and announcing are two different things). Am I jerk for only feeling comfortable with my husband (STRONG preference) or my mom (in an emergency and in no other case) for the birth I hope to have? 

If I'm being a jerk, please tell me. This is so weird for me. I love my in laws, and I want them to know I love them, but this feels so...personal?

Anyway long story short, I have a friend whose Mom was mistreating her dog. Locking her in a room 24 hours a day for almost a year.  The dogs teeth were rotting and she had matted up fur like dreadlocks that I had to cut off with scissors. It's been bothering me for a long time and I in have repeatedly complained to my friend about it but she won't do anything to help the dog. 

The last straw came when I discovered the Mom was also feeding the dog poisonous foods (chocolate, onions, coffee), which are toxic to dogs and can kill them. Her last dog died mysteriously and I'm pretty sure that's why.

This is when I decided I need to take the dog. The reasons I did this instead of calling the police are several. I spoke to someone at the SPCA about it who said that unless I could prove the dog was being poisoned (which I couldn't), the police would not be able to do anything. My friend's Mom is a 60 year old ex crackhead who is disabled from being shot during a robbery 20 years ago and has a heart condition,  and has marijuana in the house. I thought the police would find it and arrest her, and I didn't think she'd survive even a night in jail. My friend herself also has pending DUI charges and having the police come to the house again (they've been several times last year due to domestic disputes between her and her ex) wouldn't look good at her upcoming court date.  

I tried to take the dog and tell them it ran away, but they didn't buy it and threatened to call the cops on ME.  I did end up having to bring the dog back and am devastated by the whole situation.

It’s not an incredibly labor-intensive job, but it does involve some moderate lifting and being on your feet all day. About a year ago, I was promoted to an office position, so since then I’ve just been sitting on my butt. I didn’t really have a diet or exercise routine prior to this, so I gained a lot of weight pretty quickly.

One co-worker in particular, who shares that office space with me, asked me directly if I was pregnant. She saw the rapid weight gain and made an unfortunate assumption. We had a miscommunication (because I was stunned at the question, so my fault) and she showered me with “congratulations!” until I cut in to say “I’m not pregnant… I’ve just gained a lot of weight.”

The whole thing was kind of upsetting for me, because I struggle with self-esteem and past bullying. The way that I usually deal with hurtful comments is to lean into it and own it. So, I’ve been trying to make a lot of jokes about it. “I can’t carry [inventory], because I’m shelving for 2 now,” or putting a jar of pickles on my desk.

Recently, I was making one of these jokes with some co-workers, who were laughing and joining in, when a manager (who has never liked me) told me “stop talking like that. It’s insensitive to pregnant people.” I explained the context (about the co-worker asking if I’m pregnant), and the manager looked at my stomach and said “I mean…” and sort of gestured in a way that suggests it was a reasonable assumption.

Since then, I’ve been really playing up the fake pregnancy thing - jokes, holding my stomach, etc. - even though I was told that it might be upsetting and insensitive.

We’ll call her Ava.

Ava and I used to be pretty friendly, but I’ve distanced myself the last couple of years because of a series of instances where she has behaved childishly and petty toward me. I don’t want to foster a friendship with someone whose company I don’t particularly enjoy. That said, It’s important to me to keep the peace at work and not make more waves than necessary.

I am determined to be a good Secret Santa, and have purchased a gift for each member of Ava’s family (all animals) that I plan to gift separately over the coming weeks. 

Last week, I left the first present in her cubicle, which was a thoughtful gift for one of her pets. I have experience with this particular type of animal (not a normal house pet) and put thought into this gift, and really thought it would be appreciated. I would buy it for my own animal. She posted a picture and a thank you to our internal group chat, and I didn’t think any more of it. 

Today, Ava approached me and asked if I had received a Secret Santa gift and I told her I had and was gracious about it. She used this as an opening to start bashing the gift she had received from her Secret Santa (me). She felt comfortable doing this, despite the fact that we are a small department and there was only a few people it could be, because I “would know better than to get her something like this.” Ava criticized the plastic packaging the gift came in, insinuated that it was old/expired, even though this item doesn’t actually expire, and had texted a mutual friend of ours to make fun of it/ turn it into an inside joke. Again, this a grown woman acting like a Mean Girl.  

I went along with it, and at no point did I reveal I’m her Secret Santa. I did politely question a few of the points she was trying to make because her logic was weak, at best. 

I still plan to give her the remaining gifts and assume at some point that she will put 2+2 together and realize I’m her Secret Santa. I’m planning on wrapping her remaining gifts in the same paper I am giving a small gift to the rest of the office in. We don’t have a time where we get together and reveal it- it’s up to the gift giver to decide if they want to reveal themselves. I think the wrapping paper will give it away if she doesn’t figure it out first, and honestly I’m fine with that. Looking forward to it, even. 

I’m feeling a little hurt, but mostly just amused and a little spiteful. I am also anticipating her to find fault with the other gifts for petty reasons (dog toy won’t be “one she likes” or cat treat won’t “be organic enough”). Another friend outside of work said Ava will be extremely embarrassed when the lightbulb goes on.

 I 24(f) have a family tradition where all the kids and grandkids of my grandparents will receive birthday presents by the family until they turn 26. 

Last year was my 23rd birthday I threw a party and (as expected) everyone brought me gifts, except my autistic cousin 22(m). I was disappointed but didn't bring it up because what I got from others was amazing and I was grateful for what I had.

For my 24th birthday (Sept 1) it was repeated, he didn't get me a gift, this time I brought it up in a not super pushy way. His response was ""You should be grateful I'm even here, you fat ugly wh0re"" I assume he said this because my then fiance now husband came from a wealthy family and he showers me in gifts/love (I love him sm, and I'm very grateful). I brushed it off and kept enjoying my birthday.

Last week was his 22nd birthday and I had recently got a promotion and since I had spare money, I splurged on his gift. By then I had moved past most of what he said. He loves all things dinosaur and wants to be an archeologist, I spent around 200$ on the skull of a fox sized dinosaur skull from a certified skeleton store. On the bottom was a little authentication sign and an info card.

When his birthday came around we all gathered and we all had a great time until it got to gift opening, when it was my gift he picked up, he had a mild look of disgust but opened it regardless, when he saw the gift he said ""See this is probably a fake plastic replica, her broke ass couldn't afford a real skull, and if her husbands rich why didn't he buy it"" and he tossed it onto the couch. I picked it up showed him the label and loudly read about what it was and where it was from, then I showed him it was read by gifting it back to him so he could feel the bone. After that he giggled and said ""oops"" ALL HE SAID WAS OOPS!! 

Immediately I snatched the gift and me and my fiance left. From then my aunt and uncle and most of the family kept messaging me saying how he doesn't think before he speaks and to give it back and he's so sad and because he didn't understand why he didn't get the gift (I'm assuming they said this because he's neurodivergent, but I don't think that's fair)

Pretty excited to here details.  Next day another friend puts out a msg in our group chat inviting to celebrate 2 friends for 2023 milestone bdays on said trip.  Trip is planned for early spring.  I too have a milestone bday in 2023.  One of the planners and I just days before had discussed the fact that I would be turning X0 in 2023.  I was deeply hurt that she did not think to include my birthday in the 2023 birthdays to be celebrated on girl's trip.  If her and I had not just talked about it I probably would have responded with a jokey thing about it being my milestone birthday too.  

I didn't respond to group message about the trip and was kind of trying to avoid them as I didn't want to have to sit there and pretend I was okay when I wasn't.  The friend who knew 100% I was celebrating a milestone in 2023 asks me what's up so I tell her.

She doesn't understand why am I upset.  She keeps saying it wasn't done on purpose and because my birthday is later in the year she didn't think it was the same.  I guess she has some weird calendar where 2023 is a leap year and second half doesn't count.  So then I asked her does that mean in the fall we will be doing another trip?  No response.  She keeps telling me she's so busy and her brain is fried, etc., etc.  But in one of the conversations where the plans were being made I feel she should have cared enough to remember my birthday too.  

So now she went crying to another friend about how she's so upset because she would never hurt anyone and she can't understand why I'm mad.  I think she left out the part about talking to me specifically about my birthday.  So now I look like some supersensitive whiner and they are mad at me.

I(40M) was in line at the Costco Gas.  For those of you not familiar with it, there are three lanes for each ""aisle"". A left lane with two pumps, a right lane with two pumps, and a middle ""passthrough lane"".  I was in the right lane and as I pulled up the two vehicles in front of me each pulled up to their respective pump.  The 2nd vehicle was a truck driven by an older man with a handicap license place and was directly in front of me.  He was slower than the first car two spots in front.  His gas tank was on the left hand side of his truck and he slowly got out and stood in the passthrough lane as he filled up his truck preventing anyone from using the passthrough lane.  The first car finished first and the older man spent an extra minute standing there slowly filling trying to get to $40 exactly. 

Once he finally finished, he walked to the right side of his truck to put the gas nozzle back.  While I could have waited for him to get in his truck and drive through, I instead drove through the passthrough line and backed into the  space in front of him (my gas fill up is on the right).  I was inside the dotted lines though truthfully closer than I wanted to be to the center and the front of my car was slightly angled towards the center.  He could get by but it would be a little difficult and he would need to be careful.

He quickly got mad and started gesturing at me.  I asked him nicely what was wrong and he angrily told me that I blocked him from getting out and should have waited.  I told him there was a passthrough lane for a reason and I was inside the dotted lines.  He then asked if I wanted the side of my car scratched.  At this point I got annoyed and in a passive aggressively nice voice asked him if he wanted me to give him more room.  He said yes and I responded I would move it and Merry Christmas at which point he responded with a snarl.  I flipped him off as I went back to my car (though I don't know if he saw it).  

I moved my car another couple of inches even though he could get by before.  He then backed way up and slowly went by me glaring at me while I smiled and waved at him in a sarcastic manner.  He was an older white guy that had a crappy truck and a handicap license plate so I am guessing life wasn't great already.  A couple of people that witnessed it then came up and said it wasn't worth it and that I was in the right and the guy was an idiot.

Knowing about her circumstances though, I offered to bring her to him. I used to live in Queens, right around the town where Frank lives, and I still have many family members living there. This means I make frequent visits there. So together, we came up with the idea that I could have my 15th birthday party in NY as an excuse for her to see him. I was on board with this until I spoke to him for the first time later on.

Earlier this month, I interacted with Frank for the first time. Sadly, this interaction didn’t leave the best impression of him on me. Hhe made remarks about me being in a mental asylum (because I was in therapy), tried to make it look like Rory was talking shit about me (sent me a fake screenshot), and insulted my boyfriend and I's appearences in a group chat. This had me pissed, obviously.

I will say, the fighting WAS partially my fault, since I found old pictures of him and sent them to him (and some were edited with funny filters and stickers, but nothing was inappropriate or intentionally mean) through Instagram. I believed nothing negative would come out of sending them, since Rory approved of it and she knows him better than I do. Eventually, we made up, but I still didn’t like him since he started treating her like shit.

Obviously, after everything that went on between me and Frank, my mind changed about having my birthday party in NY. I didn’t want to host my birthday party in a different state for someone I didn’t like. To me, it seems like a waste of my parents money and a waste of my time. But still, Rory is persistent that I do, despite me repeating that he’s not a good person and that I don’t like him. 

I’m stuck on what to do, since we had already decided to make plans, and I don’t want to let my friend down. If I were to disregard our original plans, she would be rightfully upset. This was probably something she's been looking forward to. 

I wouldn’t be losing anything if I decided to cancel because I haven’t made any permanent plans, but I would be losing the ability to have fun if I didn't. I feel horrible about cancelling plans, but I feel that it's my birthday and that I have the right to celebrate it the way that I want to.

I share to them that im taking a quick vacation with my GF before hell week starts. But then they start hyping up the idea of doing a group trip.

I'm not usually open about doing spontaneous outings outside my closer circle. But I packed my introverted side and said why the heck not.

TLDR, we end up making a GC to start planning it and scout some accommodations. A week goes by, and we end up with 4 people for the trip. it would have been me, my GF, 1M, 1F. I took the initiative to get all the accommodations and budgeting done. Making sure that i mention that I'm doing the pre booking stuff already.

Then we get a huge blow to our plans when our (M) friend said that he over booked and had to cancel on us. So, we go back to the drawing board and try to figure out who can we take as a +1 for my 1F coworker as we need to have somebody to split the other room with her. I made all the effort of looking for her +1. Ask every person I know, even tried to drag my HS friend.

We even entertained the idea of her third wheeling with me and my GF, we discussed that we could just share a room instead. (we were on a tight budget since its peak season) Everyone was onboard with the plan even my 1F coworker said that she's used to third wheeling and was down to share a room as long as she gets to go to a beach.

Now as we got closer to the trip (around 2 weeks before) 1F all the sudden starts acting like she's going to flake out on us. And not like she is saying up front that she doesn't want to go. Like constantly having the trip on the hook like ""I'm waiting on the pricing of these concert tickets"" etc. I don't get why can't she just be up front if she wants to cancel on us because I would have not worried about booking other people but me and my GF instead.

Then our team decided to plan a quick dinner and 1F was part of the planning she mentioned that some of the team wanted to do the dinner at the time that we were going to leave. I told her that aren't we going to the beach during that time?

TLDR, she ended up still going ahead with planning it on the same day as the trip and I messaged her ""So i guess im not counting on you on the trip then"" and mentioned how disappointed i am, then she proceeds to say ""sorry"" to me. You know the way when someone flakes on you...

So, my plan now is still go with my GF since I really wanted to do a vacation before xmas season officially starts and skip our team dinner all together. I also confronted 1F about what happened, and I plan to keep my officemates at arm's length from now on.

We’ll call her Ava.

Ava and I used to be pretty friendly, but I’ve distanced myself the last couple of years because of a series of instances where she has behaved childishly and petty toward me. I don’t want to foster a friendship with someone whose company I don’t particularly enjoy. That said, It’s important to me to keep the peace at work and not make more waves than necessary.

I am determined to be a good Secret Santa, and have purchased a gift for each member of Ava’s family (all animals) that I plan to gift separately over the coming weeks. 

Last week, I left the first present in her cubicle, which was a thoughtful gift for one of her pets. I have experience with this particular type of animal (not a normal house pet) and put thought into this gift, and really thought it would be appreciated. I would buy it for my own animal. She posted a picture and a thank you to our internal group chat, and I didn’t think any more of it. 

Today, Ava approached me and asked if I had received a Secret Santa gift and I told her I had and was gracious about it. She used this as an opening to start bashing the gift she had received from her Secret Santa (me). She felt comfortable doing this, despite the fact that we are a small department and there was only a few people it could be, because I “would know better than to get her something like this.” Ava criticized the plastic packaging the gift came in, insinuated that it was old/expired, even though this item doesn’t actually expire, and had texted a mutual friend of ours to make fun of it/ turn it into an inside joke. Again, this a grown woman acting like a Mean Girl.  

I went along with it, and at no point did I reveal I’m her Secret Santa. I did politely question a few of the points she was trying to make because her logic was weak, at best. 

I still plan to give her the remaining gifts and assume at some point that she will put 2+2 together and realize I’m her Secret Santa. I’m planning on wrapping her remaining gifts in the same paper I am giving a small gift to the rest of the office in. We don’t have a time where we get together and reveal it- it’s up to the gift giver to decide if they want to reveal themselves. I think the wrapping paper will give it away if she doesn’t figure it out first, and honestly I’m fine with that. Looking forward to it, even. 

I’m feeling a little hurt, but mostly just amused and a little spiteful. I am also anticipating her to find fault with the other gifts for petty reasons (dog toy won’t be “one she likes” or cat treat won’t “be organic enough”). Another friend outside of work said Ava will be extremely embarrassed when the lightbulb goes on.

AITA for not revealing myself immediately and WIBTA to let her continue digging herself deeper if she chooses?

We grew up destitute, with my mother working multiple jobs and my dad in deep depression. My brother and bonded with my dad more. I have autism, and it affects my everyday life very harshly, even more so when I was younger. I was always raised independent, and from the age of around 5 I knew how to make myself food, maintain hygiene, the works.

When we lived at my grandparents' house, I had a lot of freedom. Then, he found a new girlfriend. She was fine at first, though I didn't really like her. I just assumed I was being strange and unreasonable, like usual. My brother and I were made to go to her house even though it was clear we didn't want to, and I always felt uncomfortable in there. I stayed in my ""room"" the entire time, and I lost weight because I wouldn't go upstairs even to get food.

There are a lot of rules, ones that I was never notified of until they were broken. These include:

Leaving bedroom door open at all times, no naps, always be in the room when there are visitors, always talk to visitors, not allowed out of bedroom after midnight no matter what, don't move camera in the garage, clean room after every day, no phone during a movie, no criticizing the dogs (the cat is fine), no running away when the dog is chasing/humping/biting you, etc.

Keep in mind once again, that I have autism and do not like change. I have never had any of these rules, and now I am being treated like I broke them on purpose. My dad is trying to convince me that all families have these rules, and I have no reason to be scared there. I *can* recall nice memories, and that muddles my view. We had some fun before, like going shopping and out to eat, and I don't know what to think.

They buy me stuff for my birthday and don't yell at me, they don't hurt me or bar me from seeing my mom. They let us have food, and they buy me my favorite soda when I ask for it. They're so nice, and I feel like an asshole every time I think that the rules are unreasonable and shame myself for thinking that.

After the newest fight they had (my father is an alcoholic though recently stopped for me and started smoking instead and his girlfriend is a borderline alcoholic), my brother and I talked, and concluded there's nothing we can do. She explodes at minor inconveniences and treats the dogs better than us. I know my dad loves us, but I can't keep doing this. Whenever I go there, it's too much. Every time I come back, I'm drained. I want to be able to handle it, I really do. I want to see my dad just like old times. But I can't. I know that if I can't handle it.

I don't know exactly what goes on but according to my brother it's the classic case of parents being really nice to everyone on the outside but being awful behind closed doors, and this was a bit surprising to me as my parents have been friends with his parents for many years.

Eventually my brothers friend got sent away to a boarding school many states away because his parents said he ""can't handle school"" (quote from my mom) which seems to actually be because he is struggling with his mental health and home life so they just wanted to send him away (based on anecdotes from my brother). According to my mom he's much happier away from his parents, which to me is very telling. Since then we haven't seen much of him, and though he has returned to school for a bit for weeks at a time, my brother has told him not to come by as much. I'm assuming he wasn't able to handle always having his very distressed friend over and decided to set a boundary which is fair. 

I can't remember the last time he showed up but it's been a while, and today he did, I could hear him crying from our living room. My brother turned him away as it was kinda late, which upset me a bit but that's his choice, but what my mom decided to do is what got me mad. Her first instinct was to text his mom, and while I understand the mentality behind it she does know that his parents are not the same with them as they are in private, she even admits to this.

I told her it was a bad idea and she shouldn't but she did anyways and I'm honestly really worried for the kid more than anything. I told her if she really wanted to help she should let him in or call a social worker but then both my parents started to yell at me and tell me ""you're not a parent you wouldn't know"" and that ""you don't know the whole situation and neither do we"". However their second point really contributes to what I was saying, and I just think it's not smart to essentially force him back into a potentially unsafe environment. 

I kept arguing and telling them that I've had friends in similar situations, and that the last thing that would be good for someone in a troubled or abusive household is to return to it. I know that's anecdotal but it still really isn't smart especially given all the prior knowledge we have. My parents got even more mad, and basically just kept telling me that it's up to his parents to make the decision of what to do which I think is really dangerous.

So AITA? I'm really more worried about this kids safety than being right. If I'm wrong and my parents made the right decision please tell me. I'll also add that I would not be able to call a social worker or provide anything for him myself as my parents would definitely not allow me to do so.

I think they asked me to wash dishes which I thought was sort of weird because the way that I grew up the guest was not supposed to do chores. But I guess it was expected of me to do the dishes, so i did like 80% of them but then i got sort of tired and i stopped. I asked my gf if it was ok that i didn't finish them and she said it was fine, until today when she told me her parents were pissed that I didn't finish all the dishes. 

Also they said something about putting up christmas lights. I don't remember this but apparently I said I wouldn't do it and they also got pissed for that. 

Lastly, I was supposed to be at my gf's place at 11am today but I overslept because we were out late last night and I woke up at 2pm. So I was super late, but she knows I have sleep issues and jokes about me being a sloth.... 

I know I should've texted her last night and said I would probably not be able to make it by 11. I guess I didn't think I was gonna sleep that late but....yeah. I fucked up. 

So....AITA for any of these things or potentially all three? I want to know so I can improve. I really like my girlfriend and I don't want to fuck up our relationship.

He didn't read or respond to my message until an hour later and just replied back with 'oh no baby'.  I confronted him later about it and he said that he didn't realize that I was sick even though I literally said 'I'm feeling sick'.  He didn't offer to help me, just ask if I want to go to the doctor.  Every time I get sick (which is rarely since I try really hard to take care of my health) he gets sick a few days later and makes the biggest fuss about it.  Dramatic, limping around, hyperventilating.  I offered to make him soup (which is what I wish he could have done for me), he eats it and complains that he just wants vegetable soup instead next time.  I told him to go get some rest and later went in to tell him I was feeling so resentful that he couldn't offer me any kindness while I was sick only to be met with 'I didn't realize you were sick'.  Still has enough energy to be tweeting at his friends though.

He takes care of me financially and promised to marry me at the end of next year (since I told him I won't date a man for years if it doesn't end in a proposal).   But I'm starting to see how selfish and childish he is.  I'm afraid he's going to treat the next girl way better than me but I am already preparing myself to leave.
