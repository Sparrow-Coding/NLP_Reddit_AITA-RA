So last week at 10pm. He came out of his room after studying for hours then got into the shower. I already had female moaning sounds on my phone ready to play. I waited til I started hearing him approach my room then played the sound at full volume. I watched the door and it looked like he was just standing outside then turning and walking away. I turned the sound off and went back to whatever I was doing that required privacy.


The next morning while we were having breakfast at 8 am. He asked why my girlfriend didn't join us. I said she wasn't here. He asked if she left early but I said she never came in the first place. He was confused he swore he heard female moaning sounds coming out of the room, I denied it but he freaked out saying I must've brought another woman home and was cheating on my girlfriend.

She had a boyfriend called N who is also the father to their three daughters. Well recently some things went down which caused my mum and S to stop talking. 

Things were okay for about a week. Suddenly, after being out one night my mum brings N home with her. To say I was shocked and confused is an understatement, why was the man I saw as an uncle doing here with my mum late at night? 

As you can probably guess he and my mum have now started dating. I told my mum how I felt about this but I got brushed off and told I was being stupid. However, things went downhill a bit, I started to notice that my mum and my sister would not be home that often. 

They would go out to dinner with N and his youngest daughter, without even thinking of inviting me. I wasn't sure if this was because I didn't like the idea of N and my mum dating. However, wouldn't this be a great chance for me to get to know him a little better and spend more time with him? 

I would end up with my calls ignored when my mum was with him and I would phone my aunt let's call her L and ask if she knew where my mum was. L would have me calling her sobbing because my mum was ignoring me and not involving me. I tried to tell my mum that it was hurting that I was being left out but I got told I was rude whenever I saw N. 

I will admit I was cold towards him and didn't have full conversations but I was trying to adapt to the fact that him and my mum were dating and I wasn't 100% used to it yet. However, I was never ever rude, I would say hello and talk to him a small amount. But I never intended to be rude. 

So AITA?

I'm gonna turn 20 in a few days and planned a party that is a few days later, no problem with this. 
So one of my friends, gonna call her chrissy. Chrissy turned 19 this year we knew each other since 6 or 7 grade, we often fought because of petty reasons one of them would be her jealousy when I hung out with people from my new school or that I didn't make time for her and would always learn. She decided to not go to college and I really couldn't care less. I live near my school and so does she. 

In the beginning of 2022 we weren't best friends but we were still in contact, one day she just decided for herself that she could judge me that I had other friends just because she didn't met new people, I visited her and wanted to talk but she refused so I decided enough is enough. We weren't in contact for 2 months before she texted me and was like, ' sorry was a stupid thing do to' that happend like 2 or 3 times again after that. 

In summer she was on vacation and we were on good terms in that time, we spend a lot of time and she even gave me some presents when she came back. Chrissy planned her birthday with my help and I helped her 3 days before her bday with buying groceries and cleaning her house etc. So her birthday came and I promised her I would be earlier to help her with decorating. She hurt her foot and could do anything so I cooked and decorated so she could get ready she was pretty grateful.


So on to my problem, a third girl is involved I'm gonna call her Melanie, Melanie and chrissy know eachother since 1 grade and I had no problem with her, her and chrissy weren't in contact on her birthday because they fought. Few weeks after they were okay again.

The thing is that Melanie's birthday is one day after mine, chrissy promised me to go to my birthday I was like okay, Melanie is gonna turn 19 and is gonna rent a few things.

 So chrissy calls me and tells me she won't come after she promised me for months. I planned her in my birthday plans. I was so pissed of because I spend money on her and just because she gets some attention from her other friend now she is jumping up and down and into her arms. I just said okay but you can't come now, and when Melanie decides to not talk to you don't come to my birthday because you aren't invited anymore and then I ended the call.

My bestfriends told me that she told them a whole diffrent story that she wasn't invited from the beginning and she wanted to come so bad, then I found out that Melanie uninvited her. I laughed so much, and I told them that she knew from the beginning that she wouldn't be welcome anymore of she suddenly decided to come.

And I'm so pissed because I did so much for her birthday and she did nothing in return, I know in a friendship you shouldn't expect anything and all but this is such a asshole move from her.

It was a normal aspect of life to save as much money as possible; but when I had to spend money, to extract as much value as possible. Despite being in a much better position today those behaviours never went away.

Yesterday my university friends \[30-36 M &amp; F\] and I \[30M\] caught up over dinner at a restaurant called HaiDiLao. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, it's basically an exorbitantly overpriced hot pot restaurant, that justifies its pricing by offering an assortment of complimentary gifts that you can take at your pleasure. For context, there were 8 of us, and together we spent $509.71; a not insignificant sum. So, yes, I was going to get as much of the complimentary offerings as possible. I loaded up on a small bag worth of the snacks, got a dozen hair ties, and even negotiated with the waitress to give us three of the take-home soup base packages (normally you're only given one). Did I need any of it? No. To be honest, most of the reason why I did it was just to be good fun.

And it was good fun. Almost everyone there had a good laugh from my antics. Even the restaurant's staff members. Well, everyone except one person: Reginald \[32M\]. If I'm going to be honest I've never liked Reginald. I've always thought he walked around with a 2 metre pole stuck up his ass. Specifically, he liked to always act as if he is some high society twat despite the fact of everyone at dinner he might just make the least. As we were leaving the restaurant Reginald commented, ""That was so embarrassing. I'm never eating out with you again."". Something about his tone just made his comment stood out from the banter. So I asked him to explain what he meant by the comment.

Reginald basically went on to say that how I acted was of someone that is beneath him, and that in other circumstances he wouldn't interact with people like me. At this point other members of the group started chiming in with reactions ranging from ""What is wrong with you, Reginald?"" and ""I think JDP-Phoenix is just trying to be funny"". If Reginald would have backed down and apologised, I would have let things go. But he stood his ground and said, ""I'm just being honest. JDP-Phoenix acted low class and I don't want to be associated with that behaviour."". Here's where I may be the asshole. I know full well that Reginald is extremely insecure about how much he makes. He's expressed that to the group a few times when he gets overboard with his drinking. Despite being cognisant of that, I fired back with ""Firstly, everyone else enjoyed my jokes. Even if the staff. So what's the problem? Secondly, I literally make multiples of you, mate. So calm it with the elitism."".

Before things got more heated my partner pulled me away and we went home. Earlier today I was told by my friends that my comment really hurt Reginald, and he spent Saturday night drinking himself into a stupor.

I’ve met about 90% of the group in person at least once, but since it’s an open group there are bound to be people I haven’t seen before. Everyone is generally very pleasant, and it’s a great way to find events. 

Most of the group went to a concert together last night, which left behind a couple of stragglers who had appointments, or like me, are mildly claustrophobic and hate big crowds. My evening was free, so I organized a small group dinner. I extended an invitation in the group chat to anyone who might be interested, specifying that I would be paying for everyone. A friend of a friend of a friend, who we’ll call “Nicole”, expressed immediate interest. I’ve never met her in person, but she texts a fair amount and seemed like a lively personality, so I was happy to get to know her a bit better. My very close friend Sachi also joined us, but I was prepared for a bigger group than just the three of us.

The problem started after we got seated at the restaurant and started to order. I had a sizable budget since I was prepared for more people. So money was not exactly at the front of my mind, I knew how much Sachi and I ate and that we couldn’t possible go over with one extra person. I get myself an appetizer and a main course. Fifty five dollars. Sachi orders herself a main course, and asks to steal some of my appetizer. Fine, another thirty. Then comes Nicole. She picks out the most expensive possible appetizers, main course, and desserts, proceeds to add every single paid modification possible, alongside a couple of drinks. Half way through the order I tell her to relax and that we could get more later, but she insisted that she wanted everything. I then told her that if she kept going I wouldn’t pay for it, but she literally laughed at me and told me I said I’d pay, so she was going to order what she liked. Her personal total came up above a hundred and fifty dollars. 

To me, this was in bad faith and I wasn’t having it. She was taking advantage of the fact that I was treating her, and using it to eat and stock her fridge for a few days with the leftovers. Obviously, when it came time for the bill, Nicole did not take well to the fact that I covered Sachi and not her. She told me that she wasn’t leaving until I paid her bill. I was not willing to compromise because it seemed clear to me that I was being abused. We waited for over an hour as she threw a fit and attempted to guilt me into paying.

Eventually her boyfriend texted me looking for her, so I explained the situation. He got pissed and told me to just pay and take her home, but I was adamant, so I gave him the address of the restaurant, made sure he was coming, and left her there.

Some quick background, my wife and I have been married for a few years. I work at home, and I happily asked her to quit her job and be a housewife/future stay-at-home mom. I make enough money to take care of both of us and we both wanted her to quit work when she was able to.

Fast forward to today, my workload has slowly built up to double what it used to be. I won't pretend like I work 16 hours per day, but it's more than it used to be -- and we still split household chores evenly.

Any time I ask my wife to cover one of ""my"" chores when I'm busy causes her to give me an attitude.

She cooks every day and folds clothes when I do laundry. That's about it.

I do laundry, wash dishes, clean up the kitchen every time she cooks, take trash out, clean the bathroom...basically everything else.

I told her I don't think it's too much to ask for her to take initiative and keep the house clean while I'm working, since, you know, she is a housewife. Which she chose to be.

She said she takes care of the same responsibilities that she's taken care of since we got married, which is true.

I said that she needs to realize the situation is different and she needs to decide if she really wants to be a housewife or not.

Huge fight, haven't talked to each other all day.

I appreciate her cooking and everything, but something seems off to me when I'm sometimes doing MORE housework than her AND working.

I, 22 y/o , am in college. I live in an a rental apt w/ my roommate , Simon, 28 y/o , &amp; his 4 y/o son. The mother of the child is deceased and he got together with his now ex gf but broke up 4 months ago. He was expecting a baby w/ her and the baby was born this past wednesday.


I was in the middle of studying and preparing for my exam when Simon barged in telling me his ex gf's mom just called him and said she was in labor and he had to go to the hospital. He started begging me to take his son for few hrs (prbly til midnight) so he could be there for his baby's birth. I declined and said I had so little time left and needed to focus on studying. He begged saying that I wouldn't even feel his son's presence but the kids so hyper active and hard to deal with basically. He started raising his voice at me saying I was being mean for no reason and he had no one else he knows that could take his son , I told him he could of prepared for this by hiring a babysitter. He started going off saying that I was being unhelpful on purpose. I told him to get out of my room. He said he'd just leave the kid with me then. I told him I'd call the cops as soon he do that which made him back off. He was fuming , he took his son and left and came back the next day telling me that I just caused him to miss the birth of his baby and that he'll never forgive me for what I'd done.

Prior to him moving in with me, he had never moved out of his parent's house. He is EXTREMELY close with his family. He texts or calls his parents 24/7. It is nonstop. As I said, they're very close. We go up to their house or they come to ours every single weekend and sometimes during the week.

My boyfriend and I have a great relationship and almost neverrrr get into arguments. Except for when we do...and it's usually over the same topic. His family (mainly his mother). We both work long shifts, 5 days a week. I feel as if the weekends are the only time we get to spend time together. During the week we normally make plans for the weekend. It never fails, as soon as I start getting ready for our planned outing, he'll say, ""I'm going to invite mom and dad up""... and they usually stay over 10 hours and we never get to do the things we planned.

This past weekend, I put up our Christmas trees while his parents were visiting. This year, we decided to do a Victorian tree in our dining room and a traditional tree in the living room with all of our sentimental ornaments from our childhood etc. She looked at my tree in the dining room and then looked back at me and said, ""You have to let him put candy canes on that tree! He has done that since he was a kid! It is a family tradition!"". I then had to explain to her (for 3rd time) that we would not be doing that to the tree in the dining room.

Every Christmas and New Year's Eve he has to go to his parent's house and stay the night because it is their family tradition. Our first year together, I didn't even know about the tradition. Last year, I played along and stayed because I was too nice to say no. However, I will not be staying this year and know it will be a fight with his mother.

The guy was arrested for out of state warrants so I didn't technically get him arrested but the cops showed up because of me. 
So this didn't happen recently but it's been bugging me. One afternoon, my wife pointed out there was someone who stopped in the middle of the street taking pictures of our house. We had 2 toddlers and a teenage boy. There was a lady and her teenage daughter living with us as well.
 My house sits about 30 yards from the road. There is about a 10 foot immediate drop then it slops to my house slightly. So from the road you can see into my house. To make matters worse, we have a big picture type window that is about 8 feet by 4 feet in my living room. 
Back to the photographer, my wife was freaking out trying to call the cops so I grabbed my keys and walked out the door. The guy turned around and drove back by, which was perfect because now I was much closer. I caught up with the guy while on the phone with my wife. The woman living with me was on the phone with the police and I was giving them information about where we were.
 The guy pulled into a neighborhood and parked at a house that was for sale.I pull up and get out thinking this is some pervert who was trying to get pictures of my family or something. So I walked up to him and asked what was going on. 
He proceeds to tell me he is filling in for his girlfriend who is at home sick. She works for some company that mortgage companies reach out to and have them get photographs to confirm someone is living there. That makes sense because I was behind on my mortgage and whenever I would talk to them they would ask if I was living there and planning on keeping the house. The guy showed me the list of houses he had on the app and it gave him the best route, all the stuff. So I apologize for approaching him that way, he laughed it off and I walked away.
 THEN the police show up and ask what's going on. I explained everything I just listed and told them it's no big deal we sorted it out. They didn't care and asked for our ID anyways. They told me to sit tight while they talked to him. After a few minutes they put him in handcuffs and returned my ID. I asked what was going on and they told me he had out of state warrants and was going to jail. 
I felt like a jerk the entire way home. The reason he was doing it for his girlfriend is they needed the money. I didn't directly get him arrested but I still feel like kind of a Karen here.

So, I'm not going to get too far into this unless I'm told it's necessary, but basically my boyfriend and I (M) used to both be friends with someone. I'll just call him Bob, and I'll refer to my boyfriend as Jim because they were the first names I could think of.

When Jim and I were both friends with Bob, Bob ended up screwing us over pretty badly emotionally. There were many lies that lasted months. In the end Jim was effected so badly that he fell into a spiral of panic attacks, worsened depression and anxiety for over a month. There were other people also hurt by the things Bob had done, but the worst was done to Jim specifically. Something included was Bob having DID, and all of his personalities joined in with the lies and abusive behaviour.

On top of that, somewhere around 1-3 months (I am bad at time) ago, Jim got back in contact with Bob. I didn't trust it for a second, but Jim assured me it was okay, with me trusting him, I went with it. A few weeks after though, Jim complained to me about how Bob's personalities were saying some things, and sent me screenshots. The screenshots very obviously showed several of the personalities once again being manipulative, attempting to guilt him into getting back together with Bob. (Jim and Bob dated at some point throughout the previous paragraph's stuff.) Examples of what they were saying was stuff like, ""Bob is making it hell for all of us with his anger and obsession with you."" Or the one that's 4 just saying simply, ""hey! You're Bob's boyfriend again, right? That's why he keeps talking about you!"". (I'm really suspicious about Bob's DID thought because as far as I know, that's not how it works. But I'm no professional.) This obviously made my distrust for Bob increase a crap ton, the behaviour was continuing again. But Jim wouldn't let me do anything, so I didn't.

I just left it for a while, thinking that maybe they'd drift soon, because Jim said they don't even talk very often. But just today, I messaged Jim asking how he was and his response was, ""I thought you were Bob and I was like ???? you just asked."" So clearly I was wrong, and the two of them are still talking. It just put me really on edge and made me uncomfortable. I haven't said anything about it to Jim, because I don't want to stir stuff up, but I feel bad about being so against him having a friend.

About 3 weeks ago, I was out of work for a week and a half due to a kidney stone. I did everything I could, but by doctors' orders, I was not to return to work until my stone had passed or I was no longer in pain. I brought a doctors note to my manager and she told me she would be taking me off the schedule the following week because it would be the week of Thanksgiving and she couldn't afford having someone cover for me last minute. I agreed to this with the understanding that since my name would not be on the schedule, I would not have those days count against me since I didn't call out for those days. Close to the end of the week, I get a text from my coworker. The conversation went like this.

Coworker: Can you cover my closing shift on Friday? 

Me: I wish I could, but my boyfriend and I have already made plans to go to his mom's for a late Thanksgiving dinner. I'm really sorry.

Cowork: I'm glad to hear you're feeling better, lol...

(I ended up taking the morning shift for that day because that is what fit within my day)

This was obviously super passive-aggressive, and I had no energy to deal with it. This same coworker has made similar passive-aggressive comments to me in the past, and when it was brought to managers' attention, nothing was done.

For the past 2 weeks, everyone has been extremely passive-aggressive to me. I have only been spoken to when something is needed, and the tiniest things that have been wrong were met with a passive-aggressive text message to our entire work group chat. On top of this, my hours have been lacking. I have been receiving two 5-hour shifts and that is all. I have asked to pick up extra shifts, but I am constantly told ""sorry there are just no extra shifts. If someone calls out, we will be sure you get top priority."" but still nothing. This weeks schedule is the same and I am ready to be done.
I have interviews set up for the rest of the week to other places of work because the amount of disrespect I feel from my coworkers is overwhelming.

My partner is a frequent flyer so he gets upgraded often, if not all the time, due to his status. This was our second time flying together. For both times, we purchase our own tickets. On our first trip together last year, he used his travel credit (from a previous trip that was cancelled) to purchase his ticket. Since he probably spent a lot of his money/points to get business, I told him that he should sit in business since that is what he paid for, and it would be selfish of me to ask him to downgrade to economy just so we could sit together. He accepted and sat in business class through every leg of our trip. It was an international trip that was about 22 hours long. I had no problem with this.

However, this time, he was automatically upgraded to business class from economy, and I only found out while we were checking in at the counter. There didn't seem to be any hesitation on his part nor did he discuss with me about how I would feel before he accepted the upgrade.

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or being selfish for wanting him to decline the offer unless I could be upgraded as well. He didn't ask if I could also be upgraded for free so we could sit together nor did he ask how much it would cost to upgrade me.

I was hurt and made a comment at the counter - ""So you want to sit separately?"" His response was that it was a long flight and he wanted to be comfortable. This was a red-eye flight and the total flying time was about 5 hours with a 2.5 hour layover. The first leg was 4 hours and the second leg was 1 hour. I personally didn't consider this to be a long trip for international travel, as we're both used to traveling 20+ hours whenever we travel internationally. I didn't say anything after that and just allowed him to do as he pleased. At the time, I wasn't sure if I was overreacting and I wanted some time to think about it. I also knew that he wouldn't take it well if I told him what to do, so I held my tongue.

Why I'm hurt is because if the roles were reversed, I wouldn't accept an upgrade unless he could be upgraded for free as well or at the very least, have a discussion as to how he would feel if we sat separately. I also thought about what people I know and people we both know would do, and I cannot picture a single one of them leaving their wives/gfs behind to get a seat upgrade by themselves.

My partner is a frequent flyer so he gets upgraded often, if not all the time, due to his status. This was our second time flying together. For both times, we purchase our own tickets. On our first trip together last year, he used his travel credit (from a previous trip that was cancelled) to purchase his ticket. Since he probably spent a lot of his money/points to get business, I told him that he should sit in business since that is what he paid for, and it would be selfish of me to ask him to downgrade to economy just so we could sit together. He accepted and sat in business class through every leg of our trip. It was an international trip that was about 22 hours long. I had no problem with this.

However, this time, he was automatically upgraded to business class from economy, and I only found out while we were checking in at the counter. There didn't seem to be any hesitation on his part nor did he discuss with me about how I would feel before he accepted the upgrade.

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or being selfish for wanting him to decline the offer unless I could be upgraded as well. He didn't ask if I could also be upgraded for free so we could sit together nor did he ask how much it would cost to upgrade me.

I was hurt and made a comment at the counter - ""So you want to sit separately?"" His response was that it was a long flight and he wanted to be comfortable. This was a red-eye flight and the total flying time was about 5 hours with a 2.5 hour layover. The first leg was 4 hours and the second leg was 1 hour.

I also knew that he wouldn't take it well if I told him what to do, so I held my tongue.

Why I'm hurt is because if the roles were reversed, I wouldn't accept an upgrade unless he could be upgraded for free as well or at the very least, have a discussion as to how he would feel if we sat separately.

The gates closed at 12 noon and Tim came at 12:15 PM. The security guards didn’t let him I.

Tim was joined outside by some of our other friends around half an hour before I came. And also, I tried to get 2 professors to talk to the security to let Tim in but they refused due to some reasons. I even had my friend talk to the guards but it was to no avail. Now, after I got out, Tim was extremely pissed at me. I apologised. Jane, who doesn’t even know him, also apologised saying it was because of her that I had to wait.

We’re long distance, and we’re supposed to see each other next week to celebrate in person. However, we wanted to have a facetime date. It was supposed to be lowkey bc we’ll be celebrating next week, but a ft date to connect was important us.

We called for 40 minutes until her parents got home. She was downstairs when they got home and asked “can I hang up to say hi to my parents and call you back?” I said yeah! But, I didn’t hear back from her for 20 minutes. I texted her to check in, thinking she got distracted. She said “sorry i’m talking with my fam” I replied “do you think you could call back soon? You’ve been talking to them for a while and it’s our anniversary you know?” She called me back later and said she didn’t understand why I had an issue with her chatting with her parents when I “took an hour getting starbucks” before calling her

What happened with that, is we didn’t plan a real time to talk. I have chronic sleep issues and have expressed in the past that if she wants to talk at specific times, I need to know in advance so I can work around it. After our naps today she asked if I wanted to call in the next few minutes. I was really out of it, so I needed time to wake up mentally. I also needed coffee so I could actually engage in our call + needed food. I wanted to call her asap bc I didn’t want to leave her waiting, so I asked if 35 minutes was okay. She said that was great.

Unfortunately, it took me an hour to actually get up and do everything. I updated her on what I was doing &amp; apologized for how it took longer than expected. I reassured her that I valued the date &amp; that it meant a lot to me. She told me it wasn’t a problem and we moved on to our date.

So, I told her that the difference was I was late bc I was having sleep troubles. When I was took longer I apologized, sent her updates about what I was doing, and I gave a more lengthy apology when we called expressing how I was sorry and didn’t want to make her feel unpriotized. This was also an issue because it got close to the time where she gets exhausted and will want to go to bed. So, she was using that valuable time during our date on talking to her parents instead.

She didn’t get it and kept using being late as a reason why what she did shouldnt have been a big deal. Also repeated “I don’t understand why I’m not allowed to talk to my parents.” I told her she’s allowed to, but does she see how this situation would make me feel unimportant? That I should be a priory on our anniversary date? I said I wished she just said hi to her parents, told them she was on a date with me, and that she will talk with them later. But she was just defensive. Now i’m wondering if I was asking too much of her?

-Has made me lie to my own family about his drinking
-Has asked me multiple times to buy him liquor

Now, once again, he's drinking, and i just don't care anymore. I tried to be supportive, i even abstained from drinking myself in the hopes that it would help him continue to be clean, but no, it was all for nothing, and i've had enough. If he wants to drink himself to death, he can go right ahead. I've already prepared myself for that reality. Idk if he even has a life insurance policy, or if i'm even listed as a beneficiary, but if i receive any sort of money from his passing, i'm donating a good chunk of it to ALANON and Substance Abuse programs, because if i can't save my own dad, the least i can do is give aid to other people who are trying to make an honest change and better their lives.

Truly a blessing in our lives, but like all dogs, she has her own set of issues. One of these issues is that she is a picky eater and will not accept plain dry kibbles like most dogs. Apparently this tendency is a common trait for this breed that eluded our research on what to expect when raising one before we got her. So basically for all her meals, I have to mix the kibbles with some beef or chicken flavored baby food to conglomerate and then spruce it up with toppings like shredded chicken, lettuce, sweet bell peppers, treats, etc. to make it more appealing for her, to which she'll gladly gobble all up. This is what I've been doing without much thought just to get her to eat. Since the beginning, I didn't mind putting in the extra effort until recently. No, my love for my dog hasn't changed. I just think about how, conceivably, MOST dogs will happily accept a bowl of plain kibbles and how it would be nice if I could do just that and be done feeding her instead of pulling a Gordon Ramsay every single meal. So I come up with the idea of putting down the bowl of kibbles for a few moments, if she doesn't bite, I remove it, and her meal is skipped. I repeat this until her biological need for sustenance eventually overrides her stubbornness and she caves and learns to accept the plain kibbles. My mom disapproves of this idea, citing my methodology as being overly primitive/barbaric/cruel.

Prior to him moving in with me, he had never moved out of his parent's house. He is EXTREMELY close with his family. He texts or calls his parents 24/7. It is nonstop. As I said, they're very close. We go up to their house or they come to ours every single weekend and sometimes during the week. 

My boyfriend and I have a great relationship and almost neverrrr get into arguments. Except for when we do...and it's usually over the same topic. His family (mainly his mother). We both work long shifts, 5 days a week. I feel as if the weekends are the only time we get to spend time together. During the week we normally make plans for the weekend. It never fails, as soon as I start getting ready for our planned outing, he'll say, ""I'm going to invite mom and dad up""... and they usually stay over 10 hours and we never get to do the things we planned. 

This past weekend, I put up our Christmas trees while his parents were visiting. This year, we decided to do a Victorian tree in our dining room and a traditional tree in the living room with all of our sentimental ornaments from our childhood etc. She looked at my tree in the dining room and then looked back at me (with disgust) and said, ""You HAVE to let him put candy canes on that tree! He has done that since he was a kid! IT IS A FAMILY TRADITION!"".  I then had to explain to her (for 3rd time) that we would not be doing that to the tree in the dining room. 

Every Christmas and New Year's Eve he has to go to his parent's house and stay the night because it is their family tradition. Our first year together, I didn't even know about the tradition. Last year, I played along and stayed because I was too nice to say no. However, I will not be staying this year and know it will be a fight with his mother.

I got gaslit again, but this time she explicitly told me she didn’t want old friends to be apart of her new friend group. Ouch. Im also the only one this rule applies to. Im kinda stressed out rn so I can’t remember everything that’s happened but basically her and two other close friends of mine that I came to university with, had a huge friend group of people that I had become friends with when they were around my best friend. So there I was, friends with everyone in the group but completely discluded. I had to delete Instagram because I got so depressed seeing them party every weekend, people who I thought were my closest most cherished friends. I don’t know what I’ve done wrong and I feel so selfish and ungrateful. On the rare occasions we do hangout I have so much fun and she is so precious to me, but as soon as it’s over I feel like shit.

my boyfriend and  been together for2yrs

I found some behavior for the relationship to be disturbing but everytime i voice my opinion it turns into an argument.
For example: 

He has a thing where he says weird stuff as we are talking. that is ok im weird too we do have fun like that sometimes... Like repeat vines to eachother out of nowhere . 
Ilove that about him BUT... yesterday we were talking about a serious thing and he did that thing too many times that i felt unheard so i said "" please try to listen if you want""

And he got offended yelled a little and didn't want to talk and kept quiet the whole time so i expressed that its childish to act this way because it screams ""ido what i want or i wont talk to you"" type of embarrassing childish entitlement and i dont appreciate it from my partner .

He apologized altho it was ""sorry you feel that way "" apology I still accepted it but I also said that I would also appreciate if he reflected on the behavior not just apologize to get rid of the conversation.

More was said then he said"" I don't care if I'm in the wrong let's just stop and let's sleep together ""

I said"" I'm sorry that does not work for me. if you want to sleep you can go to bed but we will be having this conversation .this is detrimental""

 and he said"" I don't care let's just not talk about it ""
I said ""that does not work for me. it's not a patriarchy .your words are not above  mine and mine is not above yours. and conversations like this trigger growth in a relationships. I think is very important whether we have it now or later but I'm not going to let you dismiss me just because you don't want to hear it""

 he did a lot more that I didn't appreciate and hung up on my face then this morning more was said and I told him ""if I am too high for you too much for you you can go ahead and find less because I'm not going to take this disrespect "". He tried to gaslight me and i called that out real quick .

I texted him hours later how some of this behavior is fucked up and a huge red flag and i dont see it as a partnership...

Sorry!

Hi! I (18NB) currently don’t live with my mom (36F) or my younger half-brother (14M) as I am currently attending college. My brother doesn’t live with my mom either, and instead lives with his dad who my mom is no longer with.

A bit of personal background, I really dislike Christmas. I don’t have any gripes with the holiday itself, but for nearly 4 years in a row now my mom has kind of made the holiday a shitshow. I haven’t lived with her since I was 7, but every year I’ve tried to arrange to see her for the holidays, and every year she’s either been late or a no show. 

This is all background to say I decided not to arrange to see my mom this year. I’ll instead be flying to see my dad and paternal family, as I haven’t seen them in about a year. I called my mom to tell her this, and she was surprisingly accepting. My mom is kind of smothering (it was an ordeal the first summer I told her I wasn’t coming to fish camp), so I was surprised to hear she didn’t mind. I offered to have a smaller celebration when our travel plans overlapped, but she denied this, saying she’s always hated Christmas.

This was fine with me, as it put less stress on my calendar, and I asked her if she just wanted to skip gifts as well. She was fine with that and said, “I’ll use you and your brother’s gift money to buy myself something nice.”

I was a bit taken aback, as my little brother wasn’t on this call, so I thought the unilateral decision making was kind of weird. I don’t like arguing with my mom, so I just kind of awkwardly agreed. She said “well, you two never get me anything anyways.” I pointed out that I had bought her a gift the previous year, but she never received it because she didn’t come to Christmas. She acknowledged this and we just chatted before ending the call.

Now, my brother’s dad, as far as I’m aware, makes good money and I have no doubt my brother will get nice gifts. For me, it’s more about my mom just having the care for my brother to get him a gift. Plus, aside from a few side jobs, my brother hasn’t really worked since this year because he’s only 14, so I think it’s unfair for my mom to be upset with him for not getting her gifts. I don’t care about getting gifts, but my brother is a good kid and he deserves better than to not get a gift from his mom on Christmas.

I think I’d be the asshole because it’s not my business and my mom makes less than my brother’s dad, who will certainly get him gifts.

I did prompt my mom by asking, so I feel like it may be my fault, so maybe it’d be better if I just doubled my gifts to my brother.

All feedback is appreciated! I had to cut this post down, so some stuff got removed, so I’m happy to provide more context if anyone wants it.

I prefer not to cook, my roommate on the other hand prefers cooking and is pretty good at it. I prefer cleaning because I’m somewhat of a neat freak and he doesn’t want to clean. So we come up with an agreement, that we will share the bills for groceries, I drive him to the market, he gets to choose the menu and I’ll cleanup. His duty is basically cooking. 

Recently, I noticed that he lacks somewhat basic cleaning stuff. I’m not talking about the dishes, more like pee stain on the toilet seat. My expectation would be him cleaning after himself like after cooking, he’d put dishes into the sink, or wipe the counter with a kitchen cloth after finishing cooking. Overall not deep-cleaning the place as I have that covered. 

Every time I use the kitchen, I notice the countertop has food droppings from cutting stuff, grease and food on the glass cooktop and even the pots and pans not even in the sink but left on top of the counter. He didn’t even cover food with plastic wrap when leave them in the fridge, and I often cover it after. He also leaves pots and pans on the countertop when they’re dry and he needs space on the rack. I also noticed he tends to wash the mugs with water only instead of doing it with soap, because there’s usually a fog/white layer on the mug when he does that. 

I bought pretty much every piece of cookware and provided kitchen cloths and mops all over the place. I know that I have to vacuum and mop the place, and scrub the washroom but do I need to wipe the toilet seat after his piss as well? Even with his cooking, I don’t complain with his cooking and I’ve never asked him to split gas money when we go to get the groceries.

I don’t want to ask much, just small stuff like put the pot into the sinks or clean up after himself in the washroom and wrap up food when he leave some in the fridge and if he wants to wash the mugs/put the pans back then do it properly not some half-way measure. I appreciate the help but we also have a dishwasher so if I’m not at home he can throw them in there.

The other context is that our left turning lane cuts from the road into a 45 degree position while the right hand turn lane is simply straight ahead crossing 1 lane, onto the 2nd lane on the other side of the road (on single lane roads).  

I was driving behind a car on a slight down hill with the car in front riding their brakes the entire time. Must be noted that I wasn't accelerating at all but simply coasting downhill. I wasn't braking until I was gained in on them borderline tailgating before I brake to get some room and rinse and repeat along this single lane road; again not accelerating at all while they were actively riding their brakes.

&amp;#x200B;

We approached a T junction and the single lane opened up a turning lane to the left, which I took. This made it so that we're head and head and so her suv was preventing my vision from the oncoming cars. The whole time, she was reaching over her partner as she was screaming pass the passenger window towards me, on my 'ass riding ways'. She didn't seem to have any intention of turning as it seemed she was more concerned in keeping me there than for the both of us to go on our merry ways.

When I inch forward to get vision of the cars, so did she. Mind you, I could see through her window to see if there were any oncoming cars, but the road is somewhat busy so I didn't want to risk it without full vision. 

The further I inch, the further she did; while blantantly staring and cursing at me. Seeing a small oppotunity through her window, with only a single straggler car from the last pack that just passed me, I reved my engine and got onto the lane since I was already in 45"" position towards the lane and didn't have to cross any lane, I could afford the risk (somewhat cutting off said car). She on the otherhand instinctively inched forward well past the line and her front got smacked by the oncoming vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

She kept blaming me saying that I shouldn't have exit, while the fault (from the insurance perspective) lies with her as she was meant to give way to the car that hit her. 

My friends are saying that I'm the AH because it doesn't matter what she did, she's now the victim of a car accident 'because of me', each saying that I shouldn't have gone without full vision of the road and that in itself is an AH thing to do.

Around 10 weeks into my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage and then I returned home to find my husband in bed with my sister. The two of them tried to apologize and convince me that we could all get over it. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them and even less so when I found out she had gotten pregnant. My divorce was finalized quickly because I wanted nothing from him other than the divorce and was willing to leave the marriage with nothing but the clothes on my back. 

Pretty early I realized my parents were hoping I would want to still be part of the baby's life but I wanted nothing to do with the baby my sister conceived while sleeping with my husband (now ex) as I lay in hospital losing my own pregnancy. I refused any and all contact with my sister and ex. They married and had two more children after the one she concieved during my marriage to him.

I met my current husband when I had distanced myself from my whole family and he was amazing and his family were great. We got married two years ago and his family are nothing short of the best. I adore the nieces and nephews I have gained through my marriage to him and we spend a lot of time together.

Around three months ago my sister called me at work (using my work phone) and told me she needed me and could I please come to her. I hung up the phone and continued about my day. It was several hours later that I got a message from my parents saying I needed to be with my sister. A few days later I got another call and was told my sister had been pregnant, the baby passed away inside of her and she delivered a stillborn all while he was out sleeping with someone else. My parents and sister expected me to rally around her and I didn't. Now that some time has passed and she lives with them, I have been inundated with them saying I should meet her kids, be there for them like I am my husband's nieces and nephews and that I should reconcile with the family. My sister told me how sorry she was again and that she wanted us to make up. I told the three of them that she and her kids are not my problem and I still want nothing to do with them.

My parents are furious and they say I need to forgive because whatever she did, she is now suffering worse than would ever be deserved and her kids are innocent and deserve an aunt.

To me it’s a gift that shows very little thought am I’m not crazy about chocolate and for the same price she could buy something I do like. She knows what skincare brand I like and a moisturizer is about the same cost. Even a gift voucher would be more appreciated as at least then I can choose.

She also refuses to host me and my sister this year as she is “too stressed” from refurbishing the house she is going to sell. A few years back she actually called me and my sister 3 days before Christmas to say she was too stressed to host us so I guess this is an improvement.

She is just insanely selfish, acting like normal mother daughter relations are an imposition.

I had to BEG her to let me store some clothes in her 3 storey house once which she complained bitterly about and when I then asked her to post the stuff to me (it cost 70 euros) she only sent half the clothes because “I’m too busy”. Bare in mind I needed those clothes because it was summer and I had moved abroad for a new job so I only had winter clothes which was rough.

To my mind storing and then sending some clothes is not that much of a favour for your daughter. It’s not like I’m an acquaintance and I often find friends will be way more for me than my own mother. I stayed at an Airbnb recently and the guy forwarded on some packages and refused to let me pay for postage.

She also complains when I don’t call or send gifts for her birthday but at this point I really don’t care. We have a cordial enough relationship because I never bring up grievances but if I never saw her again, I would be fine. 

My mother lives in a lovely 3 story house with her new partner and hasn’t worked since my sister was born, she has no financial worries or time constraints at all.

Anyways, We all used to work together in a restaurant so we have an inside joke about this weird cook who tried to flirt with us by finding potatoes or carrots that were shaped like a penis and put them between his legs as a “joke”. Extremely creepy but it became a joke between us.

So one of my friends, Anniewas having a bad day and we were trying to make her laugh so my other friend, Jennifer put a photo of a penis shaped carrot at her profile pic and I thought it was hilarious so I did the same with a potato pic. Yes, I know. It’s all very silly but it was just a harmless joke to cheer up a friend… or so I thought. 

About an hour later, I got a message from my ex cursing me out and saying “good luck with the disgusting new penis in your life you whore” … I told him to calm down because it’s not a penis and to mind his own business.. he insisted that I was lying and continued to go off on me saying that I posted it on purpose because I wanted him to see it, which doesn’t even make sense because I honestly had no clue he even used the app   and we haven’t spoken for over a month. 

I told him that he should stop stalking me because he’s embarrassing himself and that I hope he knows he’s jealous of a potato.

I (24F) am getting married in 2 months to my fiancé (27M) in my hometown. Fiancé and his family are from out of state. 

My fiancé and I are getting married in my hometown. My fiancé and his family have already made hotel arrangements for where the groomsmen will get ready. Since it’s my hometown, I will be staying at my parents’ house and will be getting ready there for my wedding. 

My mom has already opened up her home for some out of town family to stay (my grandparents and aunt whom I’m very close with) during the weekend. Everyone will be getting ready in her house the morning of my wedding which I’m totally okay with until she mentioned my brother and his girlfriend. 

Background: My brother (23M) has never been in a serious relationship - every girl he’s dated has been very temporary in his life (1 year max together and then he’ll dump her). He’s never said “I love you” or even talked about a future with any prior girlfriends. He’s just one of those guys who always has to be in a relationship…

My brother and his current girlfriend live out of town and my mom was thinking about having them stay at her house which is fine but… I really don’t want his girlfriend in my moms house while I’m getting ready for my wedding. My parents only have 2 spare bedrooms (1 for my aunt and 1 for my grandparents) which means she would get a blow up mattress for my brother and his girlfriend in the living room. 

I know this girl is very temporary our lives due to my brothers track record and quite frankly, I’m honestly not a huge fan of her. She doesn’t have basic manners (I have never heard her say please and thank you) and she’s just awkward to socialize with. I’ll ask her a question and she’ll just look at my brother and he’ll respond for her…  She’s also weirdly dependent on my brother for the most basic necessities. For example, this girl doesn’t even have her drivers license!! She’s literally 24 years old. She depends on my brother for getting her everywhere! My grandmother and aunt also aren’t fond of her for these reasons and her own personal reasons. My mom is trying to be a people pleaser to avoid tension between my brother and myself. 

Now my brother is a groomsman which means he will be getting ready with my fiancé in the hotel room. But that leaves his girlfriend in my parents house where I will be getting ready. I really don’t want her there while I’m getting ready. This is such an intimate time for me. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but this is my wedding. They could get their own hotel room at least. I just want those who are most important to me getting ready with me. My mom is being stubborn about this so I have no clue how to handle it. 

Note: no, money is not an issue at all for my brother. He makes a very good living, so they can afford a hotel room.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4852824,public,top,self,AITA for not wanting my brothers girlfriend in the house while getting ready for my wedding,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc6icl/aita_for_not_wanting_my_brothers_girlfriend_in/,all_ads,6,,,,

There has been a lot of petty drama with my SIL, BIL, and MIL over the years but overall we have remained amicable enough to continue to  talk/ attend family functions. 

However currently I’m not speaking with BIL for very good reason,(context below). I recently invited my in-laws (except BIL) to come to our house for a separate Christmas. 

My in-laws replied that they did not want a party or a dinner because they do not feel comfortable around me since I’m unwilling to see BIL. (we have visited them without BIL a few times this year and what’s more is they are constantly around the BIL without us vacations, events, parties and they don’t feel ‘uncomfortable’ that we are not there).  They said they would only stop by to exchange presents and leave.  This made me angry so I told them if they don’t want to visit with us then to forget the whole thing bc presents isn’t what it’s about, gifts are just clutter.  Now I’m being cast as the villain for canceling Christmas. 

Context around BIL:
Since New Year’s Eve I have now refused to see or talk to my BIL until I feel he has gotten treatment and demonstrated mental stability. I believe my BIL has serious emotional/mental health issues, perhaps is borderline or narcissistic.  The entire time I’ve known him he has had rage outbursts every few months or so. My husband said issues started with him twenty years ago before I was in the picture.  

Last year we allowed BIL to move in our house while going through a divorce.  At first it was fine, then he had a ‘fight’ (rage outburst) with my husband, breaking our property and pushing my husband down the stairs. 

The whole family guilt tripped us into letting him stay in the house for a second chance. However I wanted him to give up access to his guns while living in my house because I felt he’s demonstrated he was too volatile/unstable. This was a point of contention, he was offended by my rule but ultimately looked me in the eye and promised no guns. 

On New Year’s Eve he ended up having another outburst where he threw glasses and bottles and a crystal platter at my husband gashing his head open. He then went up to his room came back down with a gun we didn’t know he had and threatened my husband with it. To my terror, my husband bleeding profusely from his head ‘called his bluff’ and said “what are you going to shoot me? Just shoot me then?”.  BIL ran up the driveway, standing about 5 feet from me held the gun to his own temple and then simultaneously screamed, pulled down gun firing 3 shots into the ground. He fled. The police stormtroopered through my whole house including the nursery.   

I have cut all contact with him (also for my son).  My husband tried to reconnect in June, however my BIL ended up having another outburst, flipping tables over.

This whole dispute is pretty stupid in general but I’m starting to feel guilty so why not. Yesterday, my 13 year old sister was left in the house to look after our dog, he quite a small dog (chihuahua mixed with a shih tzu) so he’s kinda easy to miss. 

Well I got home early from a friend’s house and saw our dog just roaming about in the front garden and was like “why is our dog outside with the front door closed? Who locked him out?” I suddenly realised my sister was the only one home and decided to teach her a lesson and took my dog and entered through the back of the house to get his lead and took him on a walk.

After like an hour my sister called me frantically crying about how she couldn’t find the dog and she’s lost and mum and dad will have it in for her and she would “never forgive herself”. I starting laughing and it’s almost like you could tell the moment she realised. I told her I had the dog and after breathing a sign of relief she started yelling and telling me to come home. She says I “kidnapped the poor dog”, I still laugh thinking about that hence the title. 

Apparently by the that time my off the rails mum had gotten home and I was in for an earful. It was all eventually settled but she’s not talking to me now and I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong.

Bit of background 
My mum had my 2 older sisters with this man, they split after 10 years and went their separate ways and my mum had me with my dad. Who was an aggressive alcoholic &amp; abuser to me and my mum. 

My mum got back with my sisters dad about 10 years who. He was a weekend drinker to which that gradually ramped up to 4/5 days a week but never noticed any addiction. 

He moved out during the covid situation as my mum was vulnerable and he needed to continue his job. Since then he developed an alcohol addiction which was secret for a while. 

Until the last 3 months where he ended up confessing and lost his job and we all including me had to financially keep him. His attempted to quit 3 times and relapsed. 

I have helped in many ways including money (in the hundreds) that I won’t ever get back. I’ve given him helpful talks and arranged and sorted things for him like job interviews and doctors appointments etc. 

This took a huge toll on me and I’ve had a nervous breakdown and it was making me so distressed because I have ptsd when it comes to drunk men. 

My mum broke up with him but is still slightly helping him. My sisters are carrying him and expect me to do so aswell. I’ve made it clear I can’t do no more due to my own mental health but they don’t respect that and keep coming to me. 

2 days ago he ended up in hospital with chest pain and racing heart. Possibly due to alcohol. He still is drinking. 

He says he is depressed and I pointed him in the right direction but at this point I’ve lost sympathy for the drinking part of it. 

It’s my birthday in 2 days and my mum and sisters are being shitty to me because they are all worried and wrapped up in him and his shit that he brings upon himself by drinking. 

They all feel sorry for him but I don’t. I suffer depression and I don’t pick up the bottle. I’m not carrying someone who won’t help themselves. He is wreaking havoc on the whole family.

She has a single mother raising 7 kids in a cramped bungalow. Luckily a few of her older kids now have jobs and she also has my SiL's parents for help. Now my family is quite rich. Like, home by a lighthouse rich. Through my SiL, my parents met Kitty and instantly fell in love.

They love to bring her out all the time to, basically, have her live our kind of life. Fancy dinners, nice clothes, resorts, etc. At first, my SiL would always be present for all those outings, so I thought it wasn't weird that we were bringing out someone else's child. Lately, it's only been my parents and Kitty. The question I have is: ""Is this healthy?"" To plunge another person's child into a completely different lifestyle than the one she lives?

What attitude will she adopt towards her real lifestyle with her own struggling family? What will she think of her mother not being able to provide these things for her and her siblings? What do her siblings, especially her twin brother, think of this? Are they thinking ""Why her?"", ""Why not me?"".

My parents seem to do all of these things under the guise of 'helping her family'. How the hell is feeding her lobster and buying her expensive clothes helping her family in ANY way? Besides buying her mom groceries from time to time, Kitty is literally the only one my parents 'helps'. They keep justifying them parading her around by also saying that 'she never gets to do these things'.

Yes she never gets to do these things but she doesn't have to. Not everyone has to be like us. All these 'extra' things in life are nice but they're also excessive. You don't need any of these things especially since they all could disappear in a second. The image of my dad turning on the power tailgate of his Benz right in front of Kitty's family and their barely-running 2002 minivan to give them all the things they bought Kitty and NO ONE ELSE is just completely burned onto my brain. The amount of shame I felt.

Recently, my parents planned to have us drive cross-country for a vacation. Of course, they toyed with the idea of bringing Kitty along. I outwardly said 'No', and they didn't take kindly to that. I expressed how strange it would be since my sister-in-law couldn't go due to work, and that, oh yeah, THIS IS ANOTHER PERSON'S CHILD. They didn't believe me and instead said I was 'stuck-up' and even insinuated that I 'hated orphans'. I couldn't believe my ears. I tried to explain my concerns further but they were just dead-set on the belief that I was just being an arrogant douchebag and that I hated Kitty, and when my mom said that god wouldn't bless me with a child in the future if I didn't change, I knew the conversation wouldn't be productive, so I just turned the other cheek and let it go.

I was told by A that B made plans to visit the city I am in, but never told me (I was definitely not included since I regularly travel for work and would not be there). They tried making plans to the east coast and then abroad and again excluded. However it’s import that it was just plans.

I decided to ignore everything above and try to invite A &amp; B. Now that I am more settled in. I bought tickets to a concert across the border-City Y (2 hr train), and asked if they would like to join my sister and I. I texted plans, that they could crash at my place, I can show them around, we could take a train to the concert, stay overnight and come back! They all said yes, so I bought the tickets.

In the next few days B texts me that she didn’t want to visit me. That she would want to go to the concert, and stay in City Y. After I told her, I am only planning to stay for a night there, she stated that she would just hang out there with A.

A says that B just wants to plan her own trip, cause I always make the plans. I understand, but I invited them, waited for concert tickets, etc.

Sorry for the long post. So my brother in law is a horrible human being and we do not get along. He was living with my partner when we first met- basically sponging off him and taking advantage of my partner who is the most generous and selfless person I have ever met. We had been together for a while and I tried to tolerate him and eventually after being together for 6 months I found out I was pregnant and we decided to move in together. Because we needed the space for the new baby, my partner told his brother (who was only paying board- not even splitting bills with him) that he would have to move out and find somewhere else to live. My partner already had a 6yo daughter from a previous relationship he has half the time so we needed the extra room for the new baby. We gave him 2 months to find a new place. In that time he didn’t even bother looking for anywhere or even registering for any house because he assumed my partner would cave in and let him stay. So when the deadline came we told him he had to move out and he told us he had a place to go so all good. 
Because my partner basically told him to get out on this date, they had a massive argument and his brother left, stealing my partners only car key to his car so we couldn’t start his car and had to get a locksmith out to change the lock (this is the sort of things he did to my partner that made my blood boil just because he could get away with it)
We had a beautiful baby girl about 4 months after all of this happened and sort of forgot about everything that went on. So my now step daughterstill sees my partners brother through her mums family- even though we are still no contact with him- there are a lot of reasons why aside from this, this was just the last straw. So while m step daughter still sees him, he has been trying to turn my step daughter against me- calling me nasty names and saying I am the reason he has no place to live. For me, the final straw was he told her that her new baby sister- whom she loves and adores was not her baby sister because I cheated on her dad and got pregnant and now I’m pretending the baby is her dads. Which is completely and utterly untrue. My step daughter came to us upset which is how we know what was said. After this I have said his brother is no longer welcome in our house if he cannot be respectful to me and my daughter. My partner is in complete agreement.
Now we have agreed to host Christmas dinner at our house, which is fine, but I have basically said his brother is not welcome. He has made no effort to apologise to my partner or me so he is not welcome.

It boils down to me feeling overwhelmed, overworked, and unsupported. He feels he does enough and I'm too hard to please.

We have no family help. We have no close friends  We have no social support and two young children. 


He does more than the average husband. He cleans and has no problem being left with our kids. But I have to ask for almost everything. 
I'm carrying the full mental load of everything. 

I've explained the mental load to him countless times over the years. He still doesn't understand it. 

It's especially hard for me to manage all of this because I have untreated ADHD. I have about a million systems to manage being able to do these things. And my self care. And I'm in therapy for my very significant childhood trauma (physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and neglect). 

Because of my trauma and sensory problems (possible autism or just trauma idk) I do get triggered and blow up. I'm in therapy. 

For example yesterday was our anniversary. I arranged a babysitter for our older child. I planned a date for us that was baby friendly. I made a schedule and plan that considered lunch for the kids and the baby's nap. 

 When I came home from grocery shopping, he had changed the plan without calling me or talking to me about it. Well, as we were trying to leave, my husband decided to switch out our new carseat with the old one. There was a misunderstanding about it and he ended up yelling at me. 

He left to bring kid1 to the babysitter/playdate and I put baby down for a nap. When he came home, he bought apology flowers but I threw them away. I spent the evening sobbing on the couch and then we got in a big fight and I told him that he half assed things and I can't deal with the pressure of managing everything and our marriage is so bad it's bad for the kids because we fight in front of them. I said that if I was as crappy as he is at everything we would be living in a trash can. It was mean, I know. I apologized. 
We talked it out, and we do love each other very much, but I feel like I've explained and asked and begged and tried everything to get the support that I need and he doesn't see what I'm asking for. 

 I just wish he would take it upon himself to learn to do those things himself. I'm so tired of directing him when I'm already managing everything else. I read marriage books. I plan dates and we have a weekly talk to make sure we communicate. I educate myself about my issues and whatever challenges or kids face. I'm so proactive and he's so passive. 

 I just burn out so easily. I'm in pain a lot and I have an autoimmune disease.  I go to therapy. I try cleaning systems. I have systems to manage my ADHD and trauma and I learn about healthy parenting. He just wants to be told what to do. He does what I ask, but I'm tired of asking.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4852775,public,top,self,AITA for expecting more from my husband?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc664f/aita_for_expecting_more_from_my_husband/,all_ads,6,,,,

Recently, at a family event, we were talking about the happiest times of our lives and I caught my boys telling a story of when I returned from a business trip and we spent the evening together talking about how it was and they literally said ""it felt like time stopped in place"". I remembered, before I met my now-wife, I was away for a week and I was excited to see them. So they were and my sister brought them to the airport to get me. I remember how they ran to me when they saw me.

It dawned on me that it's been a while since I've given them my undivided attention and they must have struggled internally. So I decided to organize a guys getaway weekend and take them to a cabin in the mountains. They were excited. But then, my wife asked what about our daughter.

I have to mention I encouraged my wife to go do something with our daughter by themselves too, but she refused, saying she's busy around the house in the weekends. She demanded we take her too and said she's upset seeing her dad and brothers leaving her behind.

I explained to my wife as gently as I could the reasons I can't take her, including having to focus on the boys ONLY, but she seemed unimpressed. She demanded again we take her and accused me of not caring for her as much. I refused and I am still refusing. She called me an AH and accused me of things I know they're untrue.

The past few months I hadn’t been able to land a job due to the poor job economy in my state (took three months to land the job I currently have). I work part time as I’m a full time student, and I don’t even make $300 in two weeks with my current schedule. I’ve decided to drop out of college as my credit is horrible due to not being able to pay my student loan interest and credit card, and I wouldn’t be able to stay in college even if I wanted to as I’d be denied loans. My fiancé has a good sized apartment, and his bsf lives with him. My bf is perfectly fine with me moving in until my credit is better and I can get my own place, but his best friend has simply said ‘I don’t want her living here’, and gives no valid reason to why. We theorize that’s it’s due to boundaries, like leaving doors open during risky time, or how I dress sometimes, aka booty shorts, which are things I understand and would change these things as I want him comfortable. Id also get another part time job or full time (which Ive already been interviewing for), so I can help pay rent and utilities while there. they work for the same company but different locations, my fiancé makes around $450 a week, while the bsf makes nearly 600+ as his location is full of college kids. My boyfriend would like me to be there to help with the payments so he can save more money, as their rent takes nearly his entire paycheck, while the best friend has hundreds of dollars extra and doesn’t realize how privileged he is in the situation. This best friend has also lived with my fiancé and his parent for 7 months without paying rent, so we all feel like it’s incredibly hypocritical considering how much is family has done for him. I cannot move to my family’s home as it’s 2 hours away and I would have to find a job, again, which would be even harder in their location. We theorize that his bsf may be jealous, as he’s on his third ‘relationship’ this year, and my fiancé has been in two long term relationships (me being the second.)

I arrived early enough to secure a decent spot to view the festivities.  Moments before the parade began, a pair of Salvation Army volunteers arrived and set up their spot about two feet from me.  If you are not familiar with this organization, they ring a loud, shrill bell to bring attention to their donation kettle.  

One of the pair approached me since I was so close and asked if I minded that he was going to be making some noise.  The conversation went as follows:

Salvation Army Worker: ""Just so you know, we're setting up here and will be making a bit of noise.""

Me: ""Must you?""

Salvation Army Worker: ""Yes.""

Me: ""Well, that's inconsiderate.""

Salvation Army Worker: ""Well, maybe your good deed for the day would be to tolerate it.""

One of the features of the parade was musical performance.  Nevertheless, he began to ring the bell and play music from a Bluetooth speaker right next to all the parade watchers.  There was no way I was going to enjoy the parade with this racket right next to me.  

Apart from that interaction, we introduced each ourselves to each other, shook hands and told one another ""Merry Christmas.""  I wouldn't say our interaction was contentious, but I did let him know I felt about his subjecting the spectators to the noise.  I decided to move to a less desirable spot after a short while so I could actually hear the performers properly.

Confounding factor 1: I suffer from chronic pain and chose my spot since I could sit against a railing to ease that a bit.  Moving meant I was going to be in more pain than I would have been, but there's no way anyone could have known that.  

Confounding factor 2: I have very little love for the Salvation Army.  I am a gay man, and the Salvation Army has a history of opposing decriminalization of homosexuality, marriage equality and non-discrimination ordinances.  I won't give one cent to an organization which, had it been successful, would have me imprisoned or unable to marry.  Instead, I donate to other organizations without the Salvation Army's unfortunate history.  

These two factors may have made me less agreeable than normal.  I am willing to give the worker the benefit of the doubt that he is trying to doing something positive to help others this holiday season.  He may not know about his organization's history as well.

Not sure where to begin but here goes: it's a Sunday, after a whole week of non stop working, so that Sunday is our only day off for the week. My wife and I just sat on the couch for half the day on our phones, sometimes chatting. I know she's bored. She said she might want to play some mariokart. When I said I want to play games on my PC, she makes a face. I'm familiar with this reaction. Seeing this I sit back down. God forbid I was having fun while she has nothing to do. Then I dozed off, maybe for half an hour.

When she noticed she got mad. Stomping her feet. I asked what's wrong. She complains that i rather sleep than do stuff with her. Asked why I never want to do anything with her. At this point there's no avoiding the argument, so I just said I dozed off. So she is just sulking at the moment.

So I kinda guessed she might want to play Mario kart or something else together. So I said let's do that, but it's too late, she's already angry. It's not enough that I play with her, but she wants me *to want* to play with her.

Now it's not like I hate playing games with her. It's just that I don't feel like playing the games that she wants me to play with her (casual games and easy to get into games like Mario kart or Smash). And she definitely won't play the games that I want to play (monster hunter, grand strategy and simulation games).

 I get that she only wants to spend time with me. But I cant seem to bring myself to *want* to do that. With her I prefer to watch a movie  on tv. Though most of the time if I were to invite her to watch something she'll most likely turn to her phone while I'm engaging with the movie alone. Still, I would still play with her if she had asked. But she's angry that I don't want to, or didn't make the first move.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I prefer to play games alone. Even with monster hunter I play with randoms, so they might as well be faceless AI. Of course I never tell her this, because I don't want her angry.

AITA? If yes, how do I make myself *want* to do stuff with her? I might have left out a few things that might be important, feel free to ask. 

I'm tired of these arguments, and it feels like the only way to make her happy is to force myself to do things I don't feel like doing before she gets bored or frustrated.

I (20F) wanna state that I love my parents and older brother (27M) a lot, they've been supportive of my decisions, helped me a lot emotionally etc.....   


My brother Eric is basically a loser as harsh as it may sound. We have free college education in our country and he was supposed to finish 3 years to get his undergrad in computer science. But since he had his studies at the back of his head all the time, he actually took about 6 years to pass because he kept failing for, get this, not attending class.    


His degree is so easy to get but he kept partying, getting arrested for drug use and drunk driving and staying asleep til 12 AM while his classes start at 8. And he didn't even have anything to do at home because he lives with mom and dad and hthey constantly are worried for him because he keeps throwing away his future. He graduated about 6 months ago and mom and dad got him a contract to work abroad by taking out crazy loans and using a lot of connections.    


I am in my 2nd year in veterinarian school and I worked my ass off to get here, i wanted actual medicine I couldn't pass the MCEs because there was limited spots. Seeing Eric barely putting any effort in his life and having a life changing oppertunity in a MUCH better country in europe out of thin air makes me feel just sad tbh. Our mom always talks about how much she struggles to fund for his future and pushing him to be a better person and dad doesnt even wanna talk about it.    


They expect nothing but sheer perfection from me but went batshit crazy on me when I asked them if I also could have (PARTIAL) financial help to me get my master's in the US or CANADA. I was called jealous, selfish and childish and deadass was dismissed with the saying ""make the money yourself"". All I was asking for is help to pay rent and appliances. I could literally get a scholarship from my current college.   


After their breakdowns I broke down crying, I pointed out the favoritism and how much pain and misery I've gone through in order to be the succesful kid they used to cover for their son's failures, how many tears and hours I poured to get into veterinarian school and how I always appeared not bothered by their nasty, stingy critics of my grades or minor inconveniences in my life when I was bleeding from the inside.   


I went back on campus and went airplane mode but my bff who lives near my college told me that they're begging to have a chance to talk it out and how much I made Eric feel bad about getting this oppertunity, Idk what to do and I feel bad to putting him in hindsight because I do love him.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4852730,public,top,self,AITA for calling bs over parents' favoritism?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc5sob/aita_for_calling_bs_over_parents_favoritism/,all_ads,6,,,,

My mom now can’t get into her garage after coming home from work because there’s a f250 smack dab in the middle of our driveway. Not to the side, literally at the very beginning of the driveway taking up all the space. So this Christmas parade I saw the same f250 and walked by him while he sits in his truck and gave him a confused look while walking to my house. A look of “do I know you and why are you in my driveway?” I look at my house and look back at him and he scoffs, rolls his eyes, and pulls out. A old lady parks her car on my grass.

I have never met D and only know little about him from what my sister tells me.
A few weeks ago I went to the city for a girls night with my friends I invited my mum along since I hadn't seen her in awhile and wanted to catch up while I was there. By this time my sister had told my mum that I knew about D so I specifically told my mum it's a girls night we're not bringing partners. She was super excited and was like yep definitely just girls. So we go to our first cocktail bar and we're having a good time singing kareoke and I notice this guy hanging out by my mum but walking away when I would come back to the table and one of my friends even mention like ""hey I think that guy is flirting with your mum' and we have  a laugh and carry on then we go to the next bar and 15mins later that same guy is there with my mum again so mum and I are in the bathroom together at one point and I'm like 'hey, is that D?' And she was like yeah I told him where we were. I was like mum it's a girls night!! We didn't argue or anything she just giggled and walked back out to him and I carried on kareoking with my friends and mum. I was getting drunk and having a good time and didn't think it a good time for introductions with D so we didn't meet that night.
Anyway fast forward 2 weeks to lastnight and I rang mum to ask if she could make a steam pudding for Christmas (I'm hosting Christmas this year so all my siblings families and mum are coming and all though I will be providing the whole main courses I have asked each family to bring a dessert) anyway I call her up and she says oh yeah D and I will bring a steam pudding. I was like hold on a second D is not coming. She asked why and I said well I know very little about him considering you're keeping him a secret from us this whole time and the only thing I do know about him is that he crashed our girls night. I just don't think Christmas is the time to meet this guy you've been seeing for only 2 months. Maybe you guys could host a BBQ  in the new year and we'll come to that and meet him. She then said she wouldn't come to christmas cause he's not invited and I'm an asshole cause now she's missing out on Christmas with her kids and grandkids because I won't let him come too.

3 of my siblings agree with me but my sister who has met him and knows more than we do because mum lives with her said I should let him come too.

As time went, she started dry texting. As a person with trauma from toxic relationships, I was scared. I made sure to check if she's taking care about herself. Got a message ""everything is good"". 

After while, she started hanging out, I respect it can't be just two of us, but later, going out w them became more important than our calling when sick. Unintentionally I started checking if she's outside, how long etc. Yes, I was an idiot for this one, it was a huge mistake, but I apologized so much after I knew what I've done.

When it became only dry texts, not receiving any compliments and ignoring my needs, I asked what's happening, she said its too much school till christmas. I reminded her that everything is going to be okay and that I'm there.

Recently, I went home after school. To find out she started smoking and drinking, she's never done that, we both hate these things. I begged her to stop or make it less. Later, I tried to respect it and just say ""okay just when we're not together"" and she said it was just a try.

Next day I asked her if she wants to play MC &amp; call (it was our comfort) on which she answered ""I don't have time, I have a sleepover"".I respected that school had to drain her and she wanted to have fun.

Only to find out the next day, she smoke whole pack with her friend and drank. I begged her to stop, that I want her to stay,  there are different ways to have fun, she's my gf and its harming our relationship, cuz I am scared of these things (cancers in family), on which she only said ""idc, dont worry, no"" etc. No emotion.

I broke up with her cause seeing cig pics on stories gave me such a heartache. I told her mom to take care of her, yes, she's gonna be mad at me, but I still value her life, she doesn't deserve any pain in future. For my mental health after this, I blocked her. She never apologized, her last message was dry as hell. Just to find out that after blocking, my friend sent me screenshot of her stories. Someone asked her, if she has time to go outside. The only thing she said was ""I always have time"" so no school ig.

So cigs and alcohol were worthier, than me, who stayed for months when she was down. After ignoring me, she didn't give  a damn about my mental health.

I think it was her fault for lying and not respecting my fear, but I feel guilty for the way I left her. It was too much on me, I didn't feel loved the past month. Ive been shaking for past days cuz of it, and she doesn'tseem bad about it. I want her to have happy life. I don't know why she changed, if it was because of me or idk. I just miss when she cried how much she misses our cuddles, not cigs.

Something is still telling me that I should return, I can't leave people even if they are harsh. Everyone said I did a good thing, but the feeling of waking up alone is ugh. I still have hope that even if our relationship failed, she change back and realizes what she lost.

However, I managed to find an activity that required me to help out in the kitchen – cutting vegetables, cleaning, and serving customers if needed.

However, my mother had refused, citing the dangers of working in the kitchen (ie. cutting the fingers, slipping on wet floors.), and wanted my father to accompany me to ensure my safety. However, my experiences with the knife had never resulted in injuries, so I thought her points were not valid enough. She also wanted me to volunteer for other activities I lack interest in – the majority which involve communicating with others. 

I was aware of these opportunities. However, I did not choose these activities as I did not have the most welcoming personality, and have bad social skills.

She told me to count them, which I did, but I asked her to count them too to make sure I had everything. I begged her for two weeks to count them with me, but she always said that I was responsible enough even though it was the first time I had to count them. She had done it in previous years, so I wanted her to help me for the first time and if everything went well, to count them the following years myself.

But I didn't notice that 3 textbooks were missing, and as a punishment, I had to pay for new ones. When I told her to ask my aunt for her money back, she said that she couldn't for some reason and that it was my fault and that she couldn't trust me anymore.

At the beginning of the year, the professors said that we also need workbooks for some subjects. Me and my cousin have the same professors. I didn't need those extra books last year. I also had to pay for that because I should have known that I would need it even though no one told me or implied that I would. I spent almost HRK 1,000 just on those books and I'm still angry about it.

Why do I have to pay for all this when my cousin is just as guilty? He is the one who counted those books. It's also my aunt's fault because she sold us those books for full price and didn't refund the money for them after we told her they were some missing. Let's not forget that a male genital organ was drawn on each book, and that was done with a pen, so I couldn't erase them. I wanted to tell my aunt about those drawings, but my mother said that then my cousin would be in trouble and that I had better keep quiet about it. I did erase those a bit into the school year but still, it didn't need to happen.

So I was born and mom had negative feelings for me. We lived with my grandparents most of my childhood. When I was about 6 mom started to take more of an interest because I think the idea of having a little girl to dress up and do makeovers with was fun to her, but I was never into makeup or clothes. I'm not the girl she wanted me to be and mom lost interest after I refused to go around wearing these sparkly dresses she'd find for me.

When I was 13 we moved out of my grandparents and into a place together. 6 months later her now husband moved in. Two years later she was pregnant and had a baby girl who is now 8 months old and she's expecting again. Mom has been so happy and has been such a different mother to her baby and she's even excited to be having a boy now. 

A few weeks ago she wanted me to babysit so she and her husband could have a date night. I told her I was busy. She told me I could be unbusy and help out in the family. I told her that wasn't going to happen. She said to see it as bonding time with my sister. I told her I didn't need any bonding time and I was going out so she better find someone else. She threatened to punish me, I asked her how, she stared at me for the longest time because she had no idea what would matter enough to me to take away. She ended up paying a sitter. Then a few days later she told me again that I would be babysitting. I told her my answer was the same as the previous time and that she could forget me ever babysitting. She was all why the hell not, she told me I owed her and that I was making her wish she had left me at my grandparents. I told her she should have and then she wouldn't need to worry about her little family where she has one of each (what she said a couple of times after finding out she's having a boy this time). I told her she was dumb to think I'd help her or want to spend time with her kids when she has made it clear she never wanted to be my mom and that I was never enough for her.

She got so mad that I called her dumb and told me I was the biggest regret she had and why the fuck could I not realize I owed her. Her husband told me calling her dumb was cruel and that it's offensive to others.

AITA for saying that the school show was bad?

I'm a 14 year old boy that has a lot of drama in his life.

However that is not what i'm talking about right now.

For context, I go to a very artsy private school. It has a huge music program. Like more than half the school is in orchestra or choir. The school decided to put on a little fundraiser thing and I walked by the choir and orchestra while they were playing. Later that day I made a comment that the orchestra was off-key and my homebase went off on me. They said that I didn't belong here and that they worked hard on it.

You can work hard on something and still be bad at it FYI. Worst part is the director even agreed that it was bad and off-key.

I asked one kid if he didn't want me here so badly then he could drag me out himself. He said maybe I will and that's funny because he looks like a kindergartner.
