I believed this and did not know he was doing a joke on me. 

Now I realize I may be ridiculous but I never bothered to think much about this and just kind of accepted this idea even as an adult. I never bothered to ponder that it is silly and not how it works. But over Thanksgiving I overheard my Aunt tell my cousin ""Remember when you convinced aita_pig that pigs are a hybrid between goats and cows?"" The whole family laughed. 

This confused me at first, but as soon as I thought about it I was kind of like ""wait, I guess that is kind of weird."" I googled it and of course a pig is a pig and not a combination cow/goat. I couldn't believe I had gone through life believing this. I just never questioned it I guess. 

So at dinner I decided to get back at them and said I like Thanksgiving because we have turkey which is a natural animal instead of a hybrid animal. They said, what do you mean, and I said I am glad we don't eat ham on this day, because a pig is a hybrid of a cow and a goat. Everyone thought I was doing a joke reference to the old prank, but I said ""No I know he thought he was doing a joke, but I always thought it was funny it turned out pigs actually are a hybrid. He thought he was pranking but was telling the truth, very ironic.""

Then people got confused. I explained to them with authority and with a convincing tone that it turned out pigs really were made by crossing cows and goats, that they are a true hybrid animal and I had researched it. Everyone started telling me to stop doing a joke but I kept insisting it was true. One of my cousins was like ""Do you really believe this???"" And I said of course, I had done my research. 

I was hoping to convince some of them it was true but none of them seemed to be believing me so my counter-prank was backfiring a bit. I then said that everyone was apparently scientifically ignorant to not know this about the origin and production of pigs.

The next day to the family groupchat I sent screenshots of a Wikipedia article, but I edited it on my computer to make it look like Wikipedia was saying pigs are a hybrid of goats and cows. Everyone told me I need to drop the act, but I think they have it coming for gaslighting me for almost thirty years to think the same thing.

We don't talk or communicate as often as we used to as we kinda had a little falling out so our friendship is a little strained and iffy.

Last Christmas my friend surprised me by showing up out of the blue and gave me a expensive gift of a PS4 and about 6 games. I felt caught off guard by it and while the gesture was sweet, it felt weird to me because it seemed like this gift he spent on me was overboard and felt like it came with underlying motives of Luke trying to ""buy"" back our friendship. I reluctantly took it and have used it.

Recently, he reached out again and explained that his friend was on hard times and could use a PS4, and asked if he could have the one he gave me back.

This irritated me because this PS4 felt like it was never a gift for me... like I was just borrowing it without knowing. But despite that, I've always had weird feelings about keeping and using the PS4 since he gave it to me last year and kinda never wanted it in the first place.

I told him at first that sure, he can take it back because I don't mind helping his friend (who I don't even know) but mostly I just kinda wanted it gone and out of my hands. But he's never actually came to claim it and since I still have it in my possession and technically it is ""my"" PS4... lately I was thinking of selling it to make a quick buck.

The problem is I told him I'd give it back and I don't want to just turn around and sell it without communicating first to him... I don't want to upset him. I know I don't owe him or his friend anything but it feels wrong to go behind his back and do something to where he wouldn't be able to give it to his friend when I said I would give it.

With a commute my work day is 7:45am-6:15pm.

My wife is a full time stay-at-home mom.

I have the option to work from home Mondays and Fridays - it hasn't worked in the past.

I'm asking my wife to take the baby 7:00am-6:15pm during weekdays so I can work. 

I'm getting strong pushback.

AITA?

Context: We have a low sleep needs 2yo that’s up multiple times a night. On the first wakeup, I transfer kiddo to our bed where my wife nurses kiddo back to sleep. On subsequent wakeups my wife nurses kiddo back to sleep in bed. Constant wakeups mean she is generally tired. She also doesn't nap easily, so if she isn't getting her sleep overnight she's probably not making it up during the day. I should say upfront that she is a wonderful and committed mother.

I don't have some kind of sexist idea that my wife should do all the childcare. I love spending time with kiddo in the mornings, in the evenings, and on weekends. To be fair, kiddo has recently had some separation anxiety (very normal), so she prefers to spend time with mom even when I'm home, but I do try to take her away (to the convenience store, to the park etc.) so mom can have some alone time. 

Nevertheless it’s true that mom ends up spending almost the whole day with kiddo and she understandably gets 'touched out'.

I started a new job about a year ago remotely.

I've just started coming into the office physically T/W/Th. The current arrangement I have with my wife is that I have kiddo from wakeup (which is usually 6-7) until 7:40. Initially I thought that M/F I'd be able to let my wife sleep right up until 8:30 which is when I start work, and then WFH.

However... I'm increasingly thinking this isn't ideal because:(1) I am a terrible remote worker. This has been an issue for my last three jobs (inc the current one). I was fired from my previous job - I can't say it was all because of remote working, but I suspect many of the issues would not have come up were it not for my working remotely during the pandemic. 

I have now gotten a series of poor reviews at work at my new job. I don't feel like I am at risk of being fired again, but naturally it's something that weighs on me. Now that I'm coming into the office I've definitely noticed my productivity increase.

(2) The 7:40am handoff time basically leaves zero room for error. If the bus is early, or if I forget my phone and have to walk back a few minutes, I am late for work. Also, selfishly, I'd like to be able to shower in the morning without kiddo - who hates showers - but I can probably try to get more creative, maybe do baths if she'll let me.

To solve both problems, I’m asking my wife for a 7:00am-6:15pm M-F work shift. 

My wife rightly points out that this would cut out her M/F morning later wakeup, and 40 minutes off most other mornings, and that she is already sleep deprived.

I feel like I'm just asking for a normal work day - with a little bit of lead time to prepare for it.

One guy joined the team in September. Pretty early on he started listening to music through his laptop speakers. Not blaring but loud enough to distract me from my work. I was pretty surprised when it became an every day thing. Especially since we all have to make phone calls a lot. 

Pretty early on I said “do you mind putting in headphones?” But he didn’t put in headphones, he just turned it down lower. I went to my manager (along with the other person sharing the space bc she doesn’t like it either) and we let him know since it was continuing after I said something. He said let me know when it’s happening through our chat, and I’ll come in and then it can be through me and not involve you. I thought great, perfect solution. Well that hasn’t worked out and basically the manager still hasn’t dealt with it. 

Cut to today like 2-3 weeks since I brought it to the manager. I’d had enough. I said “do you mind putting your headphones in I’m having trouble focusing?” He replied “You can hear that? I can barely hear it?” I said yeah I can. Maybe my ears are just more sensitive. He paused and said “That’s really bothering you?” I said that it was. He said “I’m not having ear buds in all day. I’ve always been able to listen to music at an office”. 

Im just thrown off totally. It’s super uncomfortable. I thought it should be a no-brainer. Our colleague messaged our manager after she walks in on the tail end of it and says “we have a situation”. He comes over after music guy has left the room and asks about what happened. So at some point we are both meeting with him later supposedly but hasn’t happened yet. It’s so awkward.

Boy then talks to girl on snap for a month, finally girl agrees to meet in person, Girl ghosts on day of movie date, then blocks boy saying she is nervous, girl unblocks boy later next day apologizes, they resume talking now using snap voice messages. 4 weeks later\[2 months total now\] after texting daily on snap for 2 months girl meets boy. Girl enjoys boy they hang out again the next week. The next week girl is doing her taxes, boy is asking about hanging out as they planned that Wednesday. Girl tells boy she is stressed boy says no problem in his message.\[They are sending voice messages on snap at the point not actually text and have been doing this since one month passed.\] Boy tells girl no worries just let him know if they are still hanging out. Then says ""Fuck it whatever"" at end of voice message. Boy was unfortunately playing league of legends and didn't realize his message was still recording, he was incredibly pissed a kaisa was going AP on Aram \[context this is bad since they had no physical damage and only magic on team\]. Girl sees message and then blocks boy saying ""This isn't working out""

Boy apologizes profusely trying to explain. Girl blocks boy on everything and says he should have thought of it before he said it basically blaming boy.

4months later boy sees where girl lives one night randomly. 2 Months after that boy buys a gift, goes to her house and knocks on door, leaving voice message on her ring, he also leaves a note with his contact information explaining on it he will never return to her unless she contacts him, he explains in ring audio message that it was a giant misunderstanding, and it hurt him to know she thought of him like that etc, and he understood it was unorthodox to show up but he had to get this weight off his chest.

Boy leaves. Boy feels better but friends thing boy crossed a line even if no real laws were broken.

Boy thinks of it pragmatically. He struggles to feel emotionally for a girl who hurt him so bad while blaming him for it.

1. She hears/sees note gift ignores it and goes about life. He vent get closure and go on feeling better.
2. She hears sees and feels bad and contacts him, he still got closure and whatever happens happens.
3. She sees hears freaks out and is upset, which never negatively can affect him because (I broke zero rules and was respectful) and he get closure and feel better.

There is zero outcome negative here for him

One net positive for her, one net negative for her, one neutral for her.

The ways I assist are not clearly outlined but there are expectations. 

One of my coworkers, “Ana” did my job before me. She got promoted to be one of the positions I assist. There’s about a dozen people I assist in total. Ana has the easiest caseload, by design, since she’s newer to the position. She gets simpler files that require less work. 

She has been in this position for a few years now, just as I’ve been in my assistant position for the same time frame. 

Even though she has the easiest case load, she sends me the same amount of work as the other people. Helping her is 50% of my workload, while the other half is from the other ELEVEN people who have more complicated cases. In addition she has me complete things that are well outside my role.

I‘m gonna start this off by saying I love my family dearly and would do anything for them. 
Although in my opinion blood is not the only thing that makes family. 

My Grandma has a Brother (about 75-80) but my family hasn‘t been in contact with him for about 15 years.
Which was mostly because he didn‘t bother to pick up the phone or contact us in any way shape or form.
He wasn‘t even interested in his own daughter and used to tell her how little he cared about her since her earliest childhood days. 
We used to call him ""Munchhausen"" and the only thing we talked about regarding him was his tendencys to tell lies and make false promises.

Until last year. 
He suddenly called my grandma and we eventually went to visit (he lives about an hour away). 

Since then my grandma, aunt and my grandma‘s other brother have been in contact with him from time to time and he came to visit us this year.
He really only showed interest for my Cousin because he‘s a boy.
He wouldn‘t even know my name from the top of his head. 
He still doesn’t want anything to do with his daughter, even though she tried, because he blamed her for not contacting him all these years and only talks down on her. 

Now onto the problem

About 2 years ago he (btw a heavy smoker) has a fire break out in his backyard, the potting soil in his flower pot started burning and left some damage on the floor as well as the wall.
He tried suing the manufacturer, because he swore the potting soil started burning because of the sun, which obviously didn’t work. 
Now he‘s pretty bad in dept and isn‘t really financially stable anymore, even though his pension payment is decently high.

My aunt as well as my grandma decided now for all of us, that this years christmas is gonna be without any presents, in order to send him the money we would‘ve used for it. 

I honestly think that‘s ridiculous.
Yes presents are a part of christmas but far away from beeing important.

I used to crave for her love and approval but now, I want nothing to do with her.

I have 3 siblings - (29 ys, 40 es, 42). When my mom got her part of inheritance, she managed to lose the money within 2 months (she claimed she was robbed but we all know she lost it gambling, she’s a big gambler). She and my elder sister bought a house where my mom paid for the deposit and my sis pays for mortgage. Since my mom doesn’t have money to support herself anymore (she has never worked in her life), and my sis couldn't keep supporting her and pay for the house, they ended up losing it.

My mom moved with my younger sis who was in college then. My e.s. rented them an apartment while we both paid for her living expenses. We had to move her to 5 different apartments almost every year since she uses the deposit without telling us and landlord had to contact us when the bills weren’t paid.

1st yr when she lived with my y.s., she abandoned her saying she will visit our ancestral house but never came back. My sis called us crying bec people came at the apartment claiming my mom owed them money. My sis was 18 at the time. Both of us (e.s and I) were out of the country for work so there’s only so much we can do. Our eldest urged her to stay with him (few hours away) while we sort things out.

After 2yrs, she moved back to where my y.s. lives but their relationship was never the same. When my e.s. and I moved back home, she decided that she will let our mom stay with her and her family. We felt like we can’t do anything since she’s penniless and have nowhere else to go. Our eldest is also not an option since he's NC with her.

My mom stayed with my e.s. for almost a year but we recently discovered that she had been stealing from her. One night, they decided to check their security cam and saw my mom go in her office and get money from her wallet. This made my sis very angry and found out that for the past couple of weeks, she had been doing this in the middle of the night. That was her last straw. She contacted our y.s. and she reluctantly agreed for her to stay there. They didn’t ask me since I live with my bf at his house &amp; parents. The worst feeling is not feeling safe at your own home. She also did the same to me years ago. I still didn’t want to believe my mom can do such a thing until this happened again with my e.s.

Now that the holidays are near, we are planning for a get together and my e.s. invited us at her house on the condition that we don’t bring our mom. I’ve been losing sleep since what happened with our e.s. I know my mom’s toxic and she will never learn. But I also feel like we’re abandoning her this Christmas and even though none of us are happy being with her.

So I got a new day job, but I moonlight by taking a shift here and there at a pawn shop on skid row.

Friday, I was working the electronics line when this big dude, probably 6'4 330# comes in with a speaker. IT was a busy day, considering it was the first of the month. We had a long line.

The big dude was hollering at me about having to wait in line and how he's been waiting for 30 minutes. My teammate told him that he had to wait his turn like everyone else, and when it's his turn, we'll tend to him. He fired back with ""that's some straight up bullshit.""

AT that pawn shop, we have each other's backs, and the owners tell us all the time we have the right to refuse service. After this dude kept trying to bully and menace his way to have his turn, I decided to invoke that right.

I chime in with ""tell you what, we're not interested in your item. Take it elsewhere."" That prompted our security guard to step in. He didn't do anything, but the big dude kept talking, asking me why I needed him. I explained that he was causing a scene and it's his job to make himself present when a customer causes a scene. Long story short, guard bounced him out.

About 3 hours later, owner calls me into his office. Apparently big Ken (female equivalent of Karen) called and said I was disrespectful. I iterated you telling me (and all employees) that I had the right to refuse service, and I wasn't letting that dude menace my teammate or my customers.

While he said I had a point, he also said that he had something of value, so to refuse his item based on his behavior alone was wrong, and that he meant the ""right"" was more intended for the items brought in than the customers (unless they're on our blacklist, which means they're flagged in our system for trying to scam us -- in that case they're never doing business with us).

I have a stepbrother Matt(29M) who's been living at home &amp; managing the family business. 


When I was 17 they got married &amp; we four moved into a bigger house in a different city &amp; I don't think Matt had anything against it cause he had admitted to me that he loved being around my Mom &amp; how she took great care of him. Matt &amp; I were both loners so we became friends pretty soon. Hes warm, sweet &amp; kind to me but after marriage he became distant &amp; cold &amp; even asking him I never knew why. 


I moved to a different state when I was 22. Matt &amp; I stayed in low contact although it later became almost nil(Mom later told me that he got a gf altho hes broken up with her now &amp; also managing the business took a toll on him) but its understandable &amp; now while I'm home there's a stark difference in his behavior. He's sweeter more affectionate &amp; idk what to make out of this. I've never been a hugger &amp; also I'm very sensitive to unfamiliar touches hugs. He would often hug me too tight or pat my back repeatedly. I mean I know how some brothers work but it's been a pure discomfort &amp; now he's started telling me how I deserve better, how there're better men close around me. I told him off so many times but to no avail which is why I told all these things to Mom. She blamed his recent breakup &amp; how he must be understanding my pain &amp; so hes being extra comforting which sounded mostly bs but still convincing. I never told these to Peter as I didn't want to bring any extra tension at home. 


Yesterday Peter arranged a family dinner to celebrate the success of a new product &amp; many people from both my Mom's &amp; Peter's side were there. When I walked up to the table, I noticed Id have to sit beside Matt which I did(there're no extra seats) In the middle of dinner I felt something tapping along my thigh(I was wearing a sheer A-line dress) &amp; no surprise its Matt. I causally put it away from me bt after a few seconds its back &amp; now instead of tapping, hes kind of caressing. I glared at him only to receive an innocent smile so a plan came into my mind. I put my hand on his on my lap &amp; loudly asked him, ""Do you know where we live?""


Him : XYZ. 


Me: So wtf do you think youre doing by caressing my thigh stepbro? It's not fcking Alabama you perverted idiot. 


The whole table fell silent &amp; I could see everyone being tense as I waved our intertwined hands in air. Matts face got beet red &amp; he quickly left the table.

She offered to pay me money to do chores for her so that I could save up to get her and the family some gifts, but it wasn’t a lot of money, and I told her I didn’t think working for 2 dollars an hour was really worth it.

She got really upset with me and said I was selfish and started crying.

I (18m) was going to go out with my friends a few weeks ago. I was driving, but when I went to one of their houses to pick them up they didn't put on their seatbelt. I told him to put it on, and he said he didn't need it since we were only driving for a few minutes. I told him to put it on, and he said no again. I told him I was not leaving until he put it on, and he said it'd be fine and we can go. I told him that if we crash and he dies because he didn't put on his seatbelt, that blood would be on my hands since I was the one who let him stay like that, so he can either put it on or leave.

We are renting at $950 a month and we have a combined salary of 45k (40k me 5k her) we are not able to save much and we are financially unable to save a nest egg renting here without hard sacrifice and luck nothing bad will happen.

This is where it gets messy, disclaimer we were near homeless we stayed 2 months in an extended. We have moved 3 times in 2 years. It was a hard and challenging process for my family. 

My mom and sister (35f income 200k) in Indiana has endured and consoled me saying how hard being a new father is and the reality of responsibility and providing. (Lacked a father growing up) Also they have watched us endure the hardships from afar. They have helped in the past with money and gifts for our child in the past. My mom then shocked me with an offer. She was going to sell our home we grew up in, but she wanted to offer it to me. She will sign it over and my family can live there. Couple catches if we can't sell the home until we have a home to move into. And we need to move in before Feb. Due to it will be empty and she is afraid of someone squatting. To move to Indiana from Florida $3k which my sister is willing to pay for.

I mentioned that this opportunity was given to us and my wife didn't want to go. After speaking with her it came down to moral and character reasoning. We created a plan after being homeless. It's barely working, but we are making progress. She is hurt I am willing to throw that plan out at the opportunity of a house. We argued about this she is made that last week I was so happy on how well we are doing and how in 3 years we should have enough for a home... I accepted that this was the best way in that current time.

She has put her foot down that she is not moving to Indiana unless it was a last resort her reasoning is our plan, emotional and the social world of moving. We got in a fight and I am not sure if I am being an asshole for ditching the plan we made for a plan that was given to us.

I(33M) was a cable tech when I met my wife. I made about 40-45K but worked late hours 5/6 days a week sometimes out of town and always came home tired. I wanted to get into IT so 3 years ago I took a pay cut making about 10K less to get into the corporate world and she supported me. I don’t have any degrees but she has a masters and has always made more than me even back then.
I climbed my way back in around 55K to her 60K now so we’re doing solid. I’m fact she’s underpaid at her current job, she recently got a raise and the recruiter openly told her she could offer someone outside the company 70-75 for the same role but she was capped at what she could offer due transferring internally. I wanted to make the next jump up so I decided to enroll in school. It’s a completely online school, and I only had about 3K in student loans this year. 
Now onto the issue. Me going back to school made her realize just how much she doesn’t like her job and wants to be a nurse. She initially went to med school but changed later and her masters is in an unrelated field. She currently has about 60K in student loans. She’s also had some health stuff so between that, me changing jobs, and the two kids we’ve had since getting married… moneys been tight and we’re just now getting to a place where we can start paying off debt and saving. Her going back to school would cause her to have to quit her job, and we’d take on an additional 45K in student loans. 
I really tried my best to support her decision but after finding out she would make less than 60K as an RN I just don’t think I can. I know she’s unhappy in her current role but I told her I thought it would be better to try to switch companies than to quit for a year and switch to a career t where she would make less and work worse hours, and get us deeper in debt. We’d likely have to either sell the house or move in with relatives who would have to take on responsibility of watching our kids for the time she’s in school. I feel responsibility as a father and head of household to make sure we don’t make decisions for the family that make us worse off but also I feel as if I should have supported my wife in her dream to be a nurse.

My mother lives in South America and I live in the UK. I’ve lived here for almost 15 years. I married here and had two children. When I first got pregnant, I begged my mom to come amd stay with me for a couple of weeks as I was going to give birth to my first child and her first grandchild. We’d pay for her ticket of course but she said it wasn’t her problem that I decided to have a baby on the other side of the world and she couldn’t come anyway because she had work and studies.

I sadly had a miscarriage last month and almost died from complications  (haemorrhaged severely, went into cardiac arrest and had to undergo emergency surgery to save my life). 

I was telling a friend from church about it later and how after a scary situation in life even as a grownup I still wished for a mummy cuddle. My friend called me a couple of days later and very kindly said she and her husband would like to pay for a ticket for my mom to come so we could spend the holidays together. I

 called my mom who told me her passport was expired and a new one will only be ready by mid January. Oh that kinda sucks I thought but I guess I can wait a bit more. 
But then she told me that she can only come in February after my sister’s graduation. 

At this point I became so upset. Ive lived here 15 years and not once did anyone bothered to come and visit me. Its always my husband and I paying to go and see them at least once a year. 

They’ve always had each other for events like these. My parents were there for mys sisters’ marriages, first births, when they’re ill or going through hard times. I haven’t had that and dealt with every difficult situation with only my husband for company.

I told her not to bother anymore and cancelled her ticket. Even almost dying is still not enough to get her to leave things for a while and come stay with her eldest daughter for a few weeks. I’ll spend the holidays with the only people who seem to care about me: my children and my husband.

An average work cycle is six weeks on, and three weeks off however this varies based on which mine I am sent to.  Despite the variability, I make a great salary that makes it so that my fiancée doesn't have to work full-time. As great as this is it does come without sacrifice.  There are times when I go months without seeing some people in person as I will either be working or so exhausted I can't do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what caused the predicament I am currently in with my mother. For years she and a friend's mother had wanted to do a group vacation between our families. This year they decided to follow through and formally plan the vacation.  The province they have chosen to visit is the same one where I work and planned on staying for three weeks.  As a result of this, my mother has been pressuring me into joining them. As hard as it was I had to tell her no because I didn't want to delay going home for another six weeks.  She didn't like this and for months she kept badgering/trying to guilt trip me into going.  In the end, I wound up making a compromise, since I was going to be working through the holidays.

&amp;#x200B;

 It was that I would spend three days with them before taking the next company flight home.  It however wasn't good enough for her and the badgering continued with my friend's mother joining in.  Things boiled over last week when four days before I was going to meet them I decided to scrap the compromise. After an exceptionally brutal work cycle, I was more exhausted and sorer than usual.  After thinking things through again I decided it simply wasn't worth it. I called my father and explained that I won't be meeting up with them and am going home. He understood and said he would pass the message along.  When word reached my mother all hell broke loose, I have been getting angry calls/texts since I got home.

I (20f) originally signed a lease with T (20f) and D (21m) after I transferred colleges, but for personal reasons T had to move out which I don’t blame her for. So she had to get her lease taken over asap and J (21m) took it over. D and I clean up after ourselves. J doesnt. For the past few months, D has been basically living at his girlfriends place and so J just leaves messes everywhere. I unfortunately share a bathroom with him as well. He doesn’t clean when he cooks including raw meat he puts on the counter and he doesn’t even put dishes in the dishwasher. Some of these things I’m forced to do myself. You could get really sick from some of the stuff he leaves out. I don’t even know how much time and money ive spent cleaning up his stuff. 

So, I went home for a few weeks. My parents live a few states away so I flew home but made sure everything was fine when I left. Dishes were put away, the bathroom was clean and whatever. D texts in the roommate group chat a few days before I’m set to fly back. He basically screams at us in the form of texts saying we’re so irresponsible for letting the place get this bad and it’s filthy and what not. I said I’ve been gone for a few weeks and it was clean when I left. He said this couldn’t have been made over a few weeks. I thought he was exaggerating but no. 

I came in the door and it reeked of raw meat, the floor was dirty and the couch had potato chips all over it. Dishes piled in the sink, 4 garbage bags were sitting in the corner, and the fridge smelled like something died. The drain was clogged in the bathroom and there was literal mold in the shower. Not to mention the toilet… ew. I almost threw up. I was fuming, and texted in the chat I’m not cleaning any of this because I’m not a maid and I’m tired of cleaning up after J. J says I’m overreacting and over exaggerating and that he does clean. Both of them say I should help clean bc I live there, too. I’m staying at my friends and am refusing to come home until he cleans. 

In addition to this, I was going to ask if I could move my dog here because she’s not happy without me. I didn’t want to relocate her to another state with me but she’s not happy. My parents said I really should consider taking her. But now D is saying if I can’t clean up after myself that he wouldn’t let me move my dog here even though he’s barely home and I have done most of the cleaning but J doesnt. My lease doesn’t end until August and I can’t live like this but my dog can’t continue to live without me she’s very attached and hasn’t eaten since I left. 

But now J is completely silent and not answering my texts and staying out late. D says I should just get over myself and clean it but I refuse and he’s saying I’m the AH but i think I’m in the right here.

My husband and I, recently had twins 2 months ago. I am on one year leave now (some paid some unpaid). My husband on the other hand, has had only a few days leave (which was his sick time) because we are immigrants and he has been living in this country for shorter amounts of time than me and isn’t entitled to any protected / really any leave. 

Now here is the dilemma. My MIL and SIL’s have not messaged me to check in, or even offered any help, however have demanded facetime calls every day of the babies so they can see them, or when i’ve gone for a break and it’s just my husband, decide to go over and see them and play with them.  In hindsight, this isn’t often as my husband is a medical resident so he doesn’t have much time off. And yes, I know that i am not entitled to anyone’s help, it was my choice to have children and the responsibility is mine. However, my issue is that when my SILs had babies, I went over to their homes every night to hold their babies so they could shower, prepare a hot meal from our home country for them to combat home sickness, clean their house weekly top to bottom, pay for yard matinence and take them out or arrange childcare for them to go out. 

And i guess i just expected at least some of that to be reciprocated when it was my turn.  I only have my mother and father  in this country and they live on the other side of it. I don’t regret doing anything for them, as now i know what it would be like without it. I’m not going to demand they help, or to even see me. I know that’s rash and unfair towards them. But i am hurt. 

I’m upset that unlike the the care everyone else was shown in their family i don’t get that. Im upset that I am going through this alone, away from my country, and have no one to talk to about it. I’ve spoken to my husband about how I feel, and he said that it’s unfair to expect help from them.

We decided to go out and get a video game, and on the way back, we stopped at Mcdonalds. Before going inside, I asked my cousin if he wanted anything, and he replied that he was alright and would wait in the car. 

Roger and I are waiting to order, and I make the comment to him “I really shouldn’t get him anything, he said no”, and Roger agreed. I’ll admit, it would make me uncomfortable for the two of us to eat in front of him, so perhaps selfishly I bought some little dollar menu burger. I figured if he didn’t want it, no biggie, I’d take it or he could have it later.

We get back to the car and I say something like “here man, if you change your mind” and he says *what the fuck, I said I didn’t want anything*. I give Roger a look like 🤷 (less sarcastically than that emoji) and my cousin just goes nuts, screaming that if he wanted something he would have gone in and that he could have done it himself and that I did all of this to fuck with him.

Here's the thing: he already had one wedding (a Muslim ceremony in November), I'm moving a week after his planned February service (which he is fully aware of), I have a senior dog who can't handle the confusion of packing up my entire apartment, me not being around, and then moving to an unfamiliar place, and... I was hit by a car, my leg was broken, I required surgery, and I will be using a cane -if not still using a walker - in February (and travel will be hell). My brother knows all of this. And he's still pushing it. The other factor is: my mother is planning this entire, very rushed service, because his wife (remember, they're already married in the eyes of Allah) and her entire family have COVID, and my brother is an attorney who's too busy to plan it himself. Andddddd.... Multiple members of our extended family don't want to go because it's short notice, and it will be happening during the super bowl (this is irrelevant to me, but brother is aware of the timing, and it's really pissing off quite a few family members). And again. They already had a service (which my mother attended in a different state, a day after my surgery, after I was hit by a car, because Brother said it was ""so important"" --- and at the time it was, because no one thought they were going to have a second service two months later). 

So... I'm feeling pretty upset and frankly pissed off that our mother isn't staying ""totally neutral"" (like she claims to be), and is actively planning a SECOND wedding for people who are too busy to plan it themselves and has twice now called me a ""self centered brat"" for suggesting that ""maybe they could go to city hall, and then have a service later, when timing is better for everyone.""

We live with our mom, who is divorced.
The thing thats been going on is that I can't focus on my studies, (graduating this year) I haven't been able to invite my bf over, all because of Nia's and Matt's treatment towards me or my boyfriend. When I study, I use our PC that's in my siblings room. (I have my classes, homeworks and books online or downloaded.) But for months, I wasn't able to study on weekends for more than a hour without being interrupted by Matt, Nia and my brother screaming, shouting, arguing, drinking or smoking in the back. Matt is always buying cigs, or alcohol to my siblings, which should be pretty illegal, however my mom decides to not care, because ""she argues enough with them and gets no result"". Eventually, my sister got addicted to cigarettes, throws a fit when she can't get it.
When I'm studying, I ask them to lower the volume of their music, TV, or just go outside. Their answer to this is that ""i can go someone else's house"", and ""its their room so they do what they want"". I told them that we could solve this if we moved the PC to my room, which caused my siblings to throw a fit, because they need it. I told them they can still play on it when I'm not using it, Nia argued that she also needs it to study. (She frequently skips school to stay with Matt, doesn't plan to graduate). 
I told my mom that it's impossible for me to study in these conditions, and she said I can just study in my room without the computer. I told her that my stuff is online and she didn't believe me. I also told her that she better not expect me to get into a top university and graduate perfectly, if she can't tell my sister that Matt can't come over for a FEW weekends. She called me an AH for being selfish, and not letting my sister be with Matt, and it's my fault for not studying harder and using the computer for videogames. (I play when I'm finished, or unable to keep studying).
I mentioned to her that Matt literally picks on my boyfriend everytime he comes over (calls him a f*g, comments on his looks), and that's why my boyfriend never comes over. She said it's not her problem, and if my boyfriend can't get over ""such childish comments"", then he shouldn't be in our family. 
Also, I wanted to host a Halloween party at home, but my mom refused because Nia needed to rest from school. But Nia and Matt are hosting parties every second weekend? When I argued about this, she called me selfish for not letting Nia live a calm life.
I live in a dorm on weekdays, and today my teacher approached me because I looked upset. I told her this. She said that tomorrow she'll call my mom if she won't provide me a chance to study, changes something about Matts or Nias behavior, she MIGHT contact authorities. 
I'm already scared of my mom's reaction, and I do feel like an AH here for telling an outsider about what's happening.

I work night shifts so I usually take a full shower every morning at various times, ranging from as early as 9am to as late as 12pm. I don't know if it's considered weird, but I grew up with allowing close family members use the bathroom if I was still behind the shower curtain, because I couldn't see them and they couldn't see me. It's totally normal in my family, like if my mom is showering and I have to pee, she lets me. It's not considered abnormal with us.

However, lately I've been getting annoyed because this has become a daily occurrence and while I understand we have one bathroom, I feel like she's being unreasonable. I always go tell my mom right before I take a shower that I'm going to, and sometimes she'll ask if she can pee real quick before I do, and obviously I let her, but this happens rarely. But she doesn't do this often, and usually right when I'm finishing up and rinsing my hair, or right after I turn the shower off, she'll ask to use the bathroom while I'm in there, so if she could wait just 5-10 minutes, I’d be done. I've also talked to her about this several times and told her she can pee before or after, and I don't mind it every now and then but it pisses me off when it's daily, but she never really says anything besides ""Whatever"" or ""I can't help it, we all have to share because it's the only bathroom."" Which I think is BS because 1. She doesn't have any medical issues that make her pee a lot or anything, if she did I would obviously not have a problem and 2. Again, I do share, but daily peeing while I'm showering is getting annoying.

Now every now and then I'll get a mean bone and tell her no she can't come in, I'm almost done and she can wait, she'll huff and puff but leave me alone. And I also want to clarify I'm not taking abnormally long showers or hogging the bathroom- I take 30 min showers at most, and that includes my post shower 5-10 minutes of drying off and getting dressed. Today however I snapped and didn't let her come in, she threw a fit and I told her that I don't care, she can wait, I'm literally almost done. Well when I told her no, she snapped, ""God OP, you're so fucking selfish,"" and went to her room, and didn't come out even when I said the bathroom was free and I had even cut my routine in half so I was out in 5 minutes.

I might be the AH because I don’t let her pee the second she wants to every single day when I shower, so I guess it could be selfish, but I feel like I’m being reasonable here and also deserve to have my own private bathroom/shower time uninterrupted and she can plan a little better like the rest of us do in the house.

She is the secretive type and likes to keep everything personal completely secrete (which I suppose is her prerogative). My husband already holds a fair bit of animosity towards his mom for being secretive, so he brushed this off as just another baggage item. Fine. OK. 

Me being nosey, was curious about the last name. When was she married? How long? So I got on the internet and did some record searching in that county. Well... turns out the year my husband was born, she was still married to this other man (hence her last name on the certificate). Only to be divorced that year shortly after his birth. What makes it more concerning is that 4 years later his mom filed to collect child support from this previous spouse. The man counter filed for visitation and she dropped the charges and it was left at that. 

I supplied this evidence to my husband. Of course he was upset. We agreed that no matter what, the man that had raised him was his father, and nothing would change that. We love him to death and wouldn't have it any other way. But you can understand that he was also very hurt by the fact that his mother had lied to him. And even if it's a possibility SHE herself may not know who the biological father is because of timing and the choices she made, its my opinion that my husband still has the right to know. 

The reason I believe any of this pertains to me, is because we are trying to have a family of our own. We have been struggling with infertility and I just shudder to think that we don't know if there are any predisposing health concerns on his paternal side, if his dad really isn't his biological father. And maybe that doesn't give me the right to push him to find out? He doesn't want to make waves in the family, but his mother always asks why he is so distant with her. And he just holds so much resentment for the whole situation, that it hurts to watch it continue. 

So AITA for continuing to bring it up, insisting he should try to find out what actually happened?

or WIBTA for pursuing more information on my own? Is it my place?

I live in a relatively small apartment in a wealthy neighborhood. We're talking grandiose four-floor villas with multiple bed bath and TVs per household for all my friends, while my apartment has one sizeable living/kitchen area and a small hallway that branches off into our private rooms.

I was looking for a small, intimate girl hang, and we have done basically everything else there is to do in my area. I *really* just wanted to get comfort food and cake and then sing and talk and watch a movie that I've been dying to see with my closest friends. It would have been the most comfortable atmosphere and is the first (and only) time I have asked to have people over to our apartment.

My mother knows about how everyone else's houses are so high-maintenance and is quite the clean freak, so she is embarrassed of the condition of our apartment since the smallness makes it crowded and messy. This was her first concern with having my party at home, even though I offered to help clean up.

Here is the bigger issue: when my dad comes home from work in the evenings, he likes to decompress by getting into comfortable clothes and watching soccer on the TV in the living room. This is basically the only stress-free time he ever gets since he works late 24/7, especially on the last day of the week when I am having my party. My mother says that it is a great inconvenience for me to have to force my dad to hole up in his room while I have 5-6 friends on the couch for multiple hours, even though he has stayed in his room for hours before. There is even a small television in his bedroom, and he is always welcome to come join us or walk around the house.

I have had to modify my own schedule for the convenience of my dad MANY times, and I have tried to be understanding since he is always under stress. He doesn't trust me to catch an Uber or ride home with a friend or anything, so he insists on picking me up from hangouts/events when he gets back from work which is often 3-4 hours before everyone else is leaving. I have to walk on eggshells to ask him for a favor at the right time, otherwise he will snap and say no immediately. There are many times when I have been completely free and available and willing to go places but couldn't because it would make my dad more stressed than he already is. This is practically the only time where I feel like my happiness should be prioritized over his decompression routine because it is literally my birthday - once a year!

On the other hand, I understand that I might be giving him an entire cranky weekend if I strip him of his very necessary destress time. I could just find somewhere else to do my birthday and he would not have to come home tired *and* have to sacrifice his most comfortable space, then everyone would be happy.

So... WIBTA if I push harder to have my birthday in the living room? Are my parents guilt tripping me, or am I right to want this despite how it will affect my dad?

I (67F) host all the holidays for my family, but I recently broke my arm and can't do much work to prepare. That said, my 3 kids who live nearby have been a big help to me since this happened, and offered to come and do the preparations for Christmas so that we can still have our family around for the festivities.

Some of my kids live a few hours away and their busy work schedules mean that I tend to wait to see their availability before I plan holidays so I can have everyone there - this often leads to very last-minute plans, which can be stressful. So this year, one of my nearby children (who is helping to plan) had the idea to set the date further in advance. We got whoever was available on a Zoom call to pick a date and time, and we planned all the details for the holiday weekend. Most of the family was there to weigh in, and we all decided on the date and schedule for the event, which was then sent out in a big group text.

The day after this, though, my son (who hadn't been able to join the call) replied to the text to let us know that his son and wife will be working on Christmas Eve, and so he will have to come alone and have them join later. He then called me to tell me about this and ask if there was any way we could change the date. Of course I said that we could, and the two of us decided to push the event to a different day to accommodate them. However, when I mentioned this to one of my kids planning the event, they were very upset, saying that we had all picked these dates together, there was a reason we hadn't picked the day I'd changed it to, and it wasn't fair to switch to a new day without consulting anyone when we had already made all the plans together. I'm confused, because I just want the family to be together, and don't want to leave anyone out.

I (22f) was always a good kid. Honor roll throughout all of high school, third in my class, National Honor Society… you name it I was probably doing it—and overachieving. I never gave my parents more than a hard time occasionally and over all did anything they asked of me. 
Once I got to college things started changing. My parents tried to control who I dated, what other people thought of me, things I said, even what I went to college for. 
This resulted in quite a few VERY heated arguments with my parents as I fought for my independence. My parents would say hurtful things and demean me in these arguments which resulted in no contact for a month or two at a time. 
This time was different. This was right after I had been ignored by my mom for over a month because I reached out to my bio family because I was curious about my ancestry. 
In the beginning of October my parents called me home for whatever reason. We got into an argument about something I had hid from them (I keep my life as separate as possible from my parents so they have less control). Later that night we were on our way to dinner and they asked about my grades. Sick of hiding from them I blurted out that I had failed and been dismissed from college (I had fallen into a deep depressive state and wanted to not be alive anymore) but that I had every intention to go back and pay for it myself.  
One thing lead to another and they were screaming at me about what a failure I was, how I was probably on drugs, and how I ever thought I could have a future after failing college. 
At one point I was having an anxiety attack and my mom said “this is why I think you’re on hard drugs, you’re tweaking.” At another point I refused to something my dad asked and he told me to “Get the f*ck out of my house and don’t come back, if you’re going to disrespect me” after hours of arguing and being told how big of a failure I was they gave me two options: 
Leave and don’t come back. I would be completely cut off. 
Stay home, work full time paying them back the money I owed them and once that was done be shipped off to the military branch of my choosing. 
I begged them to give me another option but they refused.  
My parents who were always supposed to support me told me that I was going to turn into a drug addict and they weren’t going to standby and watch. Mind you I’ve never done hard drugs a day in my life. They took my phone and car key so I couldn’t leave and went to bed. After long contemplation I then decided to sneak out and leave.

It sucks but it's the reality.  I knew this and probably strung him along for way too long knowing that the relationship had a time limit. 

I know that in itself makes me an asshole but I ask you to please consider the choice I would have had to make...lose 4 brothers and sisters, my parents, my share of the family businesses, etc... 

I gave him a dear John letter and though he must have tried to contact me over 1000 times in the next week and probably 2000 more over the next month (one of the reasons i realized the relationship was not as good as I thought) I never really explained to him what was going on. 

He ended up passing away about a month ago or so. I didn't know anything about it until last week. I contacted his parents to let them know how sorry I was and how I was completely shook up. His mom asked me to meet her at Starbucks to just chat and I said that was fine. 

His dad ended up showing up and they were super friendly at first but then they got pretty accusatory and I'm not good at all with high pressure situations like that. So when his dad asked me point break why I broke up with him becuase Charles was never the same after I figured i needed to tell them the truth. They basically let me get out half of what I said above and got out and walked out. His mom then sent me pages and pages of text telling me what an absolute piece of shit I am and how they will always blame me for Charles taking a turn and that I should live the rest of my life in shame and that I caused all of this. 

I'm so shook by all of this. I don't even know where to begin. I have an appointment with better help scheduled for this afternoon but I can't even sit still so I'm posting here.

I am also in college, but am attending school through the distance learning program because of autism/ADHD that I'm still learning to deal with. My father normally works from home, but is sometimes called into work. 

Anyways, my father had to go into work today because he had to do some layoffs, which I understand is stressful and emotionally draining. So I made some brownies for him and began studying for my last final exam on Tuesday. (I'm doing great in my classes btw, cumulative GPA of 3.57!!). Before he had returned, my brother and I were texting, and he said he had a doctors appointment today because there was ""a mass in his abdomen"". That's exactly what he said, and it sounded serious, so I was really worried, and my brother didn't give me any more details about it, just that they didn't know what it was. 

So my dad gets home, and I take a break from studying to say hi and see if he needs anything, and then I ask him ""how come you didn't tell me about \[brother's name\]?"" Now, I'll admit, I can be unaware of tone or attitude in my voice because of my autism, and I really struggle with social cues. However, my dad doesn't believe I have autism even though I've been diagnosed with it by two different psychiatrists because I ""don't act autistic"". So my father immediately gets really mad at me and starts yelling about attacking him. 

He then continues yelling about how there wasn't a mass in his abdomen and by saying that I was blowing it out of proportion and making it sound horrific, when in reality, my brother couldn't feel the mass himself, it wasn't found by his primary care doctor but by another doctor he had never seen before at the University wellness center, and that he hadn't even had the ultrasound yet so it was no big deal. 

I apologized to him, but explain that I was just going off of the information I had at the time from my brother. I went on to try and say that I really didn't mean to attack him, (I honestly hadn't realized there was tone in my voice) and that I was just worried about my brother. 

By this point, I was crying and apologizing, but my father continued yelling at me about how immature I was and how I only think about myself and not him because he had a stressful day and I just come and attack him when he gets home until my brother called him. 

I understand how what I said sounds accusatory, but I was really worried about my brother based on the information I had at time.

The books are totally unrelated to what I post about, but when my dad heard about the followers I had, he asked me to make a post about their books to recommend to my followers. He said they might not be interested, but have relatives or friends who would fit the book's market better and they would spread it via word of mouth. He even asked if I could message each follower one-by-one about their books, but I quickly said no to that.

I've done this before in the past, when he wanted me to post about their an off-shoot business venture they were doing a year back on my film review blog, and I did. I got one or two comments that said good luck, but the post overall did very poorly. I just feel the same thing is going to happen this time around, and I'm thinking of making some merch for my Tumblr blog and creating an Etsy business too, so I don't want to dilute my content before I even start.

So I said no, I don't think that's a good idea. My dad took it on the chin, but about a week later he was mad at something else I did, and mentioned I'm ""short-sighted"" because I can't even give a simple shout out on a blog to support my family. 

I guess it's not a big deal and a shout out won't hurt, but I don't know.

We met through my mom who also works at the same place (but different department). Mom absolutely loves her.

I have two other siblings, a younger sister (19F) and an older brother (28M) who is a low functioning autistic. Brother is permanently under my mom's care and my sister was home for the break. I wanted to introduce my gf to them because it feels serious now that we are talking about moving in together.

gf also has a cat (3F) that I don't really mind. She keeps her distance from me usually even when I spend the weekend at her apartment. Also I dog sit for my neighbours sometimes so maybe she doesn't like the smell- and I'm a dog person.

Last Sunday we (my gf and both my siblings) met up at my apartment. Mom was busy and already knows her. Also, my gf knew that my brother needed care. 

My sister loves cats but couldn't have one first because of mom's allergies then because of her campus rules so she asked her to bring the cat along. She got there early and the three of them got along well. 

Then my mom dropped my brother who, having lived with my mom his whole life, didn't know much about cats. He was curious so he played with her a little, touched her ears and held her collar and the cat was not liking it. We told him to stop but he didn't till she clawed him and ran away to hide. It wasn't serious, she had did that to me too once or twice in the beginning and I gave him some first aid while they comforted the cat.

Everything was ok for a while, we ate dinner and I could tell my gf was uncomfortable with how my brother was eating and talking.  After dinner we talked some more with football on. At some point my brother wandered off. A while later my gf heard a faint wail and rushed, my brother was trying to hush her off the railing with a broom. The cat was 'rescued' and my sister yelled at him and I defended him saying she would have fallen 10 ft to the fire-exit.

My gf got upset and left because he didn't apologise, my sister and mother seem to take her side and told me to apologise for calling her unreasonable for leaving as they just lover her and her cat.

She hasn't talked to me in a week and I genuinely don't know.

We had been hanging out often outside work and become quite close, so I really wanted to help them out. When interviewing for the job they claimed to have a lot of knowledge and skills which fit well at our workplace, but after starting it became pretty obvious that they didn't actually have any of these skills. They are in a mid level position, so there are pretty high expectations about performance. I spent a lot of time at work helping them get up to scratch but now almost 8 months later they are still working at about half the pace of the rest of us. They are constantly complaining and stressing over their workload and pulling very long days to achieve what everyone else achieves within normal working hours. Every time something small goes wrong they blow up and act like it's a huge crisis and their life is ruined and then work even less efficiently. So it's something of a viscous cycle. When other coworkers try to help them out, they have also been blowing up any time these coworkers make mistakes, which are usually really minor. I have been trying to cheer them up and telling them to stress less over minor things going wrong, because this happens to everyone. But they just seem to get angry at me for not being sympathetic enough to their struggles. Honestly though, I have been picking up so much slack on their behalf since they started, I just don't have the energy to also be sinking into this negative thinking in an otherwise very productive and positive workplace. So I've started distancing myself from them, but I feel guilty and I think they are getting more and more angry at me these days.

I asked her if she didn't see that one of my due dates was very similar to my cousin's and that I feel like I'm getting stabbed every time I see a picture of a baby the same age as mine should have. She reacted by telling me that I didn't have to think about it so much and that my cousin's daughter was not to blame for my miscarriages. What hurt me the most was when she told me that she had never asked me to have grandchildrens and that she had enough with my cousin's children. The conversation escalated to the point where my father jumped in and said he had completely lost his mind. He began to tell us things that my sister and I didnt know. My cousin has been living in a house owned by my parents for 3.5 years. My mother lowered her rent a few months before giving birth to her son at half the agreed price. She promised my dad that she would ask for the full rent in a few months, but it's been 3 years and all she's done is lower it even more. Now my mother says it is not fair that we have access to her inheritance in a few years and that my cousin cannot benefit a little from her wealth, since we do not have children at the moment. At that moment I took my things and left. My mother hasn't contacted me again, but my father says he won't talk to me again if I don't apologize. AITA?

Since having our baby I've really struggled with making food yet husband still refuses to cook as he says he doesn't know how to and will end up getting take out instead. 

I'm also really struggling with post partum depression which he hasn't really acknowledged and I have been struggling to access help for it. He doesn't wake up for any of the night feeds and he helps out with the baby foe an hour a day if I'm lucky.

I (34M) constantly have arguments with my wife (37F) whenever I stay overnight anywhere that isn't our house.

The situation:

* I work a few cities over and have to commute over an hour to get to work in the UK.

* I am leaving my current job soon and would like to attend the last office night out because it'd be a nice way to spend the last few days working somewhere I genuinely have enjoyed working with people I actually like working with.

* Because it's far away and in a remote location, it made sense to me to get a hotel and stay overnight nearby instead of paying the same amount for a taxi home and/or run the risk of having trouble getting a taxi when I feel like it without prebooking.

She doesn't like the idea of me staying in a hotel for a night out.  When I ask her why, she just says ""I just don't like it when you don't come home"".

This makes me frustrated.  It's an office night out and it makes logistical sense.  Since she doesn't like it I say, ""then it's fine - I won't go"" and she says this makes her guilty.  I meet her halfway and say, ""Okay, then how about I pay whatever it costs for the taxi?"" - she still isn't happy.  So, at this point, she isn't happy if I go, she isn't happy if I stay, and she isn't happy if I come home by taxi.

This happens anytime I stay anywhere.  I practically need to broadcast my location if I stay away from home for a few days if I need to be in London.

I feel like I'm going insane.

I am apart of a large friend group which my gf is also apart of, a while ago everyone arranged to take a large trip (same country just rent out a large house that is surrounded by woods and has a lake).  


Recently one of my cats, Kitty1 (to respect her privacy) has not been feeling well, she hasn't been eating and has been crying when I pick her up, I took her to the vets and everything was fine and they said it could be constipation as the blood test was fine. I was given medication to make her hungry and also this liquid for constipation relief, this whole thing has been very stressful for me as my cats (and tortoises) are my life

I do not work a 9 - 5 and live alone so apart from the morning errands I have to do I have been mostly tending to her, (she has not been moving much but she's been drinking a lot of water and has been eating a little, mainly more liquid based foods and cat soups)

&amp;#x200B;

Well the trip is coming up (meant to leave this Friday) and normally I'd get someone I trust to pop in and feed my cats and give them a little bit of attention (Tortoises are outside hibernating) but I really don't want to leave my cats, mainly because normally I get my neighbour to feed them but that is simply just putting some food down and playing with them but with this medicine she does not like it so I have to force her to take it which she is fine after but I could not except that of my neighbour, she is too kind but it's too much to ask and I don't want to leave her with any temporary shelters she's already had to stay overnight at the vets and she hated it, she deserves to be at home.  


I decided to back out of the trip and everyone is upset with it, In my defense it's not affecting anyone (I have already paid my share of the rent for the house and drinks/food and I would not ask for that back so it's not a money issue and my friend group is not all couples so it's not that my gf would be uncomfortable going without me, she has more friends in this group than I do.) but everyone is saying that it will be good for all of us to be able to hang out for a long period of time and that I don't leave the house enough.  


If I am being honest I am very positive about Kitty1's recovery, she is making good progress but still I do not want to leave her alone, or any of my pets for that matter (might sound sad but while I do like my friends I enjoy being alone.)

We only became close just before lockdown when the friend group we were in became quite toxic so we both decided to leave and have been quite close ever since. 

6 months ago my mam and I moved out of our hometown to a different town about an hour away. That combined with Amy starting college has meant that we don’t see each other that often. 

Amy and our other friend Nicole (18f) (name also changed) have a month off for Christmas so it was the perfect opportunity for us to meet up. 
I suggested that we have a sleepover at my house on New Years as they haven’t seen the new house yet and I thought that it would be fun to welcome in the New Year together. I texted both of them about two weeks ago, Nicole replied straight away and said that she’s love to, and Amy only replied about 4 days ago and said that she’s pretty sure that she can make it. 

Fast forward to about half an hour ago and I see that I got a text from Amy saying that she was throwing a party on NYE and asked if I wanted to come, and that was the straw that broke the camels back. 

See, for the last year or so there have been various things that made me question how much Amy actually likes me; she’d always be busy when myself or Nicole try to make plans, and the odd time she is available she would show up 30 mins - 2 hours late or just cancel last minute, she’s take anywhere from 1 week to one month to a respond to my texts (I don’t mind if it takes a few days to respond. I understand that college is stressful and time consuming and that she has other things she has to do, but a week or more just feels like it’s deliberately ignoring the texts), and would often ignore me if her other friends were around. And things have only gotten worse since I moved away. I just repeatedly feel disrespected by her but I always thought that I was just being paranoid as I’ve had some shitty experiences with friends in the past that have made it hard for me to believe that people actually like me.
(By the way, I’ve never brought up these issues with her before because I’m extremely non confrontational)

Anyway, not only am I pretty devastated that she decided to schedule a party on the day of our planned sleepover, it’s also pissing me off that she’s decided to have a party of all things, since she knows I hate parties; I’m an introvert with social anxiety, shitty people skills, trust issues as mentioned before, and a severe detestation of alcohol due to my alcoholic father fucking up and continuing to fuck up my life and my family’s lives. Plus the fact that I live an hour away, I can’t drive, trains don’t run to my town that late, and I don’t want to be keeping my mum up all night since she has to look after my nana the following day.

Before the wedding SIL was said her mum wants to make the kids clothes, my niece and nephew, for my wedding. I said that's lovely but not required I am happy to buy something for them. She decides to make the clothes though and I still offer to pay but not heard anything. I only see SILs mum when I collect my nephew from her house once a week and have quick general chit chat. Very sadly my husband's cousin passed away a few days before the wedding, I let my family know so they are aware of the situation in case any change of wedding plans etc. 

We were getting married on Monday and on the Friday before SILs mum texts and says can she come to the wedding ceremony to see the kids go down the aisle, no expectations but she would really appreciate it. To be honest it was a bit last minute and we had a max number of guests at the venue so I said really sorry but that won't be possible but I'll do a nice album for her of the kids. Her response is SIL told her husband's cousin had died and thought there would be room. I couldn't believe she said that really and husband wasn't happy so I said that is the case but it would be very insensitive to replace him, hoping that would be the end of the conversation. She replies to say she will just sit outside the venue in her car. I just left it after that thinking surely she wouldn't. 

On the Saturday SIL texts and says as they are giving my brother a lift in the car with them her mum will have to drive the clothes to the venue. Again I'm thinking are you serious you can put them in a bag in someone's lap. Not wanting to be stressing about this two days before my wedding I called my dad to let him know what was happening. I didn't realise but he called her after and said she's not welcome do not attend. Cue the wedding day and SIL is in a foul mood and doesn't talk to me, her mum doesn't show up but has let everyone know I am 'evil' and have really upset her and I could have talked to her about it. I am banned from her house so now someone else has to be there to pass my nephew over at the door. I received an invoice for the children's clothes which obviously I was happy to pay. But AITA?

I guess I don't understand. So for the past 4 years my fiance has been saying things like ""you need to be more independent and stop relying on me so much""- but the only thing I ever relied on him for was a ride to and from work because I was terrified of driving. Everything else I did on my own and never asked him for anything. I drive now so literally I don't ask him for anything, ever.

But like.. here's the issue.. my fiance is extremely forgetful himself. He can't even run to the store for dinner supplies unless he calls me when he is there, even if I write him a list. After he's done shopping, he has me come down to the car with a bag for the groceries because he never remembers to bring one and then I end up taking up at least half the groceries, even if it's two bags he can carry himself (I never ask for help carrying groceries when I go shopping, literally never). If the trash needs to be taken out, he wants me to help him; even if he hasn't helped me take in down in weeks. If he decides he is in a cleaning mood, he immediately asks me to help him, as if I hadn't just cleaned the house by myself for weeks on end. If he needs to make a dump runs, he wants me to go too. If he needs to bring in bottles to the redemption, he asks that I get them all ready and go with him. If he makes dinner, it's a ""babe you wanna help me? We can do it together."" If he brings his dog out (usually I do), he asks if I want to go with him, damn near everytime, despite me constantly bringing the dog out myself and wanting a break. It's just incredibly exhausting because I feel like I'm constantly ""helping"" or doing everything myself, all while hearing the ""you need to be more independent and stop relying on me"" comments. 

So I'm extra salty today. I'm not going to deny it. I've been sick for over a week and I'm just tired. I'm tired of literally doing jack all and I want to sleep. I text him and tell him I'm taking a nap and he immediately starts in with ""well I'm getting out of work early so we can go grocery shopping together so I'm going to be home at 1:45"". Leaving me no time to nap at all. So I got an attitude because why do I even need to go in the first place? Especially where he knows I'm tired.

Living with my husband and child in the city where his family lives. I have no social connection anymore because of, well, maybe because all of my friends(four of them) have their own family of their own now too, which is normal.
Recently, my husband ask me for my permission to (after office hours)be with his officemates(guys only) which being me doesn’t really bothered and let him be.
Hours went by, he messaged me that he can’t drive home because his drunk because he went to another event with friends(drunk guys and girls)and not the event he asked permission to go to. He never told me. He went home the next morning.

This is his first time doing this so I’m really pissed. All night that night I am texting him, asking where he was. If he’s okay, etc.
This is the night before my birthday and we have plans with our child (details not important etc.)
He’s saying sorry verbally, and I’m not feeling that he’s really sorry.
The whole birthday celebration, I celebrated with him and being my child is still a toddler I just let it slipped and enjoyed my baby enjoying himself(baby boy).
After a few days, I really am feeling not right, so for the first time I checked his phone. Being we both know the passcode of each of our phones, I thought maybe there’s no issue.

I found out that my husband(32)-whom I trust and love with all my being, have another “persona” of chatting/sending, with his office friends enjoying himself sending pictures and updates on his other friend group chat, his drunk celebration with girls and guys, while me that same night and that very same time is with my child worrying where he was, asking for an update.

I feel shattered that he made me feel that way. And I don’t know what to do.
He broke me and I feel no other term but shattered. That I am considering to break the marriage. It’s been months and I still am broken. And I cannot move on because is it as if I am the one trying to fix the feeling I’m feeling. I’m the only one affected. I can’t talk to anyone because I don’t know who I can talk to.
The guy I always knew for almost 10 years is not the guy I know.

AITA for checking his phone, and doesn’t trust him anymore after finding out what he’s doing behind my back while I’m worried sick.
He’s not cheating but girls around him are flirty and I don’t trust them.
Should I just not check his phone anymore.
But If I don’t, what if I found out this another persona of him doing shitty things like what he did. How will I know he won’t do this again.
