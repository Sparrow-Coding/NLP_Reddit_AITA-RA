My mom asks me if I'm going to get something for him, but it's more of the you're-buying-it-tone and not an actual question. He only likes cake pops, but they're 4 bucks, and I don't want to pay for his all the time. I pay with my card with my own money.

It's so annoying to have to spend it and no one ever pays me back. They don't say they will, but my mom argues it ""builds the relationship between us."" My brother never gives me anything, he doesn't have any money, so he doesn't buy anything for himself or anyone.

The other day I had enough loyalty points to buy a free drink. So we went in the drive through line and he demanded to know why my mom didn't say his order. She then asked if I had enough for him too. I said I don't and my brother started throwing a fit.

Last week his little sister(F20) got engaged so I planned a celebration dinner for their family to see them and express their happiness for them. When no one on his side even blinked when we got engaged or said congratulations I wanted to do something so she felt special. 

At dinner it came up they are planning a destination wedding 1 month after our wedding.  

Of course my fiancé wants to be there for his sister but financially that's a lot right after our wedding that we are already budgeting for. 
We're looking at solutions to this but my fiancé suggested we post pone our wedding until after theirs so we can resave. His reasoning for this is that he doesn't want me to give up aspects for our wedding so that we can afford to go to theirs. While this has good intentions I selfishly don't want to wait any longer to be his wife. I also don't want be over 30 by the time we get married. I already have my dress, our decor and our venue.

He suggested we could elope and have a reception later but it feels like I'm getting the short end of the stick.

Would jt be incredibly rude to ask that they wait a few months as it's mostly a trip anyways? Who wouldn't want to go to Cuba in the winter?!

My fiancé is very upset saying that we can't afford both, I don't want him to miss his sisters wedding or feel like I'm asking him to pick me over her but I don't want to wait 3+ years fie our wedding to accommodate theirs. AITA?",,

Without fail no matter what gift I get for her she always has something negative to say about it and her disapproval. For example one year I got her this huge hickory farms tea and cheese spread and she complained that she had teas and doesn’t want to try new cheeses. I got her a gift card for the bookstore as I know she enjoys reading. I tried to ask what books she likes but she wouldn’t tell me and my mom didn’t know. The gift card was shoved back in the Christmas card and she talked about it being a lazy gift. I got her a dog staircase for her to use for her dogs as they are aging and can’t jump on and off her bed anymore and she used to talk about how she always had to get up in the night to assist them. She got mad that I only got something for the dogs. I am not made of money but this was not an inexpensive gift. I usually try to spend at least 150 dollars on her every year even though I’m struggling. I’ve made her gifts, bought gifts from craft shows and still not even a simple thank you. 

Last year I’d finally had enough. I bought her a jewelry box and a necklace wrapped inside of it and a brooch (she’s always wearing brooches) as her previous box broke from her dropping it. As soon as she opened the gift and saw the jewelry box she scoffed and said that she has 2 jewelry boxes already. I snapped. I told her if she gave me ideas then I could get her what she wanted. I’ve always been the person to try to please everyone and yet I can’t seem to get her approval on anything. On top of this she either forgets to get me or my partner anything or she says she will get to it later but never does. It’s not about the gifts for me but I’m so turned off by her attitude that I no longer want to worry about getting her anything.

My partner has agreed as he sees the way my grandmother talks to me. He’s already asked if we are done trying to please her, but as much as I want to agree with him my mother believes I have to keep trying. My mother has told me that if I don’t then I might as well not show myself at Christmas going forward. My mother has Christmas at her house every year. Please help I really don’t know what to do.

Is wasn't intimate but she was kind of holding onto his chest with his arm around her back.

While I was there. very uncomfortable. besides the cheating part he is desperate to see her again and her mom won't let her come over unless I am there as another female. But because of what happened I a don't want to be ""used"" just so he can see her and b I don't want they doing this things while I am around. but he constantly mentions her and if I don't go they most likely won't get to see each other.

One gets Thanksgiving, the other gets Christmas and it switches the following year. Last year was Thanksgiving at my family's house and Christmas was supposed to be spent at DH's family's. We didn't spend the actual holiday with his family because his SIL was having a hard last two months of her pregnancy so my in-laws went to help my BIL and his wife a month earlier than they were supposed to. DH wanted to spend Christmas with just us since his parents were out of state but I thought we should go see my family instead since our original plan didn't work out. He eventually agreed.

This year Thanksgiving was meant to be at his family's home. The problem popped up when I found out my parents invited my best friend and her father over to their place for the holiday. She moved back to our hometown recently to care for her father and I haven't seen her in person in almost 3 years. I wanted to see her and suggested we switch up our plan. My husband was against this since we spent both holidays with my family last year and suggested we could go to my family's the day after. His other reason is that we drive to see my parents at least once a month and since she moved back, I could see her whenever I'm there now. I feel like the Christmas thing wasn't fair to say because it wasn't on purpose, it just played out that way due to circumstances. I suggested that either we both go to his family's for the weekend, or he should go ahead and I'd join him this weekend and we'd see his family for Christmas this year. By Wednesday afternoon we hadn't reached a solution so I left to go to my family and see my friend.

Soon as I got there my family was asking me where DH was and I explained the situation. All was fine until after dinner mom pulled me aside and told me she thinks I was being a bad wife. I think that's a pretty archaic view, spouses don't need to be attached at the hip. My friend agreed with me. My plan was still to drive to my husband's family today and when I told him I was getting ready to start heading that way, he told me not to bother because he was heading home this afternoon. This started an argument that my parents overheard and they told me I shouldn't act surprised because I left before we had agreed on a way to resolve the issue. Now I'm waiting for him to get home. I don't think I did anything wrong but my parents are usually pretty reasonable so now I'm wondering if AITA in this instance.",,

I want us to have at least a similar schedule, but if I go to sleep and expect him to come to bed in a couple of hours he won't he just stays up until I wake up and then goes to sleep. It is really annoying because we share a room in the house we live in.

It's not like he would never be able to talk to his friends during normal hours as they are awake during normal hours, just for less time. 

It's like he actively tries to avoid sleeping. It's been affecting my work badly recently and my mental health.

I have a question, I'm not sure if what I'm doing is right, can you guys help me? I'm sorry, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for my question. 

I genuinly suck as a person. I make a lot of mistakes and am also manipulative, selfish, self-centered and I have many more bad qualities. My friends are amazing, they deserve so much better. I have become an awful person and my friends are suffering because of it. My mood changes fast too so I sometimes get irritable and grumpy and I am just not good company. I also suck socially and I feel so awkward not knowing what to say and stuff, this makes my friends feel awkward too. 

It's much better for my friends to get other friends and not be friends with me anymore. I have been isolating because of this and trying to not reach out to them first anymore and only send something when my friends reach out to me first.

My friends have no idea why I'm doing this and i realized I'm hurting them by not telling them and just not reaching out anymore. I'm not sure why but I'm kind of afraid of also telling them.
I'm also not there for them anymore and I usually don't send a message to check up on them anymore too. I know this is really bad and that I'm hurting them with this too. 
I do this because I suck at listening and helping my friends when they're down, I probably only make things worse. 
I know it doesn't make sense and that it's really selfish, and part of me also probably wants to do this because it'll be ""easier"" for me too to not have social interaction and the worries and guilty that it gives me.
 
My brain kind of also twists this into more evidence for why I'm a bad person and why it's better to just isolate, even though it might hurt my friends too. 

Ahh I'm really sorry, it's hard to make sense of my thoughts, this post is a mess and it really doesn't make much sense. 
I guess what I'm trying to say is if I should stop having friends to make sure my friends don't get hurt by me anymore now, or in the future if I get worse, even though I might hurt them by doing so. Or should I not because I might hurt them this way? ",,

Turns out I could not. I fell and landed on my elbow. My SIL came out and immediately helped me and I assured her that this was my own ego that got me hurt, and she and Connor were not to blame (she thought he’d goaded me into it).

I was finally given the green light to start PT last week. The person I’m seeing is a student, but the person supervising her, “Anna,” turned out to be Adam’s mother. Small world! I hadn’t met her on Halloween night because Adam’s dad dropped him off and came back to get him while she stayed home with their younger kids. We talked about the kids and it was a nice connection to make.

My SIL is not listed as someone they can reveal any information to.

I want to file a HIPAA complaint so that this is looked into because I don’t want this to happen to anyone else and I want better training at this place going forward. I don’t want an apology or anything like that because it honestly won’t make any difference for me.

We're not  super close but I would say that we're friends. A few weeks ago she asked if she could use my facial soap and I said yes, thinking that it was a one time thing. 

I have a habit of doing a ""spa day"" or sorts when a long weekend comes around. Basically I take a longer shower, exfoliate, etc. after class I began gathering my stuff to bring to the shower and I noticed that my last bar of facial soap was gone. I thought I just misplaced it so I was rummaging through my side of the room when my rooms walked in. She asked what I was doing and I vaguely explained which is when she reached into her wet shower bag and pulled out a bar of my soap. 

It was disgusting , soft, and wet, the way bar soap gets when it's left stewing in water. She said that she took it when I said she could use my soap. The thing is I wouldn't have even been mad if she just told me she took it, so I could order more in time. (I order from a small business near where I grew up in a different state).

Because the bar she took was basically ruined, I asked if she would give me a few dollars for the next order and I could even add extra if she wanted a supply. She refused because I said she could take it and I blew up at her about the soap and demanding that she paid in part for the next order for taking my stuff.

Now we aren't talking and I'm starting to think I should have just let it go. So AITA?

We happened to run into my ex (Willow, f33) who was eating lunch at the same place and I suggested we eat together. Willow said she was almost done and will be leaving soon anyway but I figured it was all good, at least we won’t have to wait for a table.

Willow and Emma only met briefly when I was with Willow. Emma didn’t like her much but was always polite, Willow never cared about Emma. 

The thing about Willow is that she’s not originally from here, she moved here to do her PhD so she has a slight accent. I mean, she speak perfect English except for her accent. Which is kind of a given considering it’s her 3rd language.

When we were waiting on our food, Willow was kind of rude, ignoring us, eating her food and being on her phone. I tried to start small talk. Willow replied briefly and it caused Emma to make a joke about Willows accent. Willow looked at her and said “and look who’s talking” (Emma has a strong local accent).

When Willow left, Emma started complaining about Willow, how she always pretends to be miss perfect but Emma won me and Willow doesn’t even begin to compare.  This didn’t sit right with me so I told her that I loved her but there’s a lot she could learn from Willow and she’s not half the woman that Willow is. 

This cause Emma to go ballistic and she started crying, which happens a lot most likely due to pregnancy hormones, and screaming at me. I’ve no idea what she said but I asked her to not make a scene. She wouldn’t stop so we had to leave the restaurant without eating.

She’s furious with me, saying I’m the asshole but after what Emma said about Willow, I thought she needed a reality check. I love her to bits but she’s not all that.

She complained to my sister and my sister called me telling me I was the asshole. Am I really though? Aita?",,

Me: Me (obv) (29f)
Best friend: Chloe (29f)
Best friend’s fiancé: Hank (34m)
Godson: James (4m)

So, I am a godparent to James, who’s mom Chloe is one of my best friends. They live together with Hank, who has been a stay at home step-dad since April 2022 (when they moved into their new house).

For some background, Hank had gone on medical leave when they moved in - his mental health was deteriorating, so they decided to have him just be a SAHD instead of trying to be step-dad AND full time worker at a job that was causing him a lot of stress. He’s been getting paid medical leave since April for about $4k/mo, which was only a minor hit to his income. 

Chloe does work, but makes only about $1800/mo based on 3-4 days a week at 13 hour work days. 

Because of reasons I’m not going to explain, when they got the new house the mortgage was opened under only Hank’s name, so he was the one that set up their online account and was the only one who had access. He’s also the only one who gets the mail usually since he’s home every day and Chloe works extra long hours for half the week. 

I got a call from her last night extremely upset, saying she just found out that their house is in foreclosure because a solicitor showed up at their front door asking if they were interested in a buy-out due to the foreclosure status. 

She became (understandably) pretty angry and demanded to see the mortgage statements. It turns out that he hasn’t been paying their mortgage since June (2 months after moving in), and they’re about $10k in debt. 

He started blaming her, saying she’s the one that’s spent all of his income and that’s why he hasn’t paid their mortgage for almost 6 months. He also said she was overreacting as he has $10k left in his 401k to cover it, but he’s waiting to pay it until they give him a deal on the balance to bring it back out of foreclosure. 

I’m personally pretty offended because over the last couple of months, Chloe has called every couple of weeks asking for money, saying Hank just paid the mortgage so they didn’t have food or toiletries for the baby. Of course I’ve lent them any money I could spare, but my own expenses have doubled since June, and I frequently have less than $20 in my checking account. 

I asked her why she told me they had paid the mortgage and needed money, to which she said that is what she was told and believed him. 

Now he is officially done receiving medical leave payments, so the only income they have is from her $1800/mo paychecks, and he has no plans on going back to work because he’s still struggling mentally. 

I feel lied to and betrayed by Hank, who I thought was a great step-dad to my godson and a friend, and Chloe is doubly upset because she has been lied to and unwittingly has lied to me. 

I don’t want to give them any more money that I already don’t have, but now I feel like James’s needs are going to be in jeopardy if I tell her no, which would make me feel like a HUGE AH.",,

I (23F) currently live in a different city and state from my parents and left their home when I was 18. I knew I had to get away for my own mental health and haven't regretted that decision once. My relationship with my parents has gotten better, but that is because I now only see them about 4-5 times per year and I keep many aspects of my life separate from them (they don't know about my relationship status, religious beliefs, sexual identity, and other aspects of my life.) I also don't have them on any of my social media accounts, which has caused issues with my mom before. My mom has also previously asked for me to share my location with her, which I refuse to do. These boundaries have helped me maintain a relationship with them which I do often enjoy and I benefit from some financial support they provide me (as I am currently in graduate school), thought I plan to become financially independent as soon as possible. I have also been in therapy for 5 years working on establish these boundaries. 

My parents moved when I was in college and now live in a town where I know no one else besides them and my sister. My sister and her husband are planning to spend New Years with my parents, and I am expected to as well. My family didn't really celebrate Christmas growing up so New Years was frequently the holiday to ""be with family"". I am planning to take time off my job to visit them for a week around that time, but my plan was to come back on the 30th for a concert and then celebrate New Years with my friends and bf. My parents had offered to get my plane ticket using their points and they are really upset that I want to come back before New Years. They have been trying to guilt me into staying and my mom has said things like ""I don't understand why you hate us so much"", I guess we are terrible parents"" and ""let's see how you go a few months without our (financial) help"". I feel guilty about it but I really would rather spend time with my circle of people who are accepting of me, not manipulative, share common interests etc than sit at home with my family.

This year we decided not to do the whole big thanksgiving thing and instead opted to have an edible, some crappy bad-for-us snacks, soda and watch movies instead. 

So the night before Thanksgiving we went to the store and got our snacks and drinks. I bought myself and my boyfriend a 2 liter bottle of Dr. Pepper and Root beer. I bought my sister a 6 pack of diet coke (bottles) because she doesn't like drinking from 2 liters because they go flat. Wednesday night my boyfriend stayed over we did Thanksgiving part 1 with all three of us. My bf and I killed the Dr. Pepper Wednesday night and my sister had some of her coke. 

Thursday my BF left to go see his family for the day. My sister and I had our edibles and hung out. Well, the edibles hit really hard. We were both super high. At some point my sister had run out of diet coke. She wanted to drive to the store to buy more, and I freaked out because I was worried she would get into an accident or get arrested for a DUI and lose her job over it (I was very high and having vivid flashes of all those things happening for reference). I told my sister she could have my root beer, but she said ""Nahh. I'm not really a root beer person""

I ended up crying because I was so freaked out about her driving so my sister didn't go and went to her room instead. I was low key freaking out about how I was ruining thanksgiving so I decided to walk to the store and buy her some diet coke. 

The store is about 2 miles so it wasn't too bad walking there, but it was pretty cold out and I was dry mouthed because of the edible so when I got there I got myself a gatorade and I bought my sister a bottle of coke. 

When I got home I told her I walked to the store and got her a coke. She said I was crazy and said thank you. Then she looked in the bag and got upset and said ""You only bought ONE?"" 

I was still very high and just burst into tears again. So I went to my room and called my boyfriend. He came back over after he was done at his family's and he, my sister and I had more snacks and watched movies. My sister thanked me again for the coke, and asked if she could still have some of my root beer. I told her yes, and I put the root beer on the table with all the snacks. 

Well I started to have fun and was enjoying the food, movies and the later half of my edible. At some point I ended up killing off the root beer. I know I had drunk a lot of it, but it had been out for a while. Well a little after I finished it, my sister went to go get some. She asked where it was and I said ""Oh, I finished it a few mins ago"". Then my sister got upset and said that it wasn't right that I said I would share it with her and then didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

As such, I decided to take my own airline to accumulate the miles and stick with the one airline, although the negatives to this would be that it will have a very long layover (which I am ok with as I would like to explore the layover city for a bit on my own). I also wanted to use this flight as a way to test traveling on my own as I will eventually have to do so internationally for a school project. I have never done so and so I thought this would be like a mini practice. I used to have horrible anxiety traveling but am doing better, so I figure this would be a cool next step.

Anyway, they booked their flight and I booked mine. Then they tell me that we have to move the date to the following month. Apparently our return date falls on the superbowl and he cant get off that date despite not even trying to ask first.

Their flight stayed the same except they have to also purchase a seat for their child as it is older by then.

Anyway, I called my airline and they were able to give me credit back for the entire flight including the nonrefundable voucher! Thing is, I now cant go on their airline even if I wanted to despite it being cheaper because I have that flight credit. But now I see online some people think I am a bad friend for wanting to take a separate airline. (I deleted the post).

She flew to her home in Sacramento before I left for Michigan and I had her car. I left her car at the most convenient place at the airport for her, and she was all scared about me leaving the keys in a hidden spot under the car, so i said i would leave them with the valet service. But for some fucked reason that service was shut down during my flight and i felt bad about leaving them under her car. So i kept them and paid 100$ to get it Fedexed next day to her house where she was for thanksgiving. Lying and saying they’re at the valet in order to not ruin her thanksgiving with worry.

They arrived when she was already asleep so she just had to grab the package before she left for the airport. I stressed how important it was that she got the package but didn’t tell her it was her keys again so she wasn’t worrying all thanksgiving and night because she would worry like crazy. This morning she wakes up to all the confirmation delivery texts and screenshots i sent her, even a picture of her house taken by the delivery driver.

I really just kept saying she needed to get it and it was important, I should have let her wake up to a text that said it was the keys but I thought she would still understand it was important and open it to find the keys anyways. But so apparently the driver either put it in the neighbors mailbox or the neighbors front door and she just left it because of that and now she’s on a plane and doesn’t know how screwed she is.

“Omg babe I think that’s the neighbors house” and just left it…

I can’t believe she didn’t grab it and I’m calling her stupid over and over in my head. 

She’s on the plane as I post this will land in about 30 minutes. I woke up to her texts and she was already in the air.

We bring sleepout portable shades with us when we travel (originally bought for baby, now also have them behind our regular curtains at home all the time because we sleep so much better too) and it helps SO MUCH to make morning sleep last longer. 

So we’re on a thanksgiving trip with another family, “big kids” (4-6) sharing a room. We arrive, other family gets set up first, then I go in and install one of our blackout shades on the window to make the room dark enough for my kiddo, who is also light sensitive, to sleep. 

Later, other mom goes to get something from the kids room and comes back ANGRY that I am imposing my parenting style. She says she would NEVER use blackout curtains in a room where her child will be sleeping. Apparently her kids would get used to it being so dark, their “sleep resilience” would be ruined, and they’d never be able to go on trips or have sleepovers without being “seriously high maintenance” for the rest of their lives. Which, ok I guess, but even if they’re like my SO it takes 30 seconds to set up and that’s way more chill than many other bedtime routines…

I am usually very conscious of respecting other people’s parenting choices, but this was so intense. Did I miss something here? AITA?",,

We have a decent relationship. I'm financially independent and I finally got my own apartment. I've made trips back home to my parents and sibling a few times a year, and though it's an 8hr drive each way it's cheaper than flying. My family has yet to make a trip to visit me in my new home.

This past summer, my grandparents decided to plan a huge Christmas with all of our extended family. My parents were invited and from their response it seemed they'd be in attendance, but only for 3-4 days. In Aug., my grandparents and uncle rented out two cabins where everyone could stay for the holidays together. This rental included space for my family &amp; myself.

Sidenote: After Christmas, Im going on a 2-week vacation with my bf and his family, and everyone is aware that after the 27th I would be out of town. I saved money for this.

Everything went to shit when my parents changed plans. Not only did neither of them request time off work for Christmas, but apparently they only intended to come see me, not our extended family. It was very clear in our conversations that they were only communicating this change to me and consistently put 'the decision' on what to do on my shoulders. (Legitimately saying ""It's your decision what we do for the holidays"".) It was phrased in a way to be beneficial to me since I'm tight on money and so are they.

They're solution was them and I meet halfway somewhere for the holidays, and then I fly out of the nearest airport for vacation. I tried to point out how absurd this is- I don't have the money to spend on extra plane tickets/train ticket/rental car (all suggestions they made), and it's inconvenient for me to essentially pack two suitcases for two trips. I said I don't have the capacity right now to deal with extra traveling as well as family drama right before vacation. I was told I was making the situation more difficult than it has to be, that they are also tight on money, and they were trying to compromise so they could see me.

I made the executive decision to give my bf's mom the okay to buy our vacation tickets. I called my parents and told them that my ticket was purchased and they had a deadline to see me for the holidays. After Christmas Day I would now not be available. They were irritated. I yelled at them on the phone saying they aren't being supportive of me, it's not my decision to make sure they request off work, and they had no intention to visit or they would've committed to plans months earlier. I cussed them out and criticized them for putting me in an awkward situation and not making an effort to see what Ive made of myself.

Informed my grandma of everything and the plan change. That has caused a spiral of drama, which at this point was inevitable since the cabins are now paid for.

My parents have hardly reach out or talked to me whatsoever. AITA for acting the way I did and refusing their compromise?",,

At that time I was back in my home country so I hadn’t met this girl. 
My bsf is bisexual and the other girl is a lesbian, so they started flirting a bit after meeting, they kissed twice and my bsf developed a crush on her, the girl apparantely has told her that she was only attracted to her but nothing else.
About three weeks after they met I got back home and I met the girl, we got along pretty well, my bsf had spoken to me about her and she had also spoken about me to her, she told me she had a crush on her and that they had kissed.
The first week meeting her I just thought that she was very fun, but that was it, about two weeks went by and we started getting along great, my bsf mentioned on occasions that she thought that this new girl liked me, since I wasn’t sure I just tried to ignore it and keeping living my life.
About a week after meeting me, the girl and my bsf went to talk and she told my friend that she was not interested in her, and that it was best if they stayed friends. My friend was dissapointed but she kind of kept being normal around the girl.
Fast forward three weeks, and my friend kept insisting that the girl liked me, I asked my bsf if she would be more comfortable if I just stopped talking to her or if she should stop hanging out with us, she told me not to, to keep everything normal.
Anyways, about a week or two after that conversation , the girl told me she liked me and I have been feeling pretty strongly about her too, nothing much that I can do to avoid it, we just connect very well, it feels very organic. I told her I think I like her too but that I don’t know about my whole friend situation thing, now my bsf noticed out behaviour and she seemed pretty angry and annoyed, which I completely understand, so I talked to her and asked her what she would rather I do, if I should stop talking to her or not see her anymore because I don’t want outr friendship ruined, yet I really like this girl and wouldn’t want to have to stop all that I feel.
Am I the asshole? 

TLDR: My bsf has a crush on a girl, after meeting me the girl started liking me , and after about a month I started developing feelings back, I told my friend and she is angry/sad but I also told her I could try to stop talking/ hanging out with the girl if that would be more comfortable to her.",,

Other times I just get up and go inside, depending on their timing and if I've gotten to smoke yet. 

Since legalization, it's pretty normal to smell weed in the air, and if it's not me it's just going to be someone else's.

She loses every friend or boyfriend she's ever had because she's a nasty person. She got a dog she can’t take care of so we all watch him for her without thanks.

Every single holiday she starts a fight and complains about something. EVERY holiday. If she got a gift she didn't like you'd think someone gave her a literal piece of shit the way she would flip out. I mean unbelievably insane things she would complain about (i.e. the type of plates we are using) and then say WE ruined HER holiday. This is just the tip of the iceberg, but basically she has made my entire life a living hell- always being nasty and then playing the victim, bullying my mom into buying her cigarettes at age 14, my parents having to call the police on her many times because they didn't know what else to do about her tantrums as a near adult. My parents agree she's a terror and from childhood to this day they call her ""satan"" and ""the evil sister"" but they obviously have always enabled this behavior.

She has worked the last several holidays so they’ve all been great, but as luck would have it she was off this year. For thanksgiving yesterday the 4 of us were supposed to go out to dinner then a Christmas light show at a local garden. All day long before dinner she was texting me how she hates our family, we don't care about her, she doesn't want to come to thanksgiving, etc., again just being a victim when literally no one had even spoken to her that day. 

Because I was so fed up with her bitching at me and going back and forth about coming to dinner, as if she wanted us to beg her to come, I said fuck it l'm not coming at all because yet again she has ruined another holiday and I would honestly rather be alone. I told my parents their best bet was to go to dinner alone because I couldn't be in the same room as my sister or even them because they just allow her to act like this. 

My parents did end up going to dinner alone and they skipped the light show. Everyone is blaming me because I started a fight with my sister and ultimately we both bailed on thanksgiving. I was very excited for us to go out to our fav places, but when she started her shit before dinner I just lost it.

My daughters are notorious for wanting something \*desperately\* using it for a week and then getting bored…it’s not their fault, it’s my fault for spoiling them.

The eldest (10) has an Xbox, a laptop, a Nintendo switch and her younger sisters' old tablet - she only really ever uses the Xbox and tablet, occasionally using the switch - her aunt got her the Xbox like two years ago? Not everything is shiny and new, but I don't think it has to be.

Her younger sister (8) shares the Xbox (doesn’t use it, was gifted to them both) has a tablet that she uses - she’s never asked for more devices apart from a phone.

Last Christmas youngest was desperate for space hop boots or whatever they’re called, she calls them ankle breakers and doesn’t use them.

Both children have rollerblades, a scooter and a bike - the youngest has a go kart and an electric car type toy (the eldest had a go kart but the wheel broke, and she didn't want it anymore)

Some of these toys are 3 years old, like her aunt got the youngest a go kart for her fourth birthday but she’s only recently been able to use it as the peddles were too tough.

My point: they’ve got \*\*so\*\* many toys, maybe we’ve spoilt them? I just don’t think realistically they can use them all.

A few weeks ago, the eldest mentioned a hover board for Christmas, the youngest also wants one so I said to their other parent if in a few weeks they still want one we will get them one.

I asked them separately; youngest wanted a hover board, eldest wanted something else…they both wrote a list, hoover board was on the youngest but wasn’t on the eldest.

I’m buying this year's gifts alone, my ex (their other parent) is unemployed, so I said I’d buy, and they’d be from both of us.

Ex said to the eldest “I thought you wanted a hoover board?” Eldest said yes!! So, I’m thinking she’s obviously going to agree now, if she forgot it in my eyes then she clearly didn’t want it badly - they’re expensive, it’s not something I want to get for it to be used once and forgotten.

So I said fine, give it another week if she still wants it I’ll order it, I ordered the youngest one this morning because she still wanted it (and honestly, she still uses 90% of the things I got her whilst eldest seems to move on fast)

Ex says I just want to trick my eldest and this is favoritism, I said no I just don’t want her settling on a toy that she’s already forgotten about.

Me and my cousin (lets call her cousin A) are really close and shes always been nice to me and ive always looked out for her. Although shes always partial to one of our mutual cousins (cousin B), which is fine by me as theyre closer but its sometimes a little annoying cause im sometimes pushed out of some gatherings and events.

There was a marriage in the family recently and all three of us were there along with our other relatives. We were at the reception and cousin A forgot her phone with the DJ and went off somewhere. Cousin B and i were sitting together and she came up with the brilliant idea of hiding it, i wasnt down with the idea but i didnt stop her cause i was talking to someone, she eventually hid it in here purse and then went away. When cousin A came back to get the phone, the DJ told her he gave it to cousin B she came to me asked where her phone was i told her i didnt know where it was. She became angry said some rude things took my phone and then rushed away, i told her that it was with cousin B but she kept my phone and continued to blame me for it. I went to look for cousin B, told her cousin A was angry took the phone and gave it back to cousin A who refused to give me back my phone and was still blaming me. I told her that it was cousin B’s idea and she hid it and i had nothing to do with it but she still didnt give back my phone which i ended up snatching from her.

Then she proceeded to blame me in front of everyone, at this point i was done with this and yelled at her about how she was being an idiot and not understanding that it wasnt me who took the phone. Now shes mad at me for yelling at her in front of everyone at a family gathering.

Im sorry this is so long for such a trivial thing, i just have no idea what to think",,

All my life my mother and father have been toxic asl, and I have been stuck in a continuous loop of wondering where \*I (\*and my sisters) went wrong. 

When I was around 12 years old, my mother told me while I was putting on my socks to go to school that my sisters and I are the reason her and my dad are always fighting. I was very confused as to how it was our fault, and asked ""How is it our fault?"" She then proceeded to fly into a rage at 7 AM and implied that she wished I would go missing and die, by referring to the news that was on TV about a runaway teen who had gotten murdered. Before anyone says that she could've meant something different, please understand when I say there was absolutely no other way this situation could have been interpreted.

My father is not any better. He has called me stupid, yelled at me in front of my friends, and has only ever been kind to me when he needs me. If I don't want to help him or I give him attitude for it (I admit I am mean to him), he starts saying things like ""You don't want to help your father?"" ""I do so much things for you and you don't want to help me?"" I get guiltripped into doing his work so that I can avoid trouble, or him snitching to my mom about horrible I am.

Now onto the situation.

My youngest sister has ice skating every Friday and Saturday, which me and my other sister paid for because she wanted to do it and my parents couldn't afford to. I was having a lot of stomach pain, so I didn't go with her to her lessons, but my other sister did (i usually go with her all the time with my mother). After they finished, they called my dad to pick them up. Once they came back, my father said to my mom, ""(other sister) said we don't give them anything can you believe it?"" to my mother. My mother got really mad, and started blaming all three of us (my sisters and I) for the reason her life is horrible. She said that we would end up leaving her alone, and that we were ungrateful for them doing whatever they could to provide for us. Then she said, ""I wish I had never had you three."" 

For context, I am the oldest, and so I have grown up seeing my parents struggle to bring scraps of money together so they can afford rent. My sisters and I didn't say anything, but after hearing from my sisters' perspectives what actually happened in the car ride home, I am very confused as to why my father would barge in saying that. According to my sisters, my dad was picking a fight by telling my younger sister she shouldn't do sports so she doesn't get hurt (mind you he always says this but we ignore him because it's bs). My other sister said that she then said, ""You say that for everything, it doesn't matter what sport. You're always trying to keep her (younger sister) from doing any sport."" Honestly, I believe my sisters more than my father because I've been a victim of him fabricating stories in his favor.

AITA (my sisters and I) for being ungrateful for what my parents have provided for us?",,

I 26f have been with my boyfriend 41m for 3 years. (No daddy issues. We were friends for almost a year before anything started happening) Before him and I were together he was with someone else and they had a Child. Bm and I don’t get along. I’m very blunt and up front about my issues and she’s much more on the side of entitlement. Not being mean at all. Just don’t like the temper tantrums on my porch cause she was told no or over stepping boundaries she knows for a fact we’re in place and she had been told about. There’s a long this that this bm had done to me. I’ve tried everything possible but realized it was basically just not going to get any better for the sake of the child so I just don’t interact with her. So last year my bf and I took pictures for Christmas cards with his child. Bm threw a temper tantrum about the cards and that my bf had asked me to post pictures on Facebook and so I did. My bf doesn’t stand up for me often and went with what bm had said and told me to take them down. I refused and explained that if I do the relationship is over cause I’m not going to live under bm control. So this year I said bf was more than welcome to do cards but I will not be in them nor will I post them on Facebook after the two week argument we had cause bm was jealous. So Christmas was already kinda off to a bad start this year. Bf said he didn’t want to do them without me so he just won’t cause I’m being difficult. So bf mom has a lot to do with bm. She talks to bm all the time. Sticks up for bm even when bm is in the wrong. Has pictures of bm up in her house. Anytime my bf or I am around she’s gotta talk about bm. So I just got tired of it and now I don’t go over for family dinners or anything besides holidays. Thanks giving just happened and apparently my bf had told his mom before hand no bm talk. So what does my bf mom do? Pulls my bf into the hallway to quietly talk about bm to my bf. I caught this and I was just done. My mood changed and everything. Well I keep the peace for the day but the today I tell him how that wasn’t cool but he’s just telling me I don’t understand and it was just about the bm saying he could have his child longer then what was originally set. I said I wasn’t going to Christmas cause I’m not dealing with this. Especially since they were in the hallway for around 5-10 minutes before I went looking for him. AITA?,,

We said no…are we the assholes? Her reaction was pretty bad and we felt awful. In the end we told her if it was between her living on the street and living with us, of course we’d help her out. But we feel there’s a lot of other ways she can go about this and our home should be a last resort. 

We explained that we’ve just begun our lives as a married couple and we need to put our relationship first. It’s also a small house and I don’t see it being practical to have her living with us.

I had to stay in hospital due to my anorexia. For info I'm not really overweight, I am 99 Ibs which is even underweight for most.

My mom (54) didn't seem bothered by my problem until my dad (52) asked her to check on me. He even kept spending hours with me during my recovery so I could slowly eat it. I just once tried and ate 3 times in a day, small portions but that was something big for me and my therapist.

Yesterday we were sitting at the dinner table, honestly beside ED, I am quite a picky eater. I can't really eat anything with a lot of calories. My mom loves that type of thing a lot, usually she is eating them and I am eating my own food which I am making.

My mom's siblings (56 and 42) and their kids (24, 20 and 12) came to our house. My mom prepared food for them and I was waiting to make my own but mom said, I can't. Apparently all the kids were eating the same thing and I couldn't eat anything else. I had to sit And eat the food they were eating.

I wanted to say something however my dad was out with his friends and I had no chance to say something so I chose to roll with it. Only thing I could really eat was the salad. I just ate it and suddenly my aunts started saying I will get fat and maybe I should stop eating. They laughed over it and my mom also said I was eating too much these days. I had to control myself or I would end up fat.

I felt extreme guilt with these words and my mom said they were harmless ""jokes"". I was being dramatic. Also she said I was still eating way too much these days.

I just got up and went to get my jacket, called my dad and left the dinner to meet with him. I honestly felt horrible for ruining his night but his friends told it's fine. They took me for food and they drank there too while I was trying and eating. After that we came back to the house, my mom said I just embarrassed her in front of others and I am a big AH for this.

She said she was only thinking about my health because I am her daughter and she cares about me.

It was a beautiful day and I got everything figured out in the end, but there was one HUGE problem - my makeup/hair artist never showed up. 

Per our contract and itinerary, she was supposed to arrive at 7:45 AM. Not only was she supposed to do my hair/makeup, but also my mother and two of my bridesmaids. At 8:30 AM I’m worried and I sent her a quick Instagram DM with no response. I try calling her twice and it rings and rings and goes to voicemail. 

My SIL calls the artist from her phone, and she answers on the first ring. Basically then says she thought the wedding was next weekend and is at a different event right now. I started crying. I just wanted this done. It was a budget wedding but I don’t know how to do my hair other than basic stuff and same with makeup. The MUA says she’ll call around and try and get someone else over ASAP (spoiler alert: no one is available). 

My mom and sisters end up finding me a woman in their church who was able to squeeze me in at her house between her kids soccer games for makeup, and we found a salon to do my bridal hair last minute. It honestly all turned out great, but god I was so stressed. I just wanted to relax and eat the fruit and snacks all morning with my sisters, instead I was running around town to get this done. (Side note: Ceremony was at 4, I didn’t get back to the venue from the hair appointment until 3:40… I had zero time to relax) 

Anyways, so a few days later the MUA sent a long apology email saying she felt sick to her stomach and she greatly apologizes (which I appreciate, I mean it’s a shitty mistake but she owned up to it) and refunded my deposit of $250. She also offered to do my hair and makeup for free for any other event. So now we get to the $200 I paid for my trial. 

I have a hard time even sending food back at a restaurant and so asking for that trial money back makes me feel like a legit Karen. I understand she still came out and did the trial with me, BUT I had to go in blind with the other angels who saved the day. So it honestly feels like it was useless to me…

I haven’t responded to the apology email because I have so much anxiety - and so many people are telling me to demand the trial money back but I just don’t know if that’s an asshole move or not. She apologized and refunded the deposit. Her contract states she is not liable for anything outside of the deposit monetarily. 

WIBTA for asking for my trial money back? 

Also extra note: I also feel I made an error; we never confirmed week of. However, we had this agreement for almost a year. Contracts signed with the wedding date and everything. I should have reached out week of but we were so busy I just assumed she’d be there because that’s her job - but like. I also feel partially responsible I guess.",,

He came over to hang out and play board games and he brought snacks and drinks, have in mind that my roommate was at work at the time. After my roomie arrived we played together a little and then bf picked up everything he brought and left saying he did not buy all that just for him to eat. Second argument - we went on a vacation with a few friends and I mentioned my dad who isn’t around most of the time but I still love him. He attacked me in the car for mentioning him and told me to prepare myself for he is going to duck with my brain every time I do because it’s my fault for not changing him. Third argument- My roommate and his gf found a dog and decided to give her to me since it’s my favorite breed and it was my birthday at the time. He decided to attack me again because he thinks I should not have pets because when we move in together he won’t live with them. Proceeded to tell me how I should give one dog to my mom, cat to my roomie, new dog to anyone who will take her and that he has room in his backyard for the third. I have told him that by giving them up I am giving up a part of myself and that he shouldn’t have been with me in the first place because he knows animals are my life. His whole family loves me and supports me openly but on the other side, my family and friends hate him and he doesn’t love them either (makes a fuss every time I go to my parents house or see a friend). I have been helping him renovate his apartment and he keeps forcing me to move in with him, so I think that he will propose soon. But how can I accept when he won’t accept me for who I am? So…WIBTA?",,

Now I am of a completely different religion and tbh, I have not felt completely comfortable hosting and conducting these activities. During these activities I feel extremely uncomfortable performing them because I know absolutely nothing about Christianity and I am just not comfortable preaching things that I know absolutely nothing about. 

I told my boss (32f, who comes up with these activities) that I wouldn't be doing devotionals anymore. She got annoyed and asked me, ""are you the activities director or assistant?"" and ""so you're uncomfortable reading from a book with explanations and playing music?"". She said she couldn't do it bcs she has a meeting at the time the devotionals are held, plus we hold them earlier, that will be around the time after the residents have had breakfast and they will be in a food coma. I just said ""I won't be doing devotionals from now on."" and that was the end of our conversation. 

I can't help feeling if there was a better way of handling the situation or maybe I should just take the bullet and do these devotionals. AITA?",,

It's been about 7 months since we've been together, since then I've tried to get my career setup. Anytime I have to leave the house alone my fiancee gives me a whole bunch of problems. In the beginning she would keep begging me to come home until I just gave in and did. She's made me quit a whole bunch of jobs just because I had to go out and do my job. She has been unemployed since we got together, and I pay her bills. 

First I quit best buy for her,I first get an opportunity to work with the PA Government services for my dream job but she made me call off my first day, resulting me to loose the job. Then I get an opportunity with a phone company inside Walmart, I'd be making base pay and commission there, that could pay my bills and pull me out of debt then I get an opportunity to become a manager at 2 Jimmy John's locations, easy 22$ hour, she made me quit within 3 days of working there. I go back to best buy for a solid 3 months before she made me quit there because she keeps begging me and saying shes gonna leave me. 

Now, I work with a Verizon management group, I'm gonna own my own store within 2 years, and they're gonna get me setup with all of the necessities, pay for my first and last month at a place to live, give me a location of my desire, and pay for any employee costs for first and last month, I can't let this opportunity to get past me. My fiancee is telling me she's gonna leave me, she's tried to sleep over at another dudes house, which has stated to her that he likes her very so, so I'm not comfortable with her staying there. She's been fighting me every day since I got the job, so I'm just tired, I told her if she does, I'll leave her bags at the door. She's saying I'm being inconsiderate for her feelings by choosing this job over her, but I'm just trying to get out of the 11,000 worth of credit card debt she's put me through, and catch myself up for the 5k worth of car payments I've missed by dealing with all of this. She also wants a kid, but I can't afford that, I need to work my balances down so I can actually start to save for a thing like that. So I guess I'm just going to get to the point

However, this text also mocked genocide and slavery. What UIL doesn’t know (and something I just discovered about myself via ancestry and DNA proof) is that I have a high blood percentage of one of the groups of people he made disparaging remarks about. The person who sent me the text also has a tendency to cut people out of his life, including family members of the person who wronged him. I responded that I didn’t find what he said funny, explained the history behind why it’s not funny, and said that I don’t ever condone or find racist jokes funny. I also said I was disengaging from texting further as he made me uncomfortable and that I’d continue the conversation when he was ready to have a dialogue or apologize. I showed my husband UIL’s text, he became irate, and encouraged me to screenshot it. He said i could handle it any way I wanted, but encouraged me to send it to the family group chat. UIL makes shitty comments all the time and flies under the radar. When someone comes forward they aren’t believed/are ignored/dismissed because he “has a mental illness”.

This morning I received another text from UIL. Basically the text doubled down on why he was right, and how my being offended is wrong. His response pissed me off, and I’m seriously considering outing him for the racist he is. WIBTA for exposing UIL as a racist in a family group chat?",,

This is my first post, so I'm trying to figure out how this works. 


My [47M] wife [37F] is a ""bad person"" according to my daughters. My daughters' ganging up against her needs to stop because we are a family and need to stick together. 

I have dated my wife publicly for three months, but in private, I have known her since my recent ex. She has shaped me to be a better person than I was when with my ex. Her strong moral and Christian values are what have strengthen me as a father and as a man. I wasn't as involved with the church before with my ex, but my wife shows me what it is like to fear God just as everyone should. When we disagree about money or the state of the country, sometimes she yells at me which reinvigorates my relationship with God. However, the closer I have gotten to her, the further my daughters have gotten from me. I really don't know why they're trying to hate on my wife (their step mother) because she is the best thing that has happened to us as a family. They have grown more distant and it hurts my feelings because God did not promise me that they would stray from me as a parent. I feel disrespected and ignored. They act so abnormal and this behavior came out of nowhere. They never act like this with my ex (their mother), and always side with her. 

An example of their behavior is when my daughter has ""disowned"" me in the past and has ignored me for about a year due to a melt down she had at a family gathering. In response, I took her car that I gave her for her birthday, canceled her phone, and her health insurance in hopes she would return. I still offered her help via email and through her mother despite not getting any response for, once again, a year. 

Before getting married to my wife, I have even asked my daughters if this is the right choice. But despite their answer, they are still upset, and I can't win. I have been married three times, is fourth time the charm? AITA?",,

We go to pick her up to get breakfast but she wasn't ready yet. So we end up waiting for what I believe was 45 mins. I was a little irritated not gonna lie. When she was done we got to the restaurant they said it would be a 45 min to an hour wait. So we decided to wait. During that time I was playing a game on my phone Fate Grand Order. I am addicted to this game and it is a way to make me feel better and kill time. While we were waiting the guy I dated went out to call some other restaurants and while playing my game I did talk to his friend and we had a bit of a conversation during the wait.

We both said we were down to play a game on one of out phones but that did not happen because I food came out. We eat and go on our way.

Weeks later he ask me why did I not talk during the breakfest. I told him cause I was nervous meeting and was a little irritated. He did not respond.

Today we had a little talk about stuff and he brought up that me playing on my phone and not even making an effort. He said the differences in age/maturity was apparent. I told him I was nervous and wasn't ready to meet this friend. The only thing he texted back was he was tied up in work.",,

My friend is a part time manager and says she has a second job, she takes the three busiest days if the week off (discount day, Friday, and Saturdays)  and only works 4 days max (which she complains about). 

The thing is, she doesn't have a second job. She just tells them that so they won't schedule her days she doesn't want to work.

Six months ago I broke up with my ex due to his lack of thought and care for me throughout our relationship and I also found out he had cheated in the first 2 weeks of our relationship, we had been together for nearly a year and I decided I could not do it anymore. I guess he felt like it was out of the blue because he had a hard time accepting the fact that I no longer wanted to be with him and he sent me messages trying to convince me to get back together and even got some of his friends to bombard me with messages saying how depressed I had made him and how I “broke up with him out of spite because I’m toxic”? When I continued to say no to getting back together he blocked my phone number and social media’s and went on a damage telling my friends I was the one who had cheated and basically badmouthing me. During this period I had decided to throw away everything he had left at my house including a couple of shirts, a jumper, some books and some cheap key chains. I had no way of contacting him because I had been blocked and I wanted all the stuff out of my house? 

2 months later he had unblocked me and sent me messages begging for forgiveness and telling how sorry he was and how much of a better man he is. I just ignored them. However, last night while I was working I was bombarded with messages from him demanding that I return everything from my house that was his or else I would have to pay for them, when I told him that would be impossible since I had thrown everything away around 4-5 months ago. He then went on a tirade calling me all sorts of names and telling me I HAD to pay him back, I informed him he wasn’t getting no money off of me and never to contact me again and that he could of collected his stuff if he hadn’t blocked me in the first place. 

This morning I woke up to a few texts from some people telling me I should have been a bigger person and dropped all his stuff off to one of his friends or family members because the stuff might have meant something to him and I should pay him back the money.

For any giftsgiving holiday, my sister, BIL, mom, and I email lists to each other and people buy off the lists, with occasional ""surprise"" presents that the giver thinks the recipient might like.

Back when I taught daycare and was ridiculously poor, I could barely afford anything, particularly ""extra"" things like presents. (I usually relied on the daycare parents giving me useful gift cards I could use to buy them a couple of things on Christmas Eve.) Because of this, I asked if I could be left out of the gift exchange, and I was shot down, ""because we like buying things for you, and it's not like we expect you to spend the same amount as us."" So I kept doing it. And it got easier 5 years ago when I got a job that paid more.

I often have issues coming up with a list. Mostly because I live fairly simply, and buy what I need when I need it. I usually end up putting things on my list that seem plausible enough, and maybe I'll use them, but probably not. Like last Christmas, part of what I asked for was yoga and exercise stuff. I've not touched any of it. In fact one of the weight thingies sat in my car until a couple of weeks ago and the rest are still in the box I used to carry them home from Christmas.

This year is worse. I've spent the last few months (started in June, but August through the start of November was the worst) being desperately sick. I'm not yet fully recovered, although I'm normal enough, I guess. But this means I've had even less cause to need anything. The list I sent has 15 things on it, 4 things of which I actually want (2 of which I can easily do without, and 2 of which are inconsequential enough I could buy for myself).

My sister and mom sent their lists the 18th/19th, but I work retail, and that week is insane on top of still recovering, so I hadn't looked yet. At Thanksgiving my sister had questions, so I tried to open up the lists to look. She also forwarded my BIL's list. Turns out I couldn't open my mom's, and she couldn't either, so she said she'd send it later.

Everyone's list is horrible for the most part. My sister has already bought every non clothes item off my mom's list, and I refuse to buy clothes, as my mom and sister are so picky. My sister's is 75% things recycled from previous lists that no one wanted to buy before and still don't want to buy. (To be fair, I've attempted to buy 2 of them before, but they were impossible.)

I don't want to deal with it. I also don't want stuff that will just take up space in my house solely so they can be happy they got me something. Especially as my sister is working the 24th, 25th, and 26th, so we aren't even getting together on Christmas. I'll still get my niece and nephew presents, but WIBTA (in addition to being a Grinch, obviously), if I said I'm not going to get any adults presents and don't want them to get me any?",,

We dated for 3 years, during this time I pleaded for him to seek various sources of help. He struggled with substance abuse, and mental health. All of which I was there for and did my best to
support him on self improvement. He would at times (when he was allegedly be sober) make huge claims and become so paranoid that I would have to act very carefully to calm him down. He would look at me with suspicion and claim I was a government agent sent to spy on him and he had me all figured out. It would happen suddenly… and I couldn’t do anything to calm or talk him down. It was so fearful for him that he tried to flee and his state was so uneasy that taking his keys out of the ignition was all I could think of. It wasn’t just me it was everyone… his best friends and parents. 
After this sequence occurring over and over despite our level headed conversations about how harmful and unhealthy they are are… he refused to get help saying “it was just a dumb thought I had.” Dismissing the long hours of repeated conversations where he would plead for me not to hurt him (I have never ever hurt him before this was just some paranoid illusion) and other outlandish fear regarding me being a secret agent. 
After this repeated over and over and I could sense it coming on again I would just shut it down. When the paranoia began I would tell him “No you are not going to start this and accuse someone who loves you as out to get you.” This is why he called me dismissive of him. 
In my opinion I was tired of this 3-4 hour frenzy where his brain goes wild picking out any conspiracy theory he can about our relationship. I pleaded for him to get help. I had listened and tried to help him, but allowing him to go on this rant wasn’t something I deemed necessary as it would just be chaos.

It cause me to be in agony about 99% of the time and all my friends know this. They also know I hate people making jokes about it and how disability’s aren’t something to joke about. My pain in my body increased severely in September and i have been feeling like my limbs are being torn off. My chances of having surgery soon to fix this and this would take over 2 years- hence I would be in a wheelchair. I am terrified of this and my life has changed drastically since my pain worsened. I am unable to get up to my lessons and am missing out on education.

So today we came out of school early because we had finished mocks finally (yay). Some of my friends are in a production for the school and it included a wheelchair. This kid, we’ll call him A (M15), was asking about the production and the wheelchair came up, its an old lady in a wheelchair. He started to laugh and told my friend who was playing the old lady to steal the wheelchair. What he said next pissed me off so hard. 

“ hey can you steal it for me so i can have it and get disabled benefits?”

A knows all i go through as a disabled teenager.  I stared at him in shock before wacking his arm.  I started to scream at him “Don’t joke about that!  Your sick!” And essentially called him a horrible person.  I had started crying at this point that a person i thought was my friend was joking about a situation that was similar that i was in. i walked off still crying and what hurts the most is the fact none of my other friends stopped him. 

I feel like my reaction was a little extreme but people who joke about faking a disability to get things. I have told A that I don’t like going in the lift but i have to because of my problem.

I am sensitive about my smell, doing very physical sport and my dad telling me I stunk after heavy exercises. I shower twice daily (needed as I live in a desert) and use MENs deodorant stick, antiperspirant spray periodically during the day and top up with parfume throughout the day especially after a smoke. Recently after a minor disagreement, out of the blue she tells me “and another thing, some people close to you at work are saying that there is an odour to you”. This for me is strange as I barely interact with anyone at work, I am never in the staffroom or spend much time with anyone, in addition my students often tell me I smell nice and I have had multiple coworkers ask what my parfume is. She told me that she just wanted to be kind and that she didn’t want me to get hurt. I took this under consideration and evaluated if there was anything I could do to fix this. I asked my flatmate who I am closest with if she or any of those in our circle had said anything and she said no. 

The next day my flatmate who is friends with her approached me to check on me as this had an effect on me making me feel a little humiliated and hurt and flatmate wanted to check if I was ok. Flatmate stated that she has never experienced said odour but that coworker had approached her and asked if she had smelled me before. This upset me as it became clear that they were discussing this in the staffroom. I told my flatmate that what hurt the most is that this friend would not say who had been speaking about me but kept insisting that it was people “close to me”. 

The next day I received multiple aggressive texts from said friend who accused me of telling my flatmate that I had told her, that this friend had said it was flatmate. Mind you I had not once said anything negative about this friend and was still under the impression that she had just wanted to be kind. I told her to ask the people she was discussing me with, and not me as I had not said anything bad against her, nor had I implied or said that she had named anyone. She then continued and said that “she was just trying to be kind, but some people just didn’t deserve her kindness”. At this point I again told her I had done nothing wrong and that if that is how she felt she should just take her kindness elsewhere. She BLEW UP, demanding that I say this to her face, telling me to come to her class and have the BALLS to say it to her. I told her that in no way would I solve a personal matter at work and that she should be professional. I just feel that her “kindness” was destroyed by her aggressive attacks on me despite me not having done anything she was accusing me of.

When I got there, I saw my dad with another man in the kitchen. They weren't naked or anything, but it was obvious it wasn't just a friendly interaction (my dad was sitting on the counter with his friend in his lap lol).
Here's where I might be the asshole: Instead of talking to my dad about it to try to understand what was going on, I ran away until I got to a store with some privacy and called my other dad and told him what I saw.
He picked me up, dropped me off back home, and went to stay at my aunt's house for the night.
When I got home and told my dad why my other dad wasn't home, he was upset with me. He didn't yell or anything but he looked like he was about to cry and told me that wasn't what was happening. He said his friend was struggling with an illness that could cost him his life, and he had grown up in an unaccepting environment and wanted to experience the kind of love he wanted before he died; My dad agreed, which led to what I saw earlier, but he claims he very quickly shut the situation down and didn't go any further. He asked me to explain to my other dad the truth, but I felt as though should try to explain this to my other dad himself, as he deserves to know.
This next bit requires a little context: Having a sweet 16 has been my dream ever since I was little. My family used to be very poor and I never got to celebrate any of my birthdays but my dads both worked very hard to get us to where we are now, and we agreed I would have the extravagant birthday party of my dreams.
This is relevant because my dad said if I didn't do this for him, he would no longer fund my birthday party. He wouldn't cancel it, but I don't have enough money to fund everything myself. I didn't ask for any gifts or anything else from them - just this.
We went back and forth for a while until I started crying and my dad left the house. I'm now alone in my room and I can't sleep. I don't want to have ruined my parents relationship, and I know it's selfish but I want to have this party so badly. I don't know what to do. AITA?",,

the story main story starts off with my grandma calling me and gushing about my cousin(16m) and how proud she is if his career… he works at mcdonald’s. i am not shaming him for what he chooses to do but he is 16 and a high school drop out. she starts to mention how he is saving up for a car. i told her that I am happy for him and then he comes on the phone and starts mentioning how I have a brand new car in the drive way that is not being used and I could already see where he was going with the conversation and I ignored it. my grandma then started saying “well honey , your car hasn’t been touched since august and since your cousin needs to get around you could lend it to him until you get your license.” i immediately shut it down and said “absolutely not. he is on drugs and I do not trust him to be using my car.” 
another thing to mention is my cousins mom is a drug addict and he lived with my grandparents before I ran away. he moved out after they started enforcing rules when he began lying to them about doing drugs. my grandparents gave him allowances and were even going to get him a brand new truck but he threw away all of those opportunities for drugs. 
my cousin started calling me a spoiled brat and said that it is not fair that my grandparents give me better opportunities than him because they feel bad about me leaving my parents house,and just because I am the first in the family to go to college I don’t have the right to be entitled. my grandma is very neutral on the situation because I know she favors me and everyone is quick to call that out but I do think I deserve it. he has had almost the exact same opportunities as me but compared to him I am obviously going down the right path and I absolutely adore my grandparents. i do not think I am the ah but I have had texts from my cousins and my aunt calling me nasty names and pressuring me to give him my car.",,

I knew from the start of my relationship that Billy had previously had feelings for his best friend, Emily, but she’d never reciprocated them. 

While Billy encouraged me bonding with his other friends, he was always weird about me spending time with Emily. I put it down to him being worried I was going to steal his best friend, so I very rarely spent time with her.

Two things started happening at the same time about 6 months into the relationship: Billy got distant and wanted to spend less time with me, and he was spending more time with Emily. It wasn’t as obvious when it happened as it looks on the page due to mental health &amp; family issues, but it wasn’t fun. 

Long story short, Billy and I went on a ‘break’ after I asked for some space to figure out if I wanted this anymore. During this time, he went on holiday with his friends, and Emily drunkenly confessed to him she had feelings for him there. They talked about the possibility of having a relationship, and there was ‘neck kissing’. 

On finding this out I immediately broke up with Billy and we had no contact for a few months. Emily seemed to really want to put things right, and we met to talk everything through. She said she was aware that their friendship was inappropriately close, but had tried to take space from him several times for my sake. She hadn’t meant to develop feelings for him or end our relationship. She’d cut off contact with him, and they’d mutually agreed that any relationship between them would be unhealthy. She was honest with me and I really appreciated it, and I could tell she was remorseful so we remained friends. 

Recently Billy and I have started causally seeing each other again. I’m nowhere near as invested as I was before, but I’ve honestly never seen a man do such a genuine 180 in terms of self-awareness; he’s been in therapy, is deeply apologetic, loving and has been treating me better than he ever has before. I’m moving cities soon anyway so I’m just enjoying it while it lasts, which might be a bad idea but I’m in my twenties and trying to have a good time finally lol.

However, when Emily found out she really caught me off guard. She was mad at me and said that Billy and I seeing each other has come at a hard time for her. She told me not to forget that this situation involves more than just me and him, and said that this wouldn’t be happening if she was still speaking to him (she might be right, but it doesn’t matter much to me rn). I’m upset as I feel like I tried to be a good friend to her despite all this. But some of her friends have sided with her and I know this is complicated. AITA?

TL;DR: I’m casually seeing my ex again, who I split with because he had emotional affair with a mutual friend. The friend is upset at me for seeing him again as she says I didn’t consider her feelings.",,

My older brother and his wife were staying with them since they live out of town. I do love my family, but I have not gotten perfectly along with my mother and my brother in recent years. 

My mother is very gossipy and always tries to manipulate me whenever we have a disagreement. Her side of the family became very broken when my grandmother passed away from cancer 3 years ago. Since then, I have gotten this notion that she wants to fill that void when my brother and his wife start to have children. She puts this pressure on me as well. She is embarrassed of the fact that I am 28 and have not had a serious relationship yet. I do want to find the right person, but I cannot rush or force a relationship.

My brother likes to pretend that he is always there for me. He rarely responds to me whenever I try to call/text him. He always claims that he is busy. Whenever he visits, he is always playing on his phone so I know he gets my messages. I get along with my dad the most. He's introverted like me, so I feel like he understands me the most.

The day before Thanksgiving, I told my family that I had plans to watch a hockey game with a friend. When I arrived for Thanksgiving, they asked me how the game went and I said that my team lost. 

My mom has this habit of asking me questions that she knows the answers to and asks ""Well was your friend happy?"" I responded with ""Considering that he is a Detroit fan, I imagine that he was happy."" My mom, offended by my sarcasm, walked up to me and said ""You are going to feel nothing but regret when I die."" I was just trying to be funny.

My brother mentioned baseball and he always brings up a story of when I went to a baseball game with my cousin. Long story short, my cousin made some poor choices at this game and was arrested. He says that this is why I do not watch baseball anymore. My family thinks this story is hilarious. For me, it was very upsetting.

We then talked about my other friend, whose family has recently started making a living on being YouTube/TikTok influencers. Last week, my friend told me how much money they make doing this and I told my family about it. My brother told me that I ""shouldn't be talking about their income and that I need to be careful."" This bothered me.

After dinner, my mom could tell I was checking my watch. She asked if I had somewhere to be. I panicked and said yes, but I couldn't say where. In reality, I just wanted to go home. She told me ""If you're lying, I hope that you get struck by lightning on the way home tonight."" I got so angry and walked out. She followed me and banged on my car windshield as I drove away.

My dad texted me to call him. I wanted to, but I was too upset. 1 hour later, my brother drove up and rang my doorbell, I refused to open the door and he left.

I just feel so conflicted on the entire night, I do feel bad about getting so angry, but I cannot allow my family to say whatever they want to me.",,
