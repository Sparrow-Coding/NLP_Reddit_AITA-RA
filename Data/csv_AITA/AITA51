5 months ago I had an incident that left me partially paralyzed in one leg, and a few other shitty health related things. I've made a pretty great recovery and   can now walk much better . I'm in physio and The only things I'm left with is occasionally I'm extremely fatigued. It hits me like a tonne of bricks and I can't keep my eyes open to save my life. (There's other issues but this is the one that would affect me taking care of a baby)

I have a 1 year old with my wife and she's going back to work next week. She was worried about leaving me alone with the baby but I'm confident that if I get a great night sleep, drink some coffee I can power through and will be just fine.  

My wife asked me yesterday if her mother could come stay with us for a week or two while she returns to work. I agreed and was very supportive of the idea as it was giving my wife peace of mind while she returns to work. I was mildly uncomfortable because my MIL is a ""prude"". When she's here I can't have alcohol or any marijuana. (I'm not using it durring the day, just in the evenings with dinner is my usual routine). I am someone who also has been using humor to get me through this rough time and my mother in law is not a joking type of person. If someone cracks a joke she will react offended and serious.  

Today I find out that my wife and MIL were chatting and the week visit turned into the entire month of December. I've always been polite and respectful with my mother in law but the idea of her living in the house for the next month watching my every move is become horribly anxiety inducing. My mental health has been garbage lately as I already try to cope with my limited abilities. I havnt been able to function how I used to and it's been really taking a toll on me. I have much higher anxiety and battling with some shitty mental health over all.

I chatted with my wife and basically she doesn't agree. She will be working 10 hour days and I will be the one home alone with baby and MIL. I offered a compromise and said how about she comes down closer to Christmas and for the first week my wife is at work I have my grandma come over. (My grandma isn't able to lift the baby but she can assist me with the cooking, cleaning etc) 

I already feel like I've lost so much control of my life after this accident and having my prude of a MIl judging my every move is not going to help my mental health. I want to rip my hair out and just run away from this.

My ‘sister’ is technically the daughter of a neighbor/long-term family friend that I’ve known my whole life. I’m biologically an only child. She is so amazing and honestly the kindest person I’ve ever met but…she’s overweight. Frankly, the only reason I mention this fact is a matter of concern. 

I, 27F, recently lost 113 pounds in one year. I kick-started my fitness journey after a doctor's appointment. A shitty doctor's appointment where I got the news that if I didn’t change my life, I’d die early. He confirmed I was pre-diabetic amongst a myriad of things that scared the hell out of me. After that appointment, I ran five days out of the week and maintained a healthy diet. Suddenly, I was hot! Suddenly, people looked me in the eye and opened doors for me. Suddenly, I was actually confident.

My sister, 29F, witnessed my transformation after receiving similar news at a doctor's appointment a week after me. We both agreed to schedule these appointments to commit to being healthy in our thirties. Keep in mind, she weighs sixty pounds less than me! After that day, she gave up. She worked out but very minimally and never broke a sweat. She always complained about being sore but spent five minutes on a treadmill. 

After about a month into my confidence boost, she started treating me differently. My jokes seemed to garner a weak smile but never a laugh. She would start to frown if I looked in her direction. I knew something was up and I confronted her. I told her I could no longer deal with the snide remarks and dry behavior. She just turned her nose up and said, “I’m tired of you acting like a skinny little bitch!”. 

I was stunned that she managed to sound so hateful. FYI, my sister is gorgeous and always has been. Throughout childhood, people would literally stop to compliment her! She is a Southern beauty queen pretty! Before I could stop myself, I screamed,  “At least I’m not making FAT ASS anyone else’s problem!”. Tears started streaming down her cheeks immediately after this. She grabbed her purse and exited my living room in a rush. She sped down the street and into the night. That was two days ago and we have not spoken since.

I mean, I'll physically be at the location of the reveal, but I would just be upstairs &amp; watch the reveal from my bedroom window.

I should probably get into why I don't want to go to my own reveal anymore...

Basically, my MIL has been planning this party for a month now, which is fine I have no issues with MIL planning the party, but the issues I do have is that everyone keeps cancelling after assuring me they would be there. First, my biological father won't answer my texts or invites which basically means he's not showing up. Then, my friend said she's sick &amp; not coming. THEN my adoptive father told me he's working &amp; not coming which is confusing because I gave them all an invite two weeks before &amp; his job gives him work a couple days before which pretty much means he's CHOOSING to work over my reveal after he said he was coming. And another one of my friends said they aren't coming, but they didn't give a reason.

It's looking like none of my friends &amp; family are going to be there, aside from my husband &amp; i, his mother, two sisters &amp; brother. I just kinda don't feel a point in even having one anymore... No one ever shows up for my events, but will show up for everyone else in the family.

My husband is upset with me, because he says the reveal is meant for the both of us, but it doesn't feel that way since I never got any options or chose with where or how we were doing the reveal, but my husband did bc his mom is deliberately shutting me out of the plans.

I had to pretty much beg them to not do a puzzle or scavenger hunt bc they frustrate me when I can't figure them out, &amp; if I get frustrated then the party wouldn't be fun for me.

This was a meetup event with some of our kids friends and their parents.  There were lights, snacks, food, pictures with Santa, etc.  We were supposed to be there at 5, but I was late because of a hectic day work.  I had informed my wife hours before that I was likely going to be 15-20 minutes late and would meet her there, so I could go right from work.  

I got there around 5:15pm, and called my wife to find out where to meet.  They had already gone in and started the walk.  They came back around to the front so we could meet up and I joined in for a second walk around the cactus light garden.  As we are finishing up, my 5 year old asked if he could do pictures with Santa again.  My wife said they are $25 for each pic, so we aren't doing any more.  At that point, I was like wait, did you guys do a Christmas pic with Santa before I got here?  She said yeah, he wanted a pic.  I said ""that's cool, but I would've liked to join too.  Was it just the boys, or it was the 3 of you?"". She said it was all 3 of them.  So turned out she bought 2 pics, one with the boys and Santa, and one with her, the boys, and Santa.  

I don't know if I should've felt like my feelings were hurt, but they were!  She knew I was on my way and I had communicated about being late as soon as I realized my work load was too much to be out on time.  She asked if I was upset, and I told her I was.  That she knew I was on my way and could've waited 15 minutes until we were all there.  The thing that bugged me is that had my son not asked to do the pic with Santa ""again"", I wouldn't have known that they already did, and she sure didn't seem like she was going to ask if I wanted to do a family pic with them.  I just felt excluded, I feel like Christmas photos that you pay for are kind of a family thing.

This didn't start any crazy fight or anything, but we didn't talk much last night and haven't much today either. We argued a bit over it and she didn't see my perspective, of feeling left out.  She just said ""the kids wanted pictures, so I did"".

My wedding ended up being far more expensive than initially anticipated, and through many talks with my mother she approved the use of her Amex and another credit card to be used for the excess in charges. My fiancé, now husband and I make 20k+ a month with our dual income, and we created a repayment plan with my mother. 25k would be paid right away and the rest would be paid monthly. 16k to her directly, and 9k toward the Amex. I enrolled the Amex in a 6.99% rate and the idea was to pay off the other credit card as fast as possible because it had a 21.99% rate. 

We went over this many times and we were both clear what was to happen in terms of repayment. About 3 weeks after my wedding and the day I received my wedding photos, my mom had a full blown meltdown about the credit card charges and decides to involve my brother in a private financial matter that had nothing to do with him. Embarrassing myself and my husband for no reason outside of causing drama and strife amongst all of us. You’re thinking to yourself - well what did you do to cause your mom to reach out to your brother? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I was looking at my wedding photos and told her I would chat with her later because I was super focused on it, and she decided right then to involve my brother. She blew up a situation that didn’t need to be blown up. Which led to a lot of misinformation and lies on her end, which I had to then have her admit she was lying to my brother. Most recently, she has been incredibly toxic and mean saying that my husband dragged his feet marrying me, while causing strife between my husband and I (we were together for 3.5 years before getting engaged). Since she has said this, I have not spoken to her and chosen to not involve myself with anything to do it her.

When I told him I was hurt especially yesterday when he told me he was too busy to talk but he spent an hour with another friend, he told me to relax and not think so much.

So he’s telling me I’m wrong, and I’m feeling hurt so I guess I decided to try to give him what he wants. And be civil but not text much anymore.

My wife and I are invited to a gathering with her co-workers (they are teachers) for dinner. Every time we are invited to this particular house, my wife tends to be more of a worker rather than just enjoying the party and having the host do things hosts are expected to do. This time, my wife asks me out of the blue if I could smoke meats for the party which is at the end of a busy week for me. I ask, ""Well....aren't we invited to the part as guests?"" To which she answers ""Every is supposed to bring a food item."" Well....I feel the host should provide the main part of the meal and guests bring side dishes or dessert items. I say I have no problem smoking the meats, but is the host going to help with the cost? Chicken is cheap and easy, but I was asked to do tri-tip or brisket. As we all know, beef isn't cheap, but I figure I could do a tri-tip because it's easier and less expensive than brisket. I also am smoking two chickens as I write this.  To top this off, my wife also makes a side dish AND we have to bring chairs! 

So, I ask you this: AITA for thinking I feel the host is putting more on me and my wife to make this party a successful meal?  I will tell you this: When I host a dinner, my guests have nothing to worry about. No chairs needed. No food needed. Wine, beer, soft drinks, water are not needed. People usually bring something and that's cool, but I never ask for it. I took the day off from work to shop for food, prep the food, and load the chairs into the van. I pinched the shit out of my finger doing that. If this were just a one off, I would be cool with it. Unfortunately, this is the 3rd time this has happened. We are also the last to leave because my wife insists on helping clean up afterwards. She doesn't do that at OUR house!

At the same time, while his daughter was being playful in my presence, I'm always looking at/out for her (who could ignore such a cute kid) and I'm like dude, those hoses on the ground are a tripping hazard etc etc etc. My friend is always downplaying, saying how she'll always find a way to trip even etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Story in point. They spent the last few months rennonvating and finally done. Needless to say, I was free labour and as a result the first to see their 'new' house. I was standing in the main room with him while his wife was in one of the rooms cleaning, with their daughter running around being a kid.

I looked around and was like, dude you need some child proofing pointing at sharp step edges, bench corners, this could happen, that could happen etc etc. This didn't faze my friend at all, as that's what we've  been doing for the past 5 or so years since the two of us bought our own places. His wife on the otherhand heard it and brought it up to his attention after I had left. Saying how I overstepped my boundaries, because it's their house and their daughter and how I'm talking as if they're incompetent as parents despite not being one myself and even if I was, it's their house so I shouldn't be saying how they should change things.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, nothing is secret in a 20 year friendship and so I'm thinking if I'm too comfortable at their place and since then, haven't been around as much (especially when she's there).

We are planning a two week trip to the dominican republic in spring of next year. My wife and I are paying for the youngest 4 obviously but as my daughter is an adult with a full-time job I expected her to pay for her own part of the trip. This is by far the most expensive holiday we've ever been on and have been saving up for it for a couple years. She only pays £300/m for rent and utilities at her mom's house and shouldn't have any other large expenses as her car has been paid off for a year. 

When I told her she would be paying most of her own trip she initially agreed and didn't have a problem with it. A week ago I was confirming dates and prices with her before I booked and she decided that she no longer wanted to pay for the trip. I only wanted her to pay £1400 for the trip about 600 less than the price per person. I understand it's expensive for a young adult but she had previously agreed knowing this is what I would expect her to pay and said she was saving for the trip. I also told her she didn't need to pay me all in one go but that I needed at least £700 from her before I book the trip and she could pay the rest within a year. I think this is reasonable.

I've put off booking the holiday for the time being in the hopes she'll come around. I've told her that if she doesn't agree to pay then the rest of the family will still go without her and she'll miss out. She thinks it's unfair that she has to pay when I'm paying for the rest of kids (they're children). She pointed out we never went on a vacation like this when she was still a child (we mostly did caravan holidays in UK/france) and I'm therefore giving her siblings experiences she never got. She also says her friend's parents still pay for them to go on holiday with their family. My younger daughter is also upset about the possibility of going without her sister and says it will ruin the holiday for her. 

My ex-wife also thinks I'm being unreasonable as she agrees with our daughter about her not having the same experiences as the younger kids because we had less money when she was younger. My daughters step-dad has offered to pay me the initial £700 but I feel weird about taking money from him.

So my mom walked in on me crying due to stress. I am stressed because my parents have been threatening to send me back to public schools if I have a single D on my report card. Rn I have 3 F's in math biology and English because it's been getting hard to read and stay focused. The words blur and move and the colors blend in sometimes. When I ask for help I just get yelled at told I'm stupid and then told ""should I do it for you since you refuse to understand"". So basically it's been hard to do homeschool/online school. Yeah I broke down and cried due to the stress, my mom (the only one home rn) walked in and asked what's wrong. Now my mom has a habit of after I tell her something she'll blame me then yell at me for being ""weak and r-slur"", that I am just like ""add someone she hates here"". That really hurts me so I try to block her away from my emotional state. So after she asked I said nothing and that I need a few minutes. She got mad and said ""why won't you open up to me anymore this is why your always depressed and crying god your such a baby"" . I admit I sorta snapped back but I said ""maybe if y'all didn't read my diary in 5th grade we wouldn't be here "". She got mad and said to not have that time with her and that she did it for my ""own good"". That last part I know is a damn lie, I was already very open with my parents about everything. But that notebook had some of my raw emotions, my vents about things I knew if I told my parents they'd get mad and say I didn't understand bc I'ma kid. It also had criticism about my parents and how they are raising us. After they read my diary and got mad to the point they beat me with a belt said I'm disrespectful and punished me for it. I promised myself I would never let them see me emotional again, just because I feared them and I still do to this day. But after I said that and my mom ranted how I was disrespecting her she told my dad (he's out of state he's a truck driver) he's now disappointed in me for my grades and my attitude.

Some girl then came up to the board and asked the teacher if she can clean it. I told her to not erase the part that I wrote on, and then she decided to go ahead and start erasing that part first to annoy me, despite there being writing on the board closer to her. I then slightly pushed her to make her stop doing it, and I guess while pushing her I accidentally touched one of her breasts with the bottom of my hand's palm.

Now, I would just like to mention something: I'm not interested in girls at all, and me touching her there was a complete accident.

So anyway, she then decided to take the opportunity and get me in trouble, because the girls in my school always like to mess with people, and I am a fairly big target because of some anger management issues I have. She started fake-crying, and saying that I ""sexually harassed"" her by touching her there. And might I mention we are both 13 years old. She was smiling while doing the crying, and the science teacher could literally see her doing it and was telling her that she was obviously laughing. I just ignored the situation, and all the girls in the class were supporting her for obvious reasons. Meanwhile, most of the boys and the science teacher were supporting me and saying she was faking it.

She then ran out into the toilet and the class continued like normal. The teacher told both of us to stay after class and talked to us about how we are both at fault because she was obviously provoking me, and I reacted violently.

I thought that would be the end of the situation, and the day went on normally. But I guess she REALLY wanted to get me in trouble, because she complained to her parents about me ""harassing"" her, and they then proceeded to complain to the Head of Secondary about it.

The teachers were on my side yesterday, and they were on my side while talking to my mom today too, but since it's a school and they kinda need a good reputation, they had to give me a punishment for what I did. So now I will have to miss some lessons to be separated from the other students.

Now, I should mention that the girl I pushed was Turkish, and *apparently* over there women and men tend to stay separate from each other most of the time. But she's been going to this school for longer than me and should have learned that things are different here by now.

When I interviewed for the role I was told it would be mostly sales with some admin. I said that was fine. However the role has turned out to be almost all admin with maybe 20% sales and that’s just not what I signed up for.

I decided to quit and get a new role. Technically I only have to give 1 week notice but I’ve offered to serve 2 weeks. However my manager (the owner of the business) was really angry at me when I gave my notice. He said I’ve wasted the company time, I’ve taken advantage of a small business and used them (partly because I planned on still attending the Christmas party), I’m not a team player and that I expected too much too soon from the role. He said I should feel bad for leaving my colleague (also sales/admin) to now do two jobs over Christmas. And that it’s bad to have done this during their busiest period.

I gave in my notice on Monday and the whole week has been so unpleasant. My manager is being really curt and quite frankly nasty to me. I spoke to my team mates (who i still obviously don’t know that well!) and some of them agreed that what I did was fine, but my colleague in sales is obviously upset because I’m leaving her to pick up extra work over xmas.

She use to be very judgemental when we were younger but of course as we’ve grown up, she’s been a lot less judgemental. 

She still says little things about other people that make me side eye her but aside from that, she’s cool and we have a good time hanging out whenever she comes to visit every few months. Now, she has always been big on people leaving their home town and how there’s more to life than (our hometown). I definitely understand leaving your hometown to experience another city so I do agree with her. I’ve been living in my hometown this entire time, but that’s only because I got a job with a government agency that requires me to stay put for a few years. If it wasn’t for this job, I would’ve left as soon as I finished grad school.

My friend knows that my job requires me to stay for at least another year but at one point she would ask me every time she comes home to visit, about when I’m planning to leave. I give her the whole spiel about my job and mention how I plan to leave after my probationary period is done. It started to get annoyed with her constantly inquiring about when I’m going to leave our home town especially when I’ve answered the question before. Her job just sent her on a work assignment to the west coast and when we met up last week she started going on her tangents about how happy she is that she left her hometown and how people NEED to get out of their hometown in order to grow blah blah 

I’m truly happy for her but apart of me feels like she’s judging me for still living here. Not to brag but I have a pretty good job with the government and I don’t plan to just up and leave just to say I moved out of my hometown.

Her sister often discusses what boundaries she should have since we found out we were having our son 3 years ago. 

The main issue comes from the fact that my brother’s (21) girlfriend, Zara, gave birth to my niece (3) around the same time our son was born so they are only a couple months apart. Zara’s dad is really the only family she has and he has been family friend for quite a while and works quite often, so my mom is kind of mother figure for her. 

My wife has a problem with the closeness my mom has with my niece, says it isn’t fair on my son that my mom sees my niece so often. I know his girlfriend visits most days and vice versa for company and what not and i tried to tell her that it’s because my brother’s girlfriend doesn’t really have anyone else. 

My wife’s sister was over yesterday and they were talking about how crazy they thought it was that my mom was in the hospital room when my niece was born. Lucy started making passive aggressive comments about both Zara and my mom, about how they probably did it in spite of my wife having strict boundaries (I should add that it was an extremely traumatic birth and my brother did not cope well). 

I argued that point and said that she wasn’t just there for Zara, but for him too and said that she can’t place boundaries that affect the closeness of my her and mom and call the outcome of said boundaries favoritism because my mom chooses to respect those boundaries. Lucy started to get angry at me defending them and said that Zara should have those same boundaries and she doesn’t have them out of spite for my wife having them. The argument just kept going round and round in circles and I told her that she’s projecting her own issues with her in-laws on to my family since no one in my family has made problems with my wife’s boundaries and she left early literally storming out of our house shouting about how I must have a perfect family then and that I must be the one that has issues with my wife placing boundaries because I said that is the reason why Zara sees my mom more often and it’s got nothing to do with spite. 

My wife continued to argue with me after asking how I can defend them when they are favoring my niece over my own son but in my eyes that is not true. I bring my son to visit my mom as often as i can and I know she loves him just as much and would spend more time with him if she could.

Long story short, he asked how and I told him, and he got upset, and he still is bothered I let the guy pay for the gas. Since we've been together, there's been a handful of times I've let men pay for my stuff, which I told my husband about then and there.

These men, obviously, mean nothing to me. I never initiate flirting with the guys and beyond smiling and making conversation politely, I don't flirt back.

It's just money and a way to flip the switch and get free things out of it. I only have eyes for my husband and want no one else.

And a while ago he picked up on a favourite joke from it. You know how in Bart Gets An Elephant at one point Stampy destroys one side of the house and Bart’s only response is “Look. He thinks he’s people.”? My dad decided he loves that joke and started using it all the time.

At first it was just on our cat whenever he jumped up on the dinner table and/or did something resembling what a person would do, like ‘typing’ on the computer. But he soon started using it for other pets even when the owners didn’t want it.

And recently he started using it for actual people. He would look at my baby cousins and say “Look. They think they’re people! Isn’t it cute?” My aunts and uncles and pretty much the whole family do not want him saying this about us, but he will not stop.

Last night, we saw a photo of me in preschool and he said “Look, you were so cute, you think you’re people!” And that was the last straw.

I told him, deadly serious, that I did not like or appreciate the joke, it had stopped being funny long ago, nobody else found it funny, and he needed to know when to draw the line. He kept joking for a while when I was talking, not knowing I was being serious, and then he went quiet.

We were watching Home Alone 2 at the time, and when the first traps came around I noticed Dad wasn’t laughing like he usually was. I asked if something was wrong and he said in a very sad tone ‘I just don’t know what I can laugh at anymore.’

Since then, I have felt guilty about it and wondered if I could have told him in a gentler and less sudden way that the joke wasn’t funny and was getting downright demeaning.

A while back, I saw that this girl, let’s call her X for short, had often been sitting alone on the bleachers. I invited her to sit with me and my friends and from then on she has been my best friend.

That was until recently, when I met some of my new friends! I really like these people, and I can be myself around them, unlike when around X. I am X’s only friend at our school, so she started sitting with me and my new friends at lunch.  This was great until our group started to do things outside of school. Whenever X comes with to almost any activity, I have to parent her. I don’t have any fun anymore with my friends because X just expects me to constantly be with her.  I feel like I’m being a bad friend but I wish she would understand that she isn’t my only friend, and even at lunch she will just interrupt my conversations with other friends to talk about herself. It’s annoying and I am constantly feeling mad at her but have to hold it in as to not hurt her feelings. It’s hard to see her as a friend anymore when she ruins all of the fun walks and shopping trips I could’ve enjoyed. I’ve tried hinting to her that I don’t want to spend all of my time with her, and i’d like to be around my other friends too but she doesn’t understand.

This is why recently, I’ve been waiting for X to leave and then suggesting meetups with my friends.  She is not close to any of my friends either, so it’s not like I’m ruining their friendship with each other. However, Iam close to her mom.  Her mom is my piano teacher who I really love and also a close friend of my parents. X is one of those girls who tells her mom everything, so I’m sure she would tell her mom as soon as she gets home and cause lots of drama!! This is the reason i’ve been so stressed about this because our relationship as friends feels so forced at this point I just don’t feel comfortable. I like having the ability to easily leave a relationship if it gets toxic, but the responsibility of always making sure she feels okay and never stepping out of line and saying something inappropriate around her is really taking a toll on my mental health.

My Bf and I decided to go to a nightclub (We're on a work break atm and a on a trip up north) on the weekend. He was a bit late. I sat at one of the tables, opposite me were a couple who looked in their early 40s. I was a little drunk just to note and we started chatting and it was an excellent chat. ""They"" were really interesting and entertaining to talk too. My boyfriend arrived and we continued chatting. I can't remember if I asked for their names but I definitely gave them mine. They did mention they were in their 50s which surprised me a lot. Last I remember of them was them dancing and kissing each other.

The next evening, I was thinking about the night before and something seeming off about that couple. I had a look on the socials of the nightclub and they had some photos showing couples who attended. Found that couple and it was my fucking parents. I was completely stunned, wondering why they didn't recognize me or if they did, didn't say anything and how I didn't even recognize them. I also maybe remember 80% of the chat.

I called my Dad and cut straight to the chase and asked him about that night. He admitted it was him and my mum that night but said that he just didn't recognize me.

I asked him why didn't he say anything and this is what he replied with ""You know the last thing I wanted was to make that night awkward for my WIFE (raised his voice) by getting into arguments with our estranged daughter on our birthday""(my parents share the same birthday which I completely forgot). I asked him since when did they get back together and why. He said it's none of my business. I called him selfish and ignorant for not saying anything or at least  giving me a simple answer and he replied that I should ""grow up"" and that he'll see me on Christmas if I want to vent at them before hanging up rudely.

I was still really on edge by this and mentally all over the place. I had no clue in the slightest my parents would even be thinking about getting back together (I did notice, at a family wedding earlier this year, they seemed close while dancing but thought nothing off it).

Now, the thing is, I didn't owe him any money, nor did I have any money to give him to begin with at the time. My mother was diagnosed with cancer a year ago, and while me and my sister take care of my mother in rotation, I'm pretty much the forefront of providing for her financially.   


One day, said friend ( his name is Alex) asked for $50, and I told him I didn't have the money to give him due to me paying my rent early (which I always make a habit of doing when I'm in a bind or in the aforementioned situation of taking care of my mother) and other personal reasons. He basically assumed we weren't cool anymore, due to me not giving him the requested money, and claimed that we gave each other money all the time, when the only valid time he gave me money was when I needed my Adobe CC renewed, and I paid him back immediately once he asked for his favor (I even have the CashApp receipts for both exchanges). Then, I was telling him that I had informed him of my personal situation regarding the events surrounding me having to take care of my mother, and of the mental break she had when she attacked me due to paranoia and other circumstances surrounding her health at the time. So, him assuming I did have the money was totally invalid given the circumstances. 

Then, he proceeded to go on a spill about how ""the world doesn't revolve around me"", when I've pretty much been handling the situation for the majority by myself and with the help of my eldest sister. He also assumed that everything I literally told him leading up to this point was ""made up"" and that I tell him a lot of things. As a ""friend"" even though I wasn't speaking to a number of close friends due to what was going on, I ALWAYS had everyone in the loop as to why I was absent, or why I didn't have this that and the third. It even got to a point I had to seek emergency rental assistance from my county to stay afloat, which further justifies me not having the money at the time to give Al. If I had it, I would have given it to him, no sweat. I just hate that he ended our friendship, knowing of my personal circumstance, and he can virtually twist it any way he wants to with others.

I don’t mind people parking there if they ask first, because you never know when I might need the other spot. Each unit has the number of spots that their condo has bedrooms (2 bedrooms, 2 spots). I have lived here for over a year and never had a continuous issue with my spot being used. They are labeled with your unit number so it is super easy to find the right spots and there are also two areas of unmarked/guest parking that are never full. About two weeks ago, I noticed a small car parked in my second spot so when they left I moved my car into that spot. My logic was “nobody would park in a spot right in front of my door because it’s not theirs, right?” Well I was wrong because that night a huge truck parked in the spot outside my door and didn’t move until the next night. I left a kind note asking them to not park in my second spot just in case I needed it but they can just ask me to use it and I’ll let them. I’ll admit here that I probably put myself in that situation because I moved to prevent the small car from using the second spot. A few days after this, I noticed this truck kept coming back and backing into my second spot.

M and BD divorced 5 yrs ago. M and SD married about 3 yrs ago.

 

M and BD never had the best relationship and IMO were together for far too long. But BD had always been my best friend. It was always he and I from day 1. I was his favorite person. This pretty much changed when I hit puberty and started wanting to date. He got super disappointed in me and backed off a lot. I was constantly a problem in his eyes. He also decieded I'd be “woman of the house” and was expected to do ALL the chores of the house with M. Us being women, it was our job to cook, clean, serve him, do his laundry. Then when M and him divorced, he expected me to live in his house, get a job to take care of him and to continue to do the chores for him. He got upset that I had gotten engaged and instead moved in with my fiancé. He was ALSO mad that I refused to agree with him that M was a horrible evil person who screwed him over. Instead, I would tell him I don’t want to talk about either to the other in any bad way. He strongly disliked this and wanted me to instead be his personal therapist. (Yes on top of EVERYTHING, he wanted me to also solve all his emotional problems because ""who else am i supposed to talk to.”) When I koved out to start my life, he pretty much just cut me off. No phone calls, no texts, nothing. My gma has me text him for holidays and his birthday (which I only do for her because I can’t say no to her. It means so much that I do this), and it's just radio silence.

SD, on the other hand, has always been there for me since he came into my life. He has always been there for my fiance and I through all our troubles, helped M to let my fiance into her life, and has helped her grow so much into the person she is today. He has been everything for us. I'm so happy to have him and he is everything I could ask for in a father. I've called him dad since him and M started dating. I could never see anyone better for our family.

The problem is I'm looking to get married and I want SD to walk me down the aisle. From the actions BD has presented, I don't feel he has the right to give me away anymore. M said I need to just compromise and tell him I want them both to walk me down the aisle because ""they're both your dad's and that's the right thing to do,"" but I don't even want to do that. I don't want him to have the honor. He lost that a long time ago. SD has loved and supported me and been my rock for years and is the only man I see who deserves to hand me away.

So my question is WIBTA if I just had SD walk me and told him to essentially shove it since he's shown I mean practically nothing to him?

TLDR: BD has basically ditched me and SD has been more of a dad. I want SD to walk me down the aisle at my wedding.

We’ve been together 20 years and I wouldn’t change her for the world. However the last 2-3 years she’s started complaining and picking fault with me a lot. It started off as little things but has gradually gotten to practically everything I do. Just taking yesterday for example, she picked fault with the route I took her to work, it’s the same route she’s taken for the 15 years she’s worked there. She came home from work and picked fault at how I cleaned the house, saying she can tell I’ve done something different (I hadn’t). She said the pasta was too cold and the sauce too hot (the pasta was nowhere near cold). I’d given the dog too much food. I’d given the cat too little food. I had left a light on the stove hood. I had put on weight again. She then went on to say I’m too muscly and not cuddly enough anymore. You get the point. She literally has to come home and do nothing but still complains. 



One of the complains that gets me the most is she always criticises the wet clothes that I put out on the radiators to dry. She’ll always say I do it wrong and rearrange it. Last night it annoyed me so much I came up with a plan. I secretly filmed her rearranging the clothes and then tonight when I got home from work I put the same clothes on a quick spin so they would be wet and put them back exactly how she rearranged them. 



An hour later she came home from work and straight away picker fault with how I had hung them and asked how I expected them to dry that way and how useless I am. I got out my phone and shown her the video and said “I followed your instructions to the letter”. 



Mate, she went mad! Called me all sorts of schemers and manipulators and back stabbing this and that etc etc. Our daughter caught wind of what was happening and came out of her room to say she agrees with me and all my wife does is criticise me for no reason and she ruins every night with her moaning. 



My wife got her stuff and went to storm out the house but before she left I told her I’ve brought this up to her many times before and she’s never listened so I had to show her how infuriating she is. She told me she was just trying “to teach you how to do things correctly” and I said “no you’ve just turned in to a joyless nag who wants everything her own way and even then she isn’t happy” to which she replied “no that’s just how women get at a certain age” and I replied admittedly far to harshly “wasn’t your mum 39 when your dad left? I’m starting to see why”. I haven’t heard from her since and I feel bad but still justified. 



I have tried to bring this up to her so many times. I’m not lying when I say probably 50 times and she doesn’t even lie and say she’ll change, she just flat out sees nothing wrong with how she acts so I had to try and show her.

I tried confronting him multiple times about all of this and asking him what was up, to which he brushed it all off and said nothing was wrong.

Flash forward to last night, I make a big dinner and invite my friend over to eat with my roommate and I. We're all at the table about to start eating when my roommate pulls out his speaker and puts on Swedish Pagans on full volume. We kept asking him to stop or turn it down but he wouldn't. After a while I had to take the speaker from him and turn it off.

I asked him why he was doing all this and he finally said it was because I was humming the song too much. He said he counted 63 times that I hummed it over the last week. I didn't even realize this and told him I wished he would have just told me directly. He said that it should be ""common sense"" that I realize this is annoying. I told him I would stop humming and singing the song completely.

The next day, he keeps playing the song outside my room. I confront him about it and he said he wants to make me understand why it's so annoying that I kept humming this song around him. All this after I said I would stop and I had no idea it bothered him.

Then BF and I got a puppy. BIL is a weed dealer who has a mild learning disability that made him take 8 years to complete university. During that time everything was paid for, his mother even payed for his own apartment with Younger Brother while he took one class per semester as they agreed she’d pay his rent while he was studying.

For years I watched as BIL has disrespected everyone, called his mom a c*nt after damaging her bike and when he was about to get kicked out, managed to talk his way into FIL paying for a 6-month trip to Ireland and back to Canada, dealt drugs out of MILs basement, and more. 

Six months before we got a dog, my BF’s family boxers both passed away very close together. My BF had spent a better part of his adult life taking care of them. BIL only took care of the younger dog during her last few months. When we got our puppy, I asked BF if he’d like for me to ask his brothers if he could have one dog toy for our new puppy. I texted YB not thinking it would be a big deal. He texted me he would see with BIL. Next thing BF is getting texts from BIL saying im rude and that it’s not my place to ask for HIS belongings and that he wasn’t giving us toys. I tried to explain that I was asking for BF.

Then we had a get together at BF’s family cabin. BIL crashed and ate a bunch of food and never helped clean. I spent an hour doing dishes and BIL comes with cups and just puts them in front of me once I finished. I wanted to be nice so I let this go. He’s also racist.

Another time BIL comes by stays over late. He has some weed so I ask if he could sell me some to help me sleep. He says no, he doesn’t have a scale. I say no problem, we actually have a scale! He says no, he doesn’t want to sell. He hangs out for another hour and I’m really feeling like I’m not going to sleep so I ask him if he’s sure, I don’t mind overpaying. He leaves and the next day is texting my BF that I’m a fiend and he’s still mad about me asking for the dog toys and wants to back out of business. At this point, we had spent a lot of time planning which had taken me and BF away from our other business that made money. I was livid. Fast forward to now and I haven’t seen or spoken to him. 

BF and BIL made up six months ago. BF asked BIL If he was ever going to apologize to me. BIL lied to BF and said he texted me but didn’t. 

Now I’m 13 weeks pregnant, wildly emotional, mostly angry. Monday, BF comes to me and says he has “annoying” news: BIL is moving next door. I lost it. I apparently told BF to leave. We made up on Tuesday. It turns out BIL was moving in that Monday. His apartment is 20 feet away.

I don’t want BIL to have anything to do with me or my baby. He’s a horrible influence but everyone seems to think that he’s changed. If he were considerate he would have let us know before he moved. BFs whole family knows about my breakdown and thinks I should get over it.

I don’t look at my snaps first when I open my phone, it’s usually my phone number messaging. I text him normally after my shift, saving to look at the snaps I got later and go home.

At home, I get a few things done with my family before finally sitting in my room to wrap my boyfriends gifts for Christmas. I sit down while I work, finally open my snaps, and I see a snap from my boyfriend of his signing for the house. I congratulate him, ask if he’s excited, but he responds saying that he’s sad his own girlfriend didn’t support him today, that no one else needed a snap to remember about the signing, and that he assumed that someone who cared about him realized how important this moment was for him. I start apologizing PROFUSELY, I apologize for forgetting, for not looking at my snaps, I apologize for him being mad at me. I’ve been left on delivered for HOURS, I tried calling him after my shift today but he put me straight to voicemail.

No big deal, but then it's lost in the mail and was deliver 12 days from date of purchase. 
When I got it though, the box was mangled, they used an old padded envelope with the item stuffed in there and they didn't tape the small flat rate box shut. The ends were just folded shut. There was stickers on the box saying ""Received unsealed"". 
Now upon inspection of the item, it's bent and unusable. It's a thick steel object so it took real force to bend it. 
The seller doesn't want to refund me until I ship the item back and they have it in possession as they say they need the item for a USPS claim.

I understand damage in transit happens though and cost to ship is minor, but I highly believe damage would not have occurred if the box was taped shut.

We love our kids more than anything, but there are days we are just trying to stay afloat. My wife sometimes finds herself extremely stressed.

My mom also had three kids. I'm sure she had her own internal struggles, but she was really chill and everything just seemed smooth and easy for her. To be honest i have no idea how she did it, but she always looked good, dinner was always on the table, and we behaved in public. Objectivity she had even less support than my wife as my father wanted nothing to do with us. I hardly saw him and I'm pretty sure he had a girlfriend in an apartment somewhere 

This isn't to compare them at all, but I think it explains why my mom can be impatient or snarky with us. We obviously don't live up to her standards. Her attitude has pissed me off for a while. She doesn't even say much but we can just tell that she thinks we are failing.

Recently my wife had a breakdown in front of the family and began to cry over how bad she thought she looked in a family picture. I immidiatley tried to comfort her, but she was distraught and the rest of the family was standing around awkwardly. 

I could hear my mom, dad, and dad's wife talking in the background and my dad's wife jokingly said my mom should help out and babysit. My mom rolled her eyes and said why should she. She never had a babysitter with us yet found time for self care, hobbies, and multiple affairs. Ok I was going to internally roll my eyes and let that one go, but then I heard my mom mutter ""I don't know if it is stupidity or laziness, but she needs to get it together. It isn't even this hard, the hell, you are going to cry about it?""

I snapped and demanded she repeat it. My mom did make a face like oh shit, but said if I was yelling i obviously heard her. I called her a bitch and told her to get out. My wife told her to go fuck herself and maybe it would make her less uptight which I laughed at. I told my mom that she needs to leave and can only come back if she apologizes on her knees. That is the only way I will truly believe she is sorry, as she tends to give shitty apologizes while smirking or giggling. My mom yelled at me that I was delusional and claims my wife is exhausting and the whole family hates her.

My mom is now banned and I'm dead serious about the kneeling. She claims it's fine and she will just never come.

I F(49) advertised looking for a responsible adult female who was friendly and wouldn't mind being companionable to take over the finished basement in my rented house. She assumed she could move in two weeks early and I just let it happen, but she never offered the payment we agreed on (first month, last month, and half the heating oil for fill up which should last maybe 2 or 3 months depending on the cold). 

I finally asked about the money, which is hard for me to, to be told she would need to pay over time because yadda yadda yadda. I should have just booted her right then and there but she was helpful and nice and friendly and I believe in giving folks a chance. I honestly believe she's not a bad person but our lifestyles are incompatible if she has zero empathy or regard for how her bad decisions have consequences for other people.

But then the little things crept in. I had to nag for the money, I had to remind her about house rules (she has a cat, not allowed in some parts of the basement but she ignored that rule). She leaves lights on when she leaves a room and I'm a conservative type person who recycles and shuts the faucet off when I brush my teeth. She eats off paper plates and makes more garbage in a day than I do in a week. 

There were just a lot of incompatible things but the killer was when, instead of paying what she owed, she went out for a night on the town. She is still, after living here since October 15, not caught up with what she owes, and I can't bankroll her. For her to just assume that I would cover her rent and utilities is just beyond the pale and something I would never do to someone, particularly a basic stranger!  I need her to leave and I feel horrible, but I just can't trust her and it's causing massive anxiety, making my dog, in turn, have symptoms of anxiety too. 

Tonight I confronted her and told her I need her out by Dec 31st to avoid having to pay January rent, but if she couldn't do it, I'd need January even if she moved out mid-month. I told her I'd help find her a place, but she needs to start now.

Every so often, he comes to stay the weekend. I honestly wouldn't mind this if he wasn't such an immature slob.

First, I need to address that my roommate can also be quite messy. When the two of them are here together, it feels like my personal hell. I already have enough of a hassle cleaning up after her all the time. When her boyfriend comes down to visit, he will leave food wrappers laying around and (the worst of anything he does) pisses all over the toilet seat and sometimes even the floor, leaving it there for me to find and wipe it up. I don't think it's right that an 18 year old man expects others to clean up his bodily fluids.

I have talked to him about it, asking him why he struggles so much with this because it seems like any time he goes to the bathroom, there is spilt pee. He told me that he doesn't hold his \*thing\* while he pees. WTH?? On another occasion (yes, it has happened quite a bit), I asked him nicely to wipe it up if he makes a mess.

Secondly, the last time he was here, he used all the ice cubes in my own ice trays and didn't even bother to fill at least one of them back up. He shouldn't be touching them anyways because his girlfriend has her own, but even if he was going to use mine, he could have at least had the decency to fill it up.

The reason I think I might be an asshole is because I also have a boyfriend who is here at our college. I have him over here all the time, and I do feel a bit bad because LDR's are hard and I hope I don't rub my relationship in her face. I never show any type of affection when we are around her because I don't want to make her upset since I know she misses her boyfriend. However, my boyfriend has never ONCE left trash for my roommate to deal with, leave piss on the toilet seat or floor that she would ultimately have to wipe up, or use her own personal stuff. I understand that she wants her boyfriend to come over, but I wish she had one who was competent and mature.

She is on her way back now from picking him up for the weekend, and all I wish was that she would have just stayed home with him instead. It's not like there is anything going on here this weekend anyways.

He was young and pretty healthy and nobody ever would have expected it or seen it coming. I was absolutely torn apart and devastated by the loss. He was the single most important person in my life for a large stretch of time (four years as friends, 2.5 as a boyfriend, then another 1.5 as my best friend again). We were dealt hard cards and didn't know how to support eachother through some of our issues, which is why we broke up, but we stayed in contact and always made it clear that we would never stop loving and caring about the other. I have a lot of regrets about the situation that I'll have to live with forever. 

I went to his funeral, out of state, and was blown away by the love and comfort his friends and family gave me, despite the breakup and how complicated we always were I'll never forget how much they helped me through it and how supported they made me feel. 

Even now, I'm not over it. I don't think I'll ever be over it. How could I ever? 

The issue: his closest family, who I will forever be grateful for, have invited me to stay at a cabin in his favorite place to celebrate his first birthday since he died. I just don't think I can do it. It feels so selfish but I've only recently come to a point where I can get through a day without breaking down (haven't made it through a night yet), and I just don't know if I'm ready to be around his friends and family and hold it together. This is strange but one of the things holding me back is that his brother, who is 3 years older, looks exactly like him (except a height difference). When I was at his parents house after the funeral there was a moment when he walked out of the bathroom and I swore it was my ex and I still have nightmares of how it felt to realize it wasn't him. I don't know if I'm explaining this correctly. The point is that it just feels so...hard. 

I plan to send his mom a card and maybe some flowers around the anniversary, but I think for my mental health it makes more sense to decline. 

My sister and the one friend that I've told about this say that I'm being incredibly rude to his family by choosing not to go for those reasons, and that I essentially need to suck it up. Now I'm even more conflicted. WIBTA?

My dad (57M) cheated and my mum walked away. She wasn't able to cope with the divorce and she left me with my nan and moved to another city for work. Over the years we made amends and although I live miles away from her, we do speak on the phone a few times a week.

It was another story with my dad. He also moved away when I was 3. Never put in effort to see me. He was hardly ever around. He proceeded to have 2 other daughters from 2 different women.

Just before the pandemic kicked off, he phoned me drunk one day and started saying hurtful things such as 'Your mum also abandoned you, you're taking it out all on me. I'm sick of you treating me like shite. I don't deserve this.' I told him not to phone me ever again and went no contact.

He messaged me in August saying his mum (89F) died. Growing up I saw my nan only a handful of times and of course I felt bad for someone passing away but I didn't really lose sleep over it. Sent him a quick message saying I was sorry to hear the news and wished him peace and comfort. It was the only communication I sent him over the last 3 years.

He then started sending me info for funeral but I didn't attend.

For the last 3 months, I've been harassed by his entire family. I have 3 aunts and many cousins that I never even met in my life. Every single day I receive messages about how horrible I am for not speaking with my father, even during the most difficult time of his life after he lost his mother. Apparently he is also going through some serious health problems.

Of course these messages make me feel horrible but I've always felt confident in my decision of not wanting anything to do with my dad or his family. However, a few friends recently commented that I was being cold by refusing to get in touch, particularly now he has health problems and that I should 'forget and forgive' and I'd regret if he died.

A while back, I saw that this girl, let’s call her X for short, had often been sitting alone on the bleachers. I invited her to sit with me and my friends and from then on she has been my best friend.

That was until recently, when I met some of my new friends! I really like these people, and I can be myself around them, unlike when around X. I am X’s only friend at our school, so she started sitting with me and my new friends at lunch.  This was great until our group started to do things outside of school. Whenever X comes with to almost any activity, I have to parent her. I don’t have any fun anymore with my friends because X just expects me to constantly be with her.  I feel like I’m being a bad friend but I wish she would understand that she isn’t my only friend, and even at lunch she will just interrupt my conversations with other friends to talk about herself. It’s annoying and I am constantly feeling mad at her but have to hold it in as to not hurt her feelings. It’s hard to see her as a friend anymore when she ruins all of the fun walks and shopping trips I could’ve enjoyed. I’ve tried hinting to her that I don’t want to spend all of my time with her, and i’d like to be around my other friends too but she doesn’t understand.

This is why recently, I’ve been waiting for X to leave and then suggesting meetups with my friends.  She is not close to any of my friends either, so it’s not like I’m ruining their friendship with each other. However, Iam close to her mom.  Her mom is my piano teacher who I really love and also a close friend of my parents. X is one of those girls who tells her mom everything, so I’m sure she would tell her mom as soon as she gets home and cause lots of drama!! This is the reason i’ve been so stressed about this because our relationship as friends feels so forced at this point I just don’t feel comfortable. I like having the ability to easily leave a relationship if it gets toxic, but the responsibility of always making sure she feels okay and never stepping out of line and saying something inappropriate around her is really taking a toll on my mental health.

After I hung up I texted “you turn around &amp; call me a hoe? Me?” Then he says “don’t take it to head but you said something wrong, what you said goes against who you are, who I know you as. Just own up, simple” then when I call him back crying he goes “arg” &amp; hangs up, I call again he says “I don’t have the energy for this”, shouts at me that my words are of a hoe if I heard him call me a hoe then that’s how I take it then hangs up again.

I call again &amp; remind him of the times he’s told me to watch how I say things to him because his brother makes him feel like a fool so I shouldn’t do the same but then he says what he says to me then apologies &amp; says “but” then I hung up. He didn’t call me then I called again and said “what were you saying” then he tells me “call me when you’ve calmed down, I can’t hear you” then after crying while on the phone I hung up &amp; he hasn’t even texted me since.

In general this is a relationship where I have to beg, cry &amp; plead with him to apologise to me. And had I said the words to him “those are the words of a fool” he would’ve hung up, deleted my number and would’ve just ghosted me because he told me that there’s no need to break up with me, just ghosting is what’s sufficent.

However, after my son's death being around Jess reminded me of what I just lost… At the time her daughter just turned 1, and she was pregnant with her second child.

The period of time following our son’s death was incredibly difficult. I struggled with mental health, I lost my job (layoffs), Jon and I weren’t talking and even separated for a while; I blamed myself for everything. Eventually Jon and I reconciled and decided that we wanted to move as soon as we were able to.

Jess and I had a falling out over this, she tried to convince me to stay… Basically, she said if I left, it meant that I was choosing Jon over everyone, especially her. I couldn’t stand to be around her and her perfect family anymore; and it felt like she didn’t even care about the son that I lost, which I told her. She said she hated me, and I told her I never wanted to see her again.

Anyways, Jon and I moved, and I only kept in touch with my mom. Jon and I worked things out in counseling, I found a new job, and we reached the “light at the end of the tunnel” so to speak. Then the other day (after more than two years of not speaking) Jess reached out to me and apologized for the way that we left things off. We made up and talked for hours. 

The next day she called again and asked if we wanted to come visit our parents and her family and offered to pay for our plane tickets if I said yes. I told her that I would have to ask Jon and see when we were free, I would have to get back to her about it… but I told her that I would be happy to visit if we could make the arrangements. She was thrilled.

When I talked to Jon about Jess’s offer, he said he would love to see everyone, and we found dates that we are free close to those that she had suggested. All I had to do was call her back. We were both excited.

Later that night, I had a bad anxiety/PTSD episode. A lot of memories and emotions that I thought I worked through resurfaced. It got to a where I had to wake up Jon, which I hate doing, but I was spiraling uncontrollably. This made me realize that it isn’t a good idea to see everyone, especially Jess and the kids, because I’m not doing as well mentally as I thought I was.

The thing is, I can see Jess being upset that I reject her offer now, because I know that this is her way of extending an olive branch, and I pretty much said yes already. Also, I know that if I tell her “I’m not ready to see you and your family” it is going to sound like “I’m still mad at you.” Even though I could realistically soldier through visiting family and probably be fine, I’m not sure if it is worth the risk.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4847755,public,top,self,WIBTA if I didn’t visit my family after getting my sister's hope's up?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zayyoh/wibta_if_i_didnt_visit_my_family_after_getting_my/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

The youngest (17F) and I especially, my Mom had a very traumatic life and has issues with alcohol and relationships which meant that growing up I had a lot of responsibility for my younger siblings. She is a single mother and had her own business which meant I would finish school, come home and feed/bath/put to bed the two youngest and help the others with home/housework etc. 

I moved out at 18 but have always been there for the younger ones as my Mom went through a string of abusive relationships, the last one she is currently divorcing after he kicked the shit out of her in front of my two youngest siblings. It was the final straw after 3 years of physical, mental and financial abuse from him, not all just directed at my Mom. 

I love my Mom and try to support her as much as I feel is appropriate, speaking to schools when the youngest gets in trouble, contributing to her mortgage and just giving all of them advice and someone to talk to when they need it. They’re not overly generous with recognising it but that’s not why I do it, however in this situation it’s kind of important. 

I moved to a big city about 5 years ago and live with my partner (35M) who loves all my family and treats them as though they’re his own sisters. We’ve made sure they know they can come and stay with us whenever they need some space, or just to treat them to the kind of culture they don’t get back home. We want to show them that by working hard at school they can gain freedom to live, work and explore wherever they like. 

Now here’s the problem. My youngest sister ‘Daisy’ has visited a lot, and usually for at least a week at a time. I work from home 3 days a week so typically she’ll just chill out watching tv or playing online then we’ll do things in the evening, and I’ll take a day or two off to sightsee or go shopping. She is a little nervous about travelling around on her own so this time we suggested she bring a friend with her so they could use the bus to properly explore the City. 

From the first day she was a nightmare. She was upset we didn’t meet her at the station (a 10 min walk from our house) to carry her bags. Then she stayed up until 6am vaping in the living room, falling asleep with all the windows open and leaving the house freezing, after I’d asked her to only vape in her room if not outside. Her and her friend spent the whole week sleeping until 5pm, ordering fast food and then staying up until 6/7am and playing YouTube loudly in the room next to where we were sleeping. 

I didn’t lose my temper, I just spoke to her and reiterated the house rules pointing out it wasn’t fair for them to do this (&amp; leaving shit everywhere) particularly as me and my partner were working during the day. I had given them cash on the condition they use it to explore the city, they spent it on vapes and McDonald’s.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4847751,public,top,self,AITA to not buy my sister Xmas gifts?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zayxy4/aita_to_not_buy_my_sister_xmas_gifts/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

They have been together around 2 months at this point.

I met her 3 days ago, and my dad said that I should invite her on Christmas Day for dinner as I will be hosting this year for the first time in mine and my partners new home. The plan was for myself, my partner, mum, dad and two brothers to be here.

The bottom line is that neither myself or my partner feel comfortable inviting her, as we barely know her. I have nothing against her, but in our first home together I want a small family get together and I haven't even invited some close family members. I have been told she doesn't see her mum (childhood problems) and her siblings will be going there, so she will be on her own. I do know however she has her dad who lives in the area. 

I should mention that prior to meeting her, I had spoken to my brother on the phone about Christmas Day and had said I would be happy for him to take a dinner back to her as I was sure there would be loads. She was happy with this. 

After telling my parents this, my dad has now said that he is going to feel uncomfortable having this conversation with them as he knows they will want to spend Christmas Day together. I told him I had already spoken to them about Christmas, so unless they have mentioned to them that they would ask me about her coming then there shouldn't be a problem. This was neither confirmed nor denied, but I expect they have had some discussions as they have stayed with them the last few nights. 

My dad made a snide remark that he should get to do what he wants on Christmas Day too, and then suggested that they did Christmas at their small caravan. I said that the plan has been to come to mine so why is this now suddenly changing? We had already established that since they had downsized this year,  it would make sense to come to our house as we had the room to facilitate dinner. I'm also confused as this was a decision we made together, so why wouldn't this be what he wanted to do? I also got ""nobody should be alone at Christmas"" and ""you wouldn't want to be alone"".

I just feel I shouldn't have to accommodate somebody I don't know. What has she done for the last 20 Christmas's of her life? That may sound harsh but brother has only known her a short period of time. Whilst I can understand a honeymoon stage in a relationship and not wanting to leave eachother's sides, I don't want random people in my home. I would also be understanding if my brother doesn't want to come, and would still ensure they would have a dinner as I'd like to think i'm not a bad person.

We’ve been together for 6 years, have a home and raise my 8 year old daughter together. I intentionally did not extend a wedding invite to my family. While my fiancé’s family is warm and over-the-moon for us, my family dynamic is different. Very toxic. My family has been awful and cold to my partner since day 1 and routinely tell me “they love me but marriage is between a man and a woman” and say “my lifestyle” is wrong. I’m a Christian too,  but not *that* kind of “Christian.” For many reasons, I put boundaries in place and put a lot of distance in place. It hurts my heart. My family (who it seems couldn’t care less about me) reached out and asked to come to my wedding, which feels less about me and more about their own entitlement. I spoke with one of my sisters who won’t allow my niece and nephew to attend because she “wants them to stand strong in their faith.” Mind you, they are 9 and 4 and adore me. I told her that I don’t have room at my wedding for people who find me unacceptable. I’m thinking of telling my mom and 2 other sisters the same. It’s weighing on me. There is so much that is unresolved, really horrible things that happened and were said, they think awful things about my fiancé for no reason as she’s been nothing but graceful to them. They blame her for “separating me from them” and don’t realize I made the choice to pull back because of how they have treated us, among other reasons. Still I feel awful for not letting them come.

Previously, I had met his grandmother and knew that when she came to visit it would be a bit hectic, but not unreasonable for me to handle. A month ago, she came up with his grandfather to help clean our apartment. It started out nice, she bought me lunch, and I helped her clean the common areas of the apartment during the day. But later in the day she started going off on my friend for how messy our apartment was (she told us NOT to clean it before she got there because, ""we wouldn't do it right"").

The next day of the weekend visit, she wouldn't tell us what time in the morning she was coming over, and since I had already helped with the common areas in the apartment, I decided to just sleep until around noon like I usually do on weekends. I woke up, they finished cleaning up my friend's bedroom, and we went to lunch. When we got back to the apartment, my friend's grandmother arranged for me to have a one-on-one talk with her. During this talk it started out with her going off on how my friend has no life skills, and then it turned to me. She straight up told me that I need to lose weight, that I am ridiculous for sleeping in until noon on Sunday, and that I am being a baby about my own personal depression issues. I never did ask for an opinion from her.

During finals week my friend has his finals at the beginning of the week, and the plan was originally that his mom was going to come and clean the apartment while he was going to take his finals, and then head home with her. All my finals are at the end of the week after my friend leaves, but I was fine with this since his mom would be out of my way. A few weeks ago, his mom started having some moderate health issues, and she said that it is likely she would be unable to travel. Instead, the only alternative is that his grandmother comes for three days alone, and that she would clean.

I have a huge problem with this because his grandmother cannot mind her own business. I am sort of predicting she will be in my face too while in the apartment, and mess up my sleep schedule. It is already a really stressful time, and this isn’t helping.

My friend agrees with everything I am saying and has talked to his mother saying how I have felt about all this, and she says there is nothing she can do. He also talked to his grandmother himself who once again said I was a baby being upset about this, that I need to grow up, and she's trying to help me. I told my friend to tell her that unless she wants to pay my rent for me, she does not get to dictate my living habits.

Although, I guess that she wouldn’t wake me up, since she didn’t do so last time, and that I should be thankful she’s cleaning my living space. Also, she did buy me lunch and dinner last time before she went off on me, which is nice and I definitely appreciate it, so maybe I should do what she says for a little bit.

My bf (30) and I (28) live together in a 2-bedroom apartment -- one room for us to sleep, and my home office (I work from home). We have a dog together.

Some background -- I work in my chosen career because I discovered in college that I have a natural talent/knack for it. I could complete assignments in a fraction of the time it took my peers while still getting top grades. I don't love it, and I don't find it that fulfilling, but I realized the talent was a ""gift"" to be grateful for, and I wasn't anywhere near as 'talented' in the stuff I did love or find fulfilling.

Because I'm quick, I've volunteered to take on more than my ""equal"" share of work -- I'm on a team of 5 people with my role, and I take on about 1/3 of our team's workload, and the other 4 split the remaining 2/3 (they know this, and check frequently that I'm okay with the split, and I reassure them I'm fine). Despite this, I still only work around 25 hours a week.

My boyfriend works an actual 40 hours a week plus commute. I make more money than he does and I pay 75% of our rent. We try to split chores evenly. I cook dinner a few nights a week and do laundry, he takes care of trash/recycling, and we split dishes. I take care of feeding our dog and letting him out in the morning. I hire a service to do deeper cleaning.

This is where I might be TA, and we're having a disagreement. My bf feels that because I basically have an extra \~17 hours to spare that when unexpected extra chores pop up it should be on my plate, and generally I agree and do so. However, last week our dog needed to have his fecal sample taken to the vet. His vet is a 5-10min drive past my bf's workplace, but a 30-35min drive from home, so it seemed so inefficient for me to do it. I asked my bf if he could drop the sample off since it would be a 10-20min chore for him, but a 60-70min chore for me. He did it, but felt it wasn't fair to him.

I'm assuming my mom forgot my son's birthday. I don't think she actually knows either of the kids birthdays, but if someone reminds her she will give them money. So she stopped by to get the clubs and I told her we were entertaining and tried to hurry her out. 

My wife called my mom's name from upstairs, so my mom went up and I knew it wasn't going to be pretty.

I saw my wife and MIL smirking at each other, and my wife asked my son to give my mom three guesses about why they were having cake.

My issue at the moment is his brother (31 M) is staying with us in his grandmother's old 2 story home. They both pay rent but I have no knowledge of the bills on who pays what. I'm a SAHM who cooks, cleans, and takes care of our son for the sake of not paying daycare of 1,500+ a week since he is the only one working in sales. However after he complains about money I see alcohol (big bottles) being bought and he says he splits it with his brother to deal with stress of being a single provider. His work goes 1 week early morning and the next week late to night work so me trying to find a full time.job to help out is basically no where to be seen so I do side jobs for extra money to buy diapers or hold off for a rainy day. But today pushed me over the edge, I came back from driving with our son from his grandparents house (3 hours away) I told him since I would return at midnight that if he can watch our son in the morning so I can get an extra hr of sleep. Mind you I rarely do this since he only gets 1 day off per week I let him game n sleep extra hours while I take my job of being a SAHM seriously. He said ""sure"" I wake up to find my son running to me after he was ""throwing a tantrum"" when in reality he needed a diaper change because his poop was dried to him. My husband said ""I changed him before"" but didn't bother to check again even after countless times of me telling him if our son is fussy that he needs to check the steps of: feed, change, sleep. He wasn't even looking after him just laying down an had the TV on for idk how long. After changing him I told my husband in front of his brother and his brother laughed and when I told him about it his brother stepped in to say my husband has been working 8hrs shifts back to back n that I shouldn't be mad but glad cuz it's his money that is allowing me to stay home. I didn't want to fight so I left because I'm tired of the whole ""I work"" talks so I told my husband if I wanted an opinion that it be his and not his brother telling me I should.be grateful.for the bare minimum. He just thinks im.trying to start another fight so I gave him the ultimatum either his brother moves out or I do with our son.

Background info: my parents have not been together for 25 years, they had a messy divorce, my father has alcohol problems and has been in and out of my life ever since. Nonetheless, my mother and father for some reason bought musical tickets in my city this weekend and were planning for my bf and I to go together with them and some other relatives. My father really wanted to meet my bf for the first time. Unfortunately I got covid this week and was unable to go. Since my father really wanted to meet my bf I encouraged him to go with them. My bf really didn't want to go, so my sister offered to ""chaperone"" them (my sister is NC with our father). 

My bf and I have been fighting about this, my bf really didn't want to go, bc he felt it would be a v awkward way of meeting my father for the first time. My family thought it would be wasteful to not use the tickets, since they were already payed for, and expected him to go even though I couldn't make it. My bf finally accepted but is now really mad at me, but I feel like I am worse off than him not being able to go the musical I really wanted to see.
