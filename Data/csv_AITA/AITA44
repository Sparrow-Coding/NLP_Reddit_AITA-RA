I grew up within her Pentecostal community. I have since grown up and got married. My husband has tattoos, as do I. When my mom found out about mine, she was very disappointed that I didn’t tell her. She said, “I feel like I don’t even know you”. That broke my heart. I swore that moving forward I would tell her about everything that might scare her about myself because it’s better that she knows the truth from me than learning from somebody else. 

For further context: my dad used to be an alcoholic before I was born. He was abusive but he did sober up and tried making it up to us by being a present husband and father. My father was diagnosed with dementia 13 years ago and passed away last year. Mom was very upset over his death and she was in denial that he was even dying. She also believes that God will punish everyone for their transgressions. She constantly said God was punishing Dad for being a terrible person 40 years ago. 

Anyway, my husband and I moved into an apartment in March. We invited mom over to check it out but we have since stocked a whole bar. My husband loves making cocktails and hosting friends so he likes to keep everyone’s favorite in stock. I knew mom would be upset but I figured the night my husband is out of town is the perfect night to break the ice. 

Mom was heartbroken when she saw it. She refused to eat dinner and constantly referred to my husband and I as alcoholics. There is a difference between a person who has one drink occasionally and a person who gets drunk every night. My mom was excited to come over, and she even dressed up which is rare for her. She called my other sister and asked, “how should I deal with people like this”, as if I’m some kind of stranger. 

Part of me feels bad. I wasn’t trying to start drama, even though I knew she would react poorly. I just wanted her to be aware that this is us and if you’re going to come over, you’re going to have to be ok with it. 

One of my sisters understands as she is in the same boat. Mom constantly lectures her about her lifestyle choices. My other sister said that it would make her feel uncomfortable to have a bottle in front of her face as she’s eating dinner. But should be people really have to hide their things to make guests feel comfortable?

I told him it's none of his business and he should leave me alone. He ignored it and kept asking me questions.

He looked super sick after that and ran to the restroom. My coworker went to check on him and said he's been throwing up and I'd need to clean up.

Country B is well known for a strong family bonds and l knew that before I got myself into this. 
I pay 75% of the rent, she pays the rest. Utilities goes 50/50.
It all started with Corona. Her brother came to country C for seasonal jobs. Then pandemic hit and he was trapped here. So he stayed in our (1ldk, literally no space to turn around) apartment since it's an emergency. In return, he was cleaning and doing dishes. I didn't ask money for rent, nor for increased utilities. And I was ok with the situation. He's not a bad bloke, and he cooks better than his sister. 
Once Rona calmed down and he managed to get seasonal jobs he's been going and coming back periodically. Each time staying here for a week or two before his next job starts. 

At this point no one even asks me if he can stay, it's just announced that he will be coming back on ""Tuesday"" 
The problem is that he's leaving his big luggage here and using our already tiny apartment as a storage place. 
Since he was able to get the jobs he's been giving me some money for rent and stuff (like a 100$ for 2 weeks of stay or so) which as I mentioned he's not a bad person. However he relies on his sister way too much, he's 25, doesn't have his own bank/Amazon account. Just recently he got a phone number and he's using his sister's back account to pay for it. Whenever he needs something from Amazon/buying plane/train tickets/doing paperwork for documents, he's always asking her. And then she complains to me about how much he asks her help, while doing everything he is asking. 
I honestly think it would be more beneficial for him if she stopped granting his every wish. 

So once I asked her for how long will this continue (by this, I mean he coming back here every time) she got visibly upset, and started saying that he's family and he should be allowed to stay for as long as he needs to. 
And then we started arguing. 
I wasn't able to properly explain why I was not happy with the situation, and now she thinks I'm cruel and mean for not wanting to help her family.

I have supported her the entire time by always telling her I’m here to support her and sending her money to pay her bills. My friend is dating/ lives with her coworker (29m) and works at the same place as my sister (25f).

This year, my sister threw a Halloween party for her coworkers at her house (I was not there). Everyone was pretty intoxicated, but from what I gathered my friend’s bf was being very rude to my friend and my sister stuck for her. He was also flirting with another girl there in front of my friend. A huge argument started between my sister and the bf that carried on outside. He said some very disrespectful things to my sister that night. My friend says she wasn’t around when they were arguing. Still not sure on where she even was. Anyways, my friend and her bf left together that night. 

I tried to reach out to my friend for 3 weeks to get her side and she gave me the complete run around. She would just blatantly ignored my texts or kept telling me she “would call me tomorrow”. Finally I texted her telling her I cannot support her relationship based on the way he treated my sister and treats her. I also said I was worried about her safety and mental well-being. I told her I will always be here to support her and help her if she wants to leave. 

She eventually called me. Told me she is mentally exhausted and having a hard time even taking care of herself. She told me she can’t get any time alone from the bf. Also told me he has been cheating on her. She said she is saving up money to get an apartment and leave him. 

I of course offered to help her, we figured out a plan, and we were going to see an apartment together. I flew home for thanksgiving last week and saw her on Wednesday to celebrate my birthday. After that, I didn’t hear from her again. She blew off all my calls &amp; texts and didn’t see the apartment. This was not about the Halloween party, I just wanted to see her before I left the state again. 

I texted her one last time and told her not contact me if she is going to disrespect me as a friend. Also I told her I shouldn’t have to try this hard to be her friend and I’m not going to. 

I’ve got mixed responses to this situation. Some think I should continue supporting her because of the MH issues and the “without me, then who?” mentality.

For the first year she seemed great, and we hung out quite a lot. However after a year maybe she got ‘comfortable’ and started being very indirectly rude to me and my partner. It started small so we didn’t really address it but it has been getting worse. 

She is about 6 years older than us, and is generally a very opinionated person and will be very quick to correct you if she thinks you are wrong. 

She has openly said she hates most men (except her partner obviously) as she has had some trauma in the past with an ex partner. She has other trauma relating to her upbringing which we spoke about when we were close. I feel like she has a lot of anger at the world and is misdirecting it/ not managing her emotions well. I often avoid hanging around her as much as possible and have started ignoring her messages.

She can be rude to me, by making snappy comments, or not making any conversation at all which creates an awkward atmosphere, but my main concern is how she treats my partner.

She had an argument with him whilst staying at our house and was openly saying his opinion was stupid (I actually agreed with him). The next day when we were alone, she brought it up and kept trying to affirm that he was wrong and she was right. I calmly explained that I actually thought he was right and gave reasons why. 

She couldn’t let it go and it got super awkward. This is after staying in our house for several days so she could go to work (she works remotely otherwise) and us cooking her dinner and driving her around.

We have been avoiding her since but had a bbq yesterday with our friends - we invited her as we wanted her partner to come and couldn’t just invite him. 

She didn’t make an effort to speak to anyone, napped for serval hours, didn’t eat any food and went out to get her own takeout, and then left without saying goodbye with her partner running after her.

She barely speaks to my partner or looks at
Him since their argument, and I’ve been told she talks shit about him to our other friends.

I want to send her a message to say how I think her behaviour is rude and unreasonable and she makes things awkward in the group. However, I worry that because of her past trauma this will cause her to be depressed and / or it will make our friend group dynamics even werider when she is around. I just think her blatant disrespect for people is horrific and it’s time I tell her. AITA for wanting to put her in her place / make her aware of her behaviour? I can’t tell if it will be constructive or just give me brief satisfaction of telling her what I think. 

Side notes - she says she has ADHD which I think she uses as a guise to be rude to people. And also blames her trauma a lot of things. She never apologies or really acknowledges it - but blames her behaviour on this indirectly.  She’s 35 and I think she needs to be responsible for her actions.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4851846,public,top,self,AITA for wanting to confront a rude ‘friend’,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbynpb/aita_for_wanting_to_confront_a_rude_friend/,all_ads,6,,,,,

He has a little sister E(21F) and I always seen her as my little sister too. It’s been a couple of weeks that she’s been avoiding me, my husband was as confused as me, he tried to talk with her but she said that he wouldn’t understand. 
L is mad with me because he thinks I’ve done something to her, being her big brother he can be really protective. 

I’ve decided to go to her apartment and talk with her, I pressed record the moment I knocked at her door. She confessed that she despises me because I stole her brother to his childhood best friend (R 29F), and that she always imagined him ended up with her. She said that she thought she liked me because I was kind but know she realizes that I am not meant to be with him but R is. That he is only with me because I remind him of her and I stole R’s place (she didn’t pass the first year of med school but my husband and I did) in his life and hers (she was her first big sister figure). 
R and us have lost contact since 2years now but R had made contact with E recently, that R have been in love with L since there childhood and seeing him with me was hurting her (being my maid of honor was the worst day of her life) so that’s why she cut all contact with us (she said to us that she was beginning a new chapter in her life where we wouldn’t be in it. It destroyed us for months to the point we questioned ourselves). 

I was shocked, I didn’t know what to think and I had no idea of the situation (she dated people and had a long relationship with one of them) and even before I dated L, I asked her if she had feelings for him. She denied so many times. 

And now R is planning to come back to our town, apologize to my husband for leaving him and she will confess to him, E will have her back : R was her first big sister and I took this from her too, she believes L will end things me. She said : “you still didn’t gave him a child, so a divorce won’t be too complicated”.

It killed me.

We don’t even sleep in the same bed, since she cried calling L (it’s been 4days), because I still didn’t “made things right” with E. 
And I assure you, I would forgave E if she apologizes but I hope it will be before R does what she’s planning to. And I would forgave R too, I understand the place she was if only she was coming for other reasons, I really missed her. 

Only my brother (V 28M) knows about the recording and he was this close to knock some senses into my husband, I dissuaded him of course, he noticed it too that E was different with me. He is really disappointed with the both of them and assured me if things go bad (I hope not), my family will always be by my side.

3 months turned in to 8. She’s been having trouble keeping a stable job - first job she quit out of the blue because she hated her boss, second she was fired.

I want to help her get on her feet, but I can’t help feel like I’m stunting her and/or she is using me. She spends her money like someone with a significant amount disposable income - eating out every meal, nails, shopping trips, hair, etc. I am very aware that she wouldn’t be able to afford this lifestyle if she was paying rent - 200/month is not enough to make someone feel responsible for their finances. She doesn’t help around the house unless asked, and when she’s not eating out, seems to assume meals are “family” meals aka me or my husband are cooking for her.

I (32F) went to a comedy show with my husband (34M). It was in a relatively small venue. Folding chairs without armrests were set up in rows. 

When we arrived we showed one of the ushers our tickets and she directed us to our seats. When we got there, I noticed that next to us was an extremely overweight person who was taking up at least a quarter, if not closer to half, of the chair next to him. There was no way either of us would fit on the chair next to him—we are not overweight but not necessarily stick thin either. We would’ve spilled over into the next chair and then both of us would be squished. 

I asked if there were any other seats we could have. The usher asked what was wrong and I said “I just don’t think we are all going to fit in this row”. The usher looked a little taken aback and the overweight man didn’t say anything but we were close enough that he must’ve heard. 

They ended up moving us up a few rows up where there were two empty seats. It wasn’t exactly an “upgrade” as the view wasn’t much better. As soon as we sat down my husband told me I embarrassed him and the man who probably knows he is overweight and doesn’t fit in the seats. I am sympathetic and my goal was not to shame the other guy, but I paid for a full seat and I was expecting a full seat, not half of a seat that was squished up against another stranger.

I’ve never met her in person, but she texts a fair amount and seemed like a lively personality, so I was happy to get to know her a bit better. My very close friend Sachi also joined us, but I was prepared for a bigger group than just the three of us.

The problem started after we got seated at the restaurant and started to order. I had a sizable budget since I was prepared for more people. So money was not exactly at the front of my mind, I knew how much Sachi and I ate and that we couldn’t possible go over with one extra person. I get myself an appetizer and a main course. Fifty five dollars. Sachi orders herself a main course, and asks to steal some of my appetizer. Fine, another thirty. Then comes Nicole. She picks out the most expensive possible appetizers, main course, and desserts, proceeds to add every single paid modification possible, alongside a couple of drinks. Half way through the order I tell her to relax and that we could get more later, but she insisted that she wanted everything. I then told her that if she kept going I wouldn’t pay for it, but she literally laughed at me and told me I said I’d pay, so she was going to order what she liked. Her personal total came up above a hundred and fifty dollars. 

To me, this was in bad faith and I wasn’t having it. She was taking advantage of the fact that I was treating her, and using it to eat and stock her fridge for a few days with the leftovers. Obviously, when it came time for the bill, Nicole did not take well to the fact that I covered Sachi and not her. She told me that she wasn’t leaving until I paid her bill. I was not willing to compromise because it seemed clear to me that I was being abused. We waited for over an hour as she threw a fit and attempted to guilt me into paying.

Eventually her boyfriend texted me looking for her, so I explained the situation. He got pissed and told me to just pay and take her home, but I was adamant, so I gave him the address of the restaurant, made sure he was coming, and left her there. She is now telling everyone that I’m a liar and abandoned her in the middle of nowhere last night.

She was extremely abusive both physically and mentally towards me and my parents never got her help or intervened. I mainly took care of myself growing up which I didn’t mind then but as an adult realized how it negative effects my ability to form relationships. 

A year ago, my sister found herself pregnant by a guy she had only been seeing for a short time. She wanted to keep the baby and my mom and I were supportive and my dad came around but it took him awhile. I tried to put the past behind me and We did get closer while she was pregnant at first because she seemed appreciative of our support but that didn’t last. She went back to her selfish ways but used the pregnancy as an excuse to behave how she wanted. At the time because The economy sucks and housing is expensive , we both still lived at home. I worked over 60 a week and would come home after 10+ hr days and she’d have not cleaned or done anything around the house before or after her waitressing shift. We switched rooms because mine was bigger and she’d needed more space for the baby. Did construction on the house (approx $7000 to redo the closets, floors, heat system, patch and paint etc), so they would have a nice place to live.  She had a very easy pregnancy but very difficult labor. They are both ok and I love my niece with all of my heart. 
Her baby daddy had family issues and he had to go out of town the day they came home from the hospital. My mom and I helped her all day and night and have been every since. He made little snipes when he came back that I didn’t appreciate but I kept it to myself. bf seems otherwise to be a good guy but makes very little effort to get to know us and be apart of the family.
I decided to take the financial hit and move out, even tho I am paying out of pocket for grad school so the baby could have her own room. My sisters bf also moved in with my parents, intended as temporary, after a huge fight with his family. Most days my mom is helping my sister with the baby because he works a lot. They rarely say thank you or show appreciation. 
Her bf found a place to rent as he always intended. We expected my sister to move out eventually, if their relationship continued but not right away because of how little he was home and how much helped my sister needed. Well my sister decided to move in with him now. She admitted that her bf wanted them to move in because if they lived separately he’d never get to see the baby because of his schedule. Like I said works a ton and often doesn’t get home until after the baby is asleep with my sister and my mom taking care of the baby a majority of the time. We’ve all made significant financial and physical sacrifices for my sister and niece. I’m happy he’s stuck around and is trying to provide for them. Still, it’s hard because after all the changes we made,

My sister “Sarah” has always felt a bit envious of me even though I strongly try to support her. She is a bit on the shorter side so I think she is somewhat self conscious about that.

I worked extremely hard (working everyday, 10 hours+ a day) building my business and I always try to show her my love by doing favors for her and her friends and trying my best to support her. I even bought into a franchise with a partner giving her more ownership into it with no risk as she put in nothing. The buy-in itself was around $100,000 with the intent of her quitting her job to work there as a manager. She could potentially manage the franchise. However, she failed to quit her job even though her job paid minimum wage. She has always been very afraid of doing things like quitting her job for a better career opportunity. 

Because she refused to help out the business and refused to take responsibility, I was working even more crazy hours waking up at 6 and getting home very late everyday. I eventually had to sell as I really couldn’t handle much of this anymore. I sold at a huge loss which really set me back from buying a home and it really hurt as she felt like she did not do anything wrong.

One of the bigger issues is that she has an inferiority complex and always tries to berate others which doesn’t allow her to have many friends. I try to give her advice on what she might be doing wrong so she can live a happy life. It eventually turns to yelling as she never listens but I only want her to do better. 

I have occasionally asked her for money when I was broke but never as much as I spent on the business or the things I buy her. While I was renovating a condo I bought, my friend asks her how she feels about me and she said something along the lines of “she has me paying for her car insurance and car payments (I’ve leased 2 cars and she has paid for both of them)” Once paid in full, my intent was to buy her a new car. Honestly, it hurt where I thought to end my relationship with her but I forgave her.

I have also offered to put a down payment down for her for a co-op but she can't pay monthly payments. While she received $30,000 from grandpa, she decided to spend it on her wedding which I personally did not think it was a wise expenditure but I never said anything as I think it will make her happy. 

I just do not feel like she has not been happy for me. She said my job was “lying people out of their money” because I have a side hustle that may require me to do my main job and side hustle but I always make up the work for my main job which I resent because I work really really hard at both of these jobs often sleeping for 4 hours a night.

She does sometimes say that I live a good life because she has paid for the 2 cars that I’ve had which is hurtful because I always try to pay her back tenfold.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4851797,public,top,self,AITA for not loving my sister anymore?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbybhh/aita_for_not_loving_my_sister_anymore/,all_ads,6,,,,,

He has been nothing but supportive and nice and we rarely get in fights (the only “fight” was a mistake I had made and we thankfully resolved it). My boyfriend got me wonderful, thoughtful, and useful birthday gifts this year (his bday hasn’t passed yet). My boyfriend and I have agreed that we won’t do Christmas present as we both think that pressure of needing to get a gift often causes meaningless gifts and we both just buy what we want, when we want it. 

I have very fond memories of doing an advent calendar every year for Christmas with my family (and general love of the Christmas season). This is my first year truly spending the holiday alone (not living at my parents house or with a roommate) so I don’t have anyone to do an advent calendar with. I figured I would do it for my boyfriend since he regularly stays the night and will be able to open it in the morning. My boyfriend told me before I started that I “don’t have to do that” for him and I told him that I know, but I want to. 

The first day he didn’t take the gift and it hurt my feelings. When I texted him that he “forgot his advent gift” he said he wanted to wait for me (fair, if he felt that he should open it with me). He came over his lunch break and opened it - we had fun with it! (It was a scratch-off and a note about one thing I like about him). Second day he opened it when he came over and it was a quick but fun time. 

This morning (day 3) when I reminded him of his advent (he woke up at my place) he said “Stop doing this for me”

I know he didn’t mean it maliciously but it really hurt my feelings. I’ve told him how I feel about the calendar (see paragraph 2) and I was taken aback by his statement. I just wanted to continue the tradition.

However it was our own fault, as we clearly didn’t look into this enough before saying yes.

It’s more or less become my job to be the mother 2.0. Which is fine I guess, I’m doing college online so it’s not like I wouldn’t be home to do stuff anyway.
One of my unofficial “jobs” is to help my dad grocery shop. I used to go with him to do it, and I would make the list myself and just grab what we needed, but now that I drive the boys around for their extracurriculars and I’m busy with school or chores when I’m not helping them, I don’t really have the time.
I just started writing the list and giving it to my dad so he could go out and get what we needed.

Every single time this man has gone to the grocery store by himself he has either completely forgotten about the list, remembered the list then lost it, remembered the list but ignored it, or somehow could not find more than half of the things on it.
It’s hard to cook an actual dinner when literally half of what he ends up bringing home is frozen meals and pasta sauce (but no pasta).

I’ve brought it up to him, but dad keeps saying that if I would just make time to go with him or if I went on my own, it would probably be easier to get what we needed. I said that we could switch jobs, so he takes the boys to their things and I get groceries, but he said he doesn’t know their schedules and he wouldn’t want to mess it up for them.

He said he’d go grocery shopping today, and asked me to go with him, but I was working on some stuff for my finals before I had to drive the 10yo and 8yo to their practices so I couldn’t go.
I started making the list like I usually do, but because I didn’t want to end up with only half of what I’d put on there, I went and printed the layout of the grocery store. I even went online and found which aisle each product was supposed to be in and I color coded the stuff he needed to get. I left it for him on the table and then went to take the boys.

While I was doing school work during their practice, my dad called me asking why I felt the need to color code a map for him like he was a toddler in need of specific instruction. I replied saying that I only thought the map might make it easier for him to find the things I put on the list, since I also made sure that everything was in stock online.

It’s been hours since we’ve gotten back home and he’s very clearly upset with me, but he did get the stuff on the list this time.

I've started to learn more asl so that I could hold a basic conversation with someone who knows it, and thought I'd teach my friend as well so she could translate for me. I noticed her becoming progressively more aggressive with me when I'd try to sign to her, but thought nothing of it. Eventually she lashed out about how she doesn't know ASL and that I should stop trying to talk to her with it. I explained that I was confused because I thought I was doing alright at teaching her it, and that we could try other ways for her to learn. She just got angrier and said she wasn't going to learn it so I'd just have to learn to speak for myself. I told her she was being an ass for not trying to accommodate for my disability, and that she basically signed up for this when deciding to be friends with me.

I haven't tried to sign with her again, and have instead moved to just writing things down when I go mute.

We were besties throughout our twenties and she was there for me through so much and vice versa.

6 years ago she flew out to my wedding in Hawaii and was a bridesmaid. We considered each other ""life buddies."" As we neared our 30's we drifted apart. I moved to a different state with my husband and have since had two kids. Despite the change, I still considered her to be a close friend even though we rarely spoke. 

Tiffany texted me out of the blue this fall to say she's getting married. The catch is she was getting married in 6 weeks and she needed an RSVP in 3 weeks. She asked for my email to send an Evite. I started looking into flights &amp; lodging (expensive but doable) The primary issue was childcare. My kids are 2 and 4 years old and literally no one lives by us. It was too short of notice to fly my mom out and the wedding was on a Friday. My husband started a new job and had no PTO in the bank. So, the only option would be flying and attending alone with 2 kids. 

Tif then left me a voicemail saying that kids weren't *technically* allowed at the wedding but she would make an exception for me. It was a nice gesture but honestly made me feel awkward.

The upshot is I wound up declining. I called her twice leading up to the big day leaving heartfelt messages (no answer... She must be busy), sent her a generous gift, texted her (no answer), texted again (no response). We weren't as close but always responded to each other immediately.

We have both been a range of different weights throughout our relationship and it’s fair to say we both have pretty major food issues. Since Covid I have been stuck working from home full time whereas my fiancé has an active job with long hours. Since I am so sedentary and at home all day adjacent to the kitchen, I have found it incredibly difficult to keep from gaining weight. For the first year or so I tried to diet but I kept failing and ended up binge-eating more weeks than not. It was making me feel really miserable, so I eventually decided to stop dieting and try to just focus on my body image and mental health and healing my damaged relationship with food. To be honest, I question whether it’s the right thing to do, but I do feel generally more at peace and at least I’m not wasting energy and money on diets that clearly don’t work for me in the long run. Anyway, my problem is that when my fiancé talks to me about his own weight issues, I find it very triggering. At first, when I was struggling with trying to diet, he was doing really well, and would weigh himself in front of me every day and tell me about every single weight fluctuation. When I tried to tell him that it triggered my anxieties about my own weight he sulked and said that he didn’t have anyone else to talk to about his achievement. Now, a year or so later we are both not currently dieting and have both put on weight, and every time he gets dressed in the morning he comments about how he feels in his clothes, whether things are tight/loose, mentions that he needs to lose weight, and asks for reassurance about how he looks. Then every evening he talks about how he has really enjoyed his food today but wants to eat healthier starting tomorrow and again comments on his body. Then sometimes just before bed the subject will come up again. I understand what he is going through and want to be sympathetic, but I feel like having these conversations multiple times a day is really disturbing my peace. I just want to be able to get through a day or even a meal without weight being mentioned. I feel unkind saying that, because I want to be a supportive partner, but at the same time I feel I have the right to set boundaries for my own mental health, because this is an incredibly raw and painful subject for me as well.

I guess when my father 22M at the time was in the military, had an affair on his ex-wife with his military friends sister 17F who got pregnant . She was not allowed to see my father since her parents didn't allow it. So my father never saw her again but ig knew about her cuz his friend showed him a baby picture of her. His ex-wife also pregnant at the time. My father went on with his life had his two sons with his ex-wife, met my mother, had me. My father took that secret too the grave.

Another aunt went on ancestry DNA 4 years ago, created a family tree. So did my sister 4 years ago. She is now 38F. So my aunt2 contacted her and found out she was my father's daughter she knew her father's name. She talked to my aunt's,my brothers, and some cousins. This all happened 3 years ago. My eldest brother cut contact with her. He also 38M, she's 6 months older than him.

BUT HERE IS WHY I'M LIVID. MY Aunt had told me she THOUGHT MY BROTHERS TOLD ME ESPECIALLY THE BROTHER THAT TALKS TO HER he is 28M. NO ONE TOLD ME FOR THREE YEARS. We aren't close but I've seen them enough for them them to tell me . HE KNOWN FOR THREE YEARS and EVEN MET HER 3 years ago with his daughter, gf, our aunt's and grandmother nobody told me. THEY EVEN went to our father's grave without me. I would have at least liked to know she existed. My brother also didn't tell her nothing about me some of my aunts told her about me. I'm really hurt and angry because nobody told me and they known for 3 years and lots of family have met her. I feel like an idiot not important at all. My mother says I'm overreacting being angry at them.My friends agree with me that I should be angry.My mother's friend also agrees I should have known. MY grandmother my moms mother asked me why do I care. I CARE Because this is something I think should HAVE KNOWN. I have been crying since I found out and angry I don't think I ever want to see my brothers again especially the 28M brother I think it was their responsibility to tell me not my aunts. I don't have NOTHING AGAINST MY NEW SISTER. IM JUST ANGRY AT PEOPLE WHO KNEW AND DIDN'T THINK TO TELL ME! I DON'T EVEN THINK I WOULD HAVE EVER KNOWN IF MY AUNT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

SO AITA for being angry and hurt about this and not knowing while everyone else did for 3 years? How would you react if this happened to you?

I will try to make this short. My family has two dogs. One is so sweet, and one is like the second coming of Satan. My parents are thinking of getting another dog. The one they are thinking of is actually really cute, and if we didn't have the one dog that is so misbehaved, I wouldn't even hesitate on getting it. 

Our one dog barks an insane amount, he's is bad around people. He snaps so much, he has bitten me multiple times throughout the years. Long story short, he makes me miserable a lot of times. Which is so dumb because he's just a dog lol. I have wanted to get rid of him for years, but my parents refuse. We've had huge arguments about this. We had my cousins over one day a few months ago, and he barked for 5 hours straight. I swear, I wish I was kidding. I have had multiple headaches over the summer because of him. No one even wants to come over anymore. We usually have all holidays at our house, but this year one of my family members decided we cant do that anymore because of the barking. So no holidays are at our house this year, thank God. However, the dog actually isn't bad with other dogs, so I dont have to worry about him going after the new one or anything.

Our other dog is so sweet like I said, and she really doesn't bother anyone, and she loves to play. And when we bring her around other dogs, she gets along so well with them. And I would love for her to have another dog to play with every day, because our other dog doesn't play with her.

My parents have not thought twice about getting this new dog. If we have two dogs that bark nonstop, I dont know what I am going to do. Obviously we have to train this new dog, and it may end up being extremely well behaved like our other one, no one can tell the future. But everyone seems to be ignoring the fact that three dogs is a ton of work, and we already have a terrible dog. I was arguing with my mom earlier about this, and told her I am the only one in this house that thinks with their brain. She disregarded everything I had to say and called me crazy and dramatic. I love my parents, and I think its wonderful that they enjoy our dogs so much that they want another, but I feel like Im totally being ignored. Theyre acting like I dont live here, and that what I have to say doesn't matter. Which is weird because in the beginning my mom said I would be the deciding factor on if we got this dog or not. My mom hasn't spoken to me since earlier, Im assuming cause of what I said

Me and my mom flew down to visit her and host a baby shower for her, during which there was a game where people tried to make the weirdest baby name. It wasn't meant to be a hurtful activity, so no real names, more of a ""haha wouldn't it be funny to name your kid Imperator Nero Cladius Divi Claudius filius Caesar Augustus Germanicus?"" 

It was all going well until my aunt made an offhand comment about my own name being weird. After reading all of the names she laughed and said ""well, if I want a weird name I can just do what OP's mother did!"" in front of all the guests. Me and my mom kinda paused and asked her what the hell she meant by that. My aunt responded that while my name is certainly unique, she wouldn't want to name her baby something so 'difficult and weird' 

Now to give her some undeserved credit, my name is long. I'm biracial (as will her kid be) and my parents decided to give me very ethnic names from both countries along with a hyphenated last name. Is it annoying sometimes? Yes, but me and many people who have met me think that my name, while long, is very pretty. 

Things wrapped up pretty soon after that with my mom taking me aside and explaining that while it was a bitchy thing to say, we cannot yell at her because god knows we don't need more family drama. Fine, I won't yell, but there was no way I was letting that slide. So for the rest of our stay I decided to help my aunt out and make sure her baby's name wasn't 'weird and complicated' by suggesting some common names that everyone knows!

For example: Clorox, Speculum, Cyanide, Marijuana, Windows 11, Boaty McBoatface, McDonalds

Apparently yelling wasn't the only way I could've made family drama because lord did it come down. Her husband even made some of his own choice names for me! However after getting home yesterday I began realizing that it might've not been the nicest thing to do to a pregnant woman over a small comment that I could've easily brushed over.

Our fourth, who was born 3 years ago, was supposed to be our last. With that particular child, she OK’d a family name that I was particularly set on, but when the baby was a different gender, we went down a different path of her choosing, skipping the feminine form of the name.

Fast forward to a few days ago when we welcomed the birth of a boy. During the pregnancy, I was consistently adamant about this name if it was a boy, whereas she was adamant that she didn’t want it.Although I occasionally suggested an alternative name for posterity, I continued to express that the family name was my first choice. Meanwhile, her suggestions vacillated, ultimately settling on choosing a name “because the boy looked like a (name)”. 

Some of the reasons that I heard for not picking the name was that “we honored (my) family’s names enough” (2 of my daughters have my mother’s maiden name, where another child has her father’s name), she didn’t like the name, and one relating to her general disdain of my father (who I will add, has not done himself any favors to rectify that). Another , that the family name would’ve been used for baby #4 so it couldn’t be an option for baby #5, is by my opinion, so devoid of logic that it’s almost a deal breaker in itself.

Ultimately when it came time to bring the baby home I caved and told her to name the baby her choice, taking a secondary different family name for the middle name as consolation. Prior to such, she mentioned she didn’t want me to resent this, but I feel with the speed of which this happened and lack of acknowledgement of what I view as a sacrifice, that isn’t really a concern of hers.

I feel like I went so far and stood my ground to the very end, when I blinked, and something that I was looking forward to honoring was lost so that I could appease her. I am now in deep regret of not seeing this through, looking at this as a microcosm of our marriage where I feel at times that the score is always kept for my side but never on hers. I can’t even bear to say the child’s given name, and harbor deep resentment over this issue to the point where I question how I could have devoted so much of my life to someone who would want to deny me this privilege only for posterity it seems (like, we can’t have you be too happy type of feelings)

I have myself to blame, of course, but I’m angry when I should be feeling blessed. And I’m sure I will be passive aggressive about it and stew in my own juices, which does no one any good.

We've lived together like this for 4 months. (Previously bf and I were renting alone and it was bliss, but rent sucks in Toronto).

The house has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen/living room, and a laundry room/pantry. My bf and I keep our room and bathroom very clean. SIL and her daughter do not put much care into their rooms, and sometimes the food that they leave around their room, attracts pests that affect the whole household.

As of right now, the shared household chores (i.e. cleaning common areas, dishes, shovelling snow) are split 1/3 between the three adults in the house. However, this has been quite difficult for my bf and I for the following reasons.

Bf works 40 hrs/ week in construction (electrical). He leaves home early and comes home tired and dirty. Much of his time after work is spent cleaning up, eating, and then winding down for bed. I work from home about 50-60 hrs /week in finance. Weekends are typically not off for me. Even though I am home and I sit next door to the washer/dryer, or kitchen, I have literally no time to do any chores during my work hours. Since bf and I work, we pay the utility bills, some of the grocery bills, and any other unexpected expenses.

SIL doesn't work, although she has her personal support worker certification, and PSWs are highly in demand in Toronto, for a high salary. Her baby daddy is a loser who is an absent father, other than major days like birthdays and Christmas. SIL feels some connection to him and doesn't want to fight him for child support. Therefore, she has no income, contributes nothing financially, and uses a small sum from in-laws to buy useless things for her and her daughter. 

Even though SIL is a single mother, my in-laws are home with us every day from 3pm-10pm to hangout with niece after school, and they're here pretty much all weekend. SIL does nothing all day except look at her phone/laptop, and her daughter comes home from school to play Roblox, or watch Tiktoks until bedtime.

Bf and I find most of our time outside work, being put towards our personal chores like laundry and cleaning our own room. We also feel like a lot of the messes that we are cleaning up (dishes, hair etc) are from SIL and her daughter's culinary experiments, and trying hairstyles in the common areas.

I decided to take the kiddo that I was babysitting to my library, where they were having a holiday event. It was cute.

Since I work there part-time, I was helping out a bit, especially since we were WAY understaffed. Now, we're in a very small town, and everyone knows everyone. It's not rare for someone to look after someone else's kid for a minute, within reason. I was with another staff member, that's it, and she was working the hot cocoa stand.

Then, some grandmother who we've never seen before (she's not in the community, which is fine) comes in with her three-or-so-year-old grandson. She sets him down, tells him to ""ask the ladies"" if he needs anything, and lets him go. 

I was, of course, focusing on the kiddo that I was working with. She is old enough to look after herself for a moment or two, but I still wanna be with her, cuz, ya know. I was crafting with her, and helping some other kiddos, but then this toddler terror starts throwing a tantrum. 

This was about 20 minutes of pure chaos. Neither my coworker or I wanted to grab him- we have a strict no touch policy unless we have permission of the guardian- but it was crazy. The kid took our coloring sheets and ripped them, waved the bowl of mini marshmallows across the floor, screamed his lungs out, ripped the tablecloth off, and started using our dotter to mark the wall, and then he hit my final button. He took off his shoes, and threw them at some unsuspecting mom. 

At this point, I straight up take my kiddo's hand, walk into the across the hall where the grandma was quietly having some coffee and chatting, and told her that she needed to be there with her grandson. Every other kid had a guardian today, and we didn't know them- and he was really ruining everyone else's nice holiday fun.

Then, despite me having a kid with me, she curses me out and tells me that I am the worker, and therefore my responsibility (reminder that I wasn't on shift, but I was still helping, and yes, my kiddo's mom knew that too). She threatened to get me fired. I basically told her then that either she went with him, or left- I know that my supervisor wouldn't fire me over that.

So my two friends and I are travelling to another city next week to see a concert and we decided to go by train. One friend (B) had booked the hotel we’re staying at in full, while my other friend (C) and I promised we would pay him back. Since then, C and I have paid B back for the hotel and everyone is happy.

This is where it go’s downhill. 

B, C, and I were all talking about how we’re going to get to the other city. Driving was a too much of a hassle so we all agreed on a train. I asked C if he wouldn’t mind buying all our tickets so we can sit together on the way up and back and he agreed to it 100% and said he would go down to the train station the next day and book in person because “sometimes they don’t book you sitting together online” which I found pretty odd because my mum and I have done this trip before and always got a seat together from an online booking. I didn’t think much of it though.

I informed C numerous times to book B and I student tickets so it would be cheaper for us. (N/A for C as he is not in school). 

I called him at 12 - midday and he hadn’t bought them. Then again at 2pm, 4pm and 5pm and he still hadn’t bought them. I texted him at 5:30pm and said the train station would be shut by now, and he said he’s just booking online now. This, I found, quite annoying but not that big of a deal.

The next day, I awoke to a message on Instagram saying B and I owe C $80. I immediately knew he had booked the adult tickets for us, and told him I’m not paying $80 as I told him earlier we want the student tickets because it is cheaper. C got mad at me and hasn’t talked to me since. The student tickets are $56.

I pull up and get out thinking this is some pervert who was trying to get pictures of my family or something. So I walked up to him and asked what was going on.

She works for some company that mortgage companies reach out to and have them get photographs to confirm someone is living there. That makes sense because I was behind on my mortgage and whenever I would talk to them they would ask if I was living there and planning on keeping the house. The guy showed me the list of houses he had on the app and it gave him the best route, all the stuff. So I apologize for approaching him that way, he laughed it off and I walked away.
 THEN the police show up and ask what's going on. I explained everything I just listed and told them it's no big deal we sorted it out. They didn't care and asked for our ID anyways. They told me to sit tight while they talked to him. After a few minutes they put him in handcuffs and returned my ID.

I slammed my hand on the table and got up and left the classroom. I was so mad, I’m usually such a calm person but I think I just got overwhelmed. I didn’t  know where to go so I went to the counsellors office and thankfully her door was open. I knocked on it and she could see I was sobbing so she invited me in and asked me what happened and why I wasn’t in class. I told her the story through sobs and was sympathetic but told me I couldn’t act like that in class and it was disrespectful. Because “regardless of what is happening at home, you can’t disturb classes” this probably would’ve set me off but I was crying too much to care. She sent me back to class but I just left school and went home.

I’ll call the sender A (F17) and the other friend B (F17). 

Context: 
I’m still good friends with my ex (F17), it was kind of a relationship that shouldn’t have happened because of how long distance it was and neither of us were really in the right with how codependent we were. We broke up a few months ago because she kept initiating arguments over how frequently we called (neither of our schedules overlapped well enough and we spent time doing stuff together off call), how frequently we’ve been able to spend time with each other (when the fall semester started) and how she didn’t feel like I loved her at all, a few of these instances were when she was intoxicated with A and B. 

I know that A and B also told her to break up with me and caused her to cry while with them on a number of occasions because of what they said and the advice they gave about our relationship. It seemed a lot like every time she would hang out with them she’s just text me something mean and I started getting irritated and I was more avoidant which made it worse. She also confided in me about how they were a bit mean to her sometimes and how things were draining with them sometimes. (Ironically enough she also thought A liked B)

I would like to think that I was pretty clear that I did care about her a lot but I have an existing history of everyone that I got close to getting tired of me and I felt like I was waiting for her to come to that conclusion. All that is said and done though and we’ve worked though mostly everything. I want to hope that we can continue to be friends and we’ve been spending time together almost like how we were before we dated since we had been friends more more than a year and a half before that. 

The actual situation: 
I received a wrong number text from friend A that was meant to friend B that said that friend A likes my ex. I initially thought they were fucking with me because they don’t like me, had previously fucked with me, and employed me to send mean texts like that to people that they didn’t like. I sent it to my ex, turns out B and I have similar enough names in A’s contacts for it to be plausible that it was an accident.

My ex doesn’t see how it’s weird that A was giving so much aggressive advice to her about our relationship. I feel screwed because I felt a shift when my ex was hanging out with A and B more and getting their advice but my ex doesn’t see that.

In December 2021,  my cousin, C, and his wife, J, invited my sibling, fiance, cousin K, and me to their home for a “kids night.” While there, Jen kept asking prying questions like “what annoying things does your mom do”  or “your mom told your aunt that you were at your fiance’s house at 10pm.” I tried to respond carefully bc I found this really suspicious. my cousin lied &amp; told my aunt that my fiance &amp; I called their house ugly which was not true &amp; made my aunt really mad. I didn't know this until after we were back home. We actually said it was funny that my aunt apologized for how the house looked when we thought that it looked great. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't talked to my other cousin, D, since I was 15. He accused my aunt &amp; grandma of being abusive in the past. And my aunt thought that he was going to kill her at some point. He got back in touch with my aunt about 2 years ago but he's never contacted me directly

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, my mom asked my sibling, husband, and I to fly to my aunt’s house for Christmas, and they would pay for the tickets. Normally, I would consider this, but my husband and I have been saying for over a year that we’re going to alternate whose family we spend Christmas with. We can’t do both families because his family lives in the same city we do and my family has gone back to doing every Christmas 15+ hours away. Also, selfishly, I just want to have a peaceful, drama-free Christmas this year. I told her that we’ve been saying that this Christmas is with my husband’s family. She then explained that this is a special year because David and his family are going to be there this year, and it is my aunt’s Christmas dream to have the whole family together for the first time in so long. They won't be there next Christmas when my husband and I will be because they’ve already planned a trip to Disneyland at that time. We asked for a few days to think about it, but ultimately decided to stick to our original plan which my husband’s family was grateful for. I was in the car with my mom when she asked what our decision was. I told her, and she proceeded to not speak to me for a solid 15 minutes which was extremely awkward. My dad later said that he heard about our choice and that he was proud of me for setting boundaries and that he didn’t want to go either. Since then, my mom has continued to bring it up and attempted to guilt me. For example, saying that since we’re not going, she might not be able to go at all if my sibling decides not to go. She’s also said that she wishes we’d change our minds because she could say that our whole family was together for Christmas for the first time in 8 eight years. My sibling and I have been there every year barring the covid year. My sibling is still deciding if they’re going to go

My baby shower is next week, and is being hosted by my boyfriend’s (22M) family. This is the first time my family will meet his. My mother (42F), upon invitation seemed uninterested. She doesn’t like big gatherings/new people. I said that I would really like to have her there, as she is my mother and this is my first child, as well as the need to meet my BF’s family. So she agreed, but said she would be bringing my brother. My brother is 5 years old. We aren’t close due to the age gap, and most of our interaction consisted of me babysitting after I moved out. My brother has SEVERE behavioral issues. And my mother refuses to discipline him, claiming it will make him worse and he can’t understand he is doing anything wrong. This means all of her free time is devoted to him, and his issues. He is never told no. 
Based on this, I told her that I didn’t know if it would be the best idea. The shower is being held at a new place, by new people, and there would not be a lot for him to do there. I was worried his behavioral issues would take over, and said that he can’t act out in a strangers house, and that I want to avoid any arguing or my mother having to leave early due to my brother being bored or misbehaving. She does this regularly at the expense of others, specifically myself. A lot of work has gone into this shower, I really don’t want anything to ruin it. While I can’t know that it’ll go badly, I would rather her leave him at home, so that she can focus on the shower and me. She was not okay with this. She said that if he couldn’t come, she wouldn’t either. I told her I was very disappointed, but if that is her decision, I would have to be okay with it. When I didn’t fight her, it was “Well, maybe I’ll be there, I don’t know. I guess he doesn’t have to come.” Anytime we talked about it after, she said he wouldn’t be there. Until she called me today and before the call ended, said that my brother was very excited. I asked what she meant. She said that he was so sad he couldn’t go, and she would be bringing him now. Needless to say I was frustrated. I tried to reiterate that I don’t think it is a good idea. She said that it shouldn’t matter, and I didn’t need to make this about me. He shouldn’t make a difference in how the day goes. I know he will though. Behavior aside, I know he will be her focus the entire time. She won’t be engaged in meeting the family, she won’t be willing to participate in anything. She likely won’t even talk to me very much, as she has done at every event he’s been to.

I suffer from depression, and I was always open to her about it, but I realized that whenever I spoke about my problems, she ended up being indirectly affected, and it made her feel very bad, so I chose to hide what I did, so as not to hurt her, and let her down. after about 2 months of relationship, I realized that she also hid things from me, things that she suffered and etc.... I completely understood and didn't blame her, and after a while, we decided to open up to each other a lot more, because for both of us, it was important to open up to people, especially the people we love. So, we got to the situation. Me and my girlfriend were exchanging poems that we made for each other, and I was having a lot of fun doing it, but I could see that she was really down, and it was almost like she was sad. when I asked what it was, she said it was fine, and that I didn't need to worry. After talking for a while, I realized that she kept showing signs that she was sad, and when I asked what was going on, she still said that everything was fine, and that she was happy.

During the pandemic I fell down a Netflix/youtube rabbit hole and ended up rediscovering my love for comic book movies and comics in general. When everything opened up I decided to start collecting single issue comic books, in particular the original run of Hellblazer. I’m really lucky to have an amazing comic shop near me and one day I went in and noticed that they had an original copy of the first issue. I couldn’t afford it at the time (around £70) but I saved up and eventually managed to get it.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend is not interested in comics he has often remarked that he finds it odd that I collect them, he thinks it’s childish. I tried to explain my love of it but in the end I gave up.

About a week ago, I looked in my wardrobe where I keep them and they were gone. I asked him where they were and he said he’d got rid of them. I was devastated, this was two years of work that I had put into a collection and something that was very dear to me. He simply said that it was a childish hobby and something I should’ve grown out of years ago. I’ll admit I said some pretty unkind things and then stormed out. I went to the pub and turned off my phone, after a couple of hours I turned it back on again to find loads of missed calls and texts saying that I was overreacting and that I was only proving his point that I was childish in the way I had behaved. The last text said he was staying at a friend’s house while I cooled down because he ‘couldn’t be arsed with my dramatics’

 After thinking for a long time I texted him back to say that we were over, I had no interest in being with someone who disrespects my property or my interests and that he could come and pick up his stuff between 6pm and 10pm that evening. He replied with ‘fine, if you’re really going to end a 4 year relationship over something so petty then you’re not the person I thought you were.’

Our relationship had been rocky for a couple of months by then I think this was just the final nail in the coffin.

I went home and packed his clothes and electronics, now this may be where I was the arsehole. I decided that I didn’t want to see him so I left his belongings on the doorstep which is covered by a porch. When I left for work the next morning his stuff was still there so I texted him to remind him but got no answer, halfway through my shift my phone started blowing up with texts and calls from him and his friend saying that I was a bitch for leaving his stuff outside ‘what if it had rained/what if someone had taken it etc.’

All his stuff was in sealed cardboard boxes and I taped plastic binbags over them so if there was rain then they wouldn’t get damaged, we also live in a quiet neighbourhood where everyone knows each other and it wasn’t bin day so I doubt anyone would have taken them.

Hi y'all, so this is relatively recent but I want to get it out there, I'm mostly posting this as a confession because I've never really done anything like this. (Apologies for any spelling / grammar errors English is not my strong suit)

So a while ago, my girlfriend broke up with me, of course I was hurt but what happened next really hurt. My best friend started dating her, the night we broke up. Now I'm not the sharpest cookie in the cupboard, but I could tell something was going on between them. I guess I was just blinded to it at the time but in retrospect, it's all clear now, the constant texts and calls, always wanting to hangout, going on hikes together, etc.

So the the other day, I was particularly upset about the situation and decided to get back at who was my best friend. He made it clear to me and all the people in the friends group that he had a bunch of illegal firearms stashed around the city we live. At first I was like whatever, he has them and never plans on using them so no harm no foul, but then, he did this to me. So I did what I had been thinking about doing and reported him to the ATF and the local PD.

Now for the part I'm questioning myself. He lives with his family and he won't go down without a fight, so I've put them in the crossfire if anything happens.

Am I the asshole?

I (26m) have been with my (24f) girlfriend for about 3 years now, let’s call her Viv. We started dating in 2019 after my breakup with my then girlfriend, now (23f), of 6 years Laney. Our relationship is perfect Viv is quiet &amp; incredibly doting on all my needs. She is quite literally the /perfect/ girlfriend but now I’ve noticed a change that my brain has confused her &amp; my ex.

I like my space &amp; truthfully am not the clingy type. I mentioned in the beginning of us dating that I felt overwhelmed with my last ex due to the fact that she always wanted to be together. Viv reassured me that she loved her space &amp; that she understood my needs, this had me feeling like Viv was my soulmate. Now as of late Viv wants to start spending more time together, going out on dates again. I humor her &amp; tell her there’s nothing out there we can’t do at home. She’ll drop it but honestly it seems as if I was manipulated because she never mentioned this before in the beginning.

Now to the most recent event, over dinner she told me she bought two tickets to an orchestra event I asked her why since she’s never mentioned liking orchestra she said it seemed fun &amp; I told her why we should stress about requesting days off &amp; going to something that isn’t guaranteed we’ll enjoy. She sighs and we start to go back &amp; forth for a few moments and afterwards Viv is teary eyed and throwing a fit giving me deja vu.

Laney got diagnosed with autism about a year before we broke up. When we argued she would tell me about her feelings usually loud &amp; sobbing. She would tell me when she was “overstimulated” what felt like a codeword for temper tantrum, she’d go into the spare room for an hour &amp; collect herself before talking to me. Viv on the other hand has always been calm when we have discussions so I’ve always felt her maturity was pronounced. Which makes addressing issues easy, but during this fight it seemed like she was an inconsolable mess, the same as Laney.

I told her that she knew how much I didn’t like how me &amp; my ex fought, she comforted me whenever me &amp; Laney argued during the relationship &amp; after the breakup she was my shoulder. I asked why she was acting so different.

There was a pause of silence before she went silent &amp; said that it felt as if I “didn’t even like her” I was so exhausted from the topic that I said “Laney you’re crazy” she asked me to repeat myself accusing me of cheating on her (I have not ever, after our breakup she blocked me on everything). Before I could correct myself she called me an ahole, grabbed her keys &amp; left. I haven’t heard from her in 2 weeks, our anniversary is soon &amp; while my friends reassure me shes out of line my sister &amp; mom are telling me its me. AITA?
