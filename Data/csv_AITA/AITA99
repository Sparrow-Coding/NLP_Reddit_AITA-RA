We've been friends for a long while and I'm talking before middle school. 

In our apartment, I have my own bathroom and typically keep all my essentials under my sink; pads, makeup, toilet paper, etc. I work long hours and I only use a certain amount of toilet paper every time I wipe so I don't go through toilet paper very fast.

I am single. Have been for a long time and don't see myself finding a SO for a long while still and I'm content with that. I have toys to keep myself engaged and happily pleasured and I clean them after each session. I keep them under my bathroom sink while they dry after a cleaning and when not in use, a tote under my bed so they're not in plain sight in my room.

I used them the night before this incident and aparently forgot to put one away after I cleaned it so it was sitting on my bathroom sink.

I got home from work the other night and he was sitting in our living room on his phone but looked up and said we needed to talk. I asked him what, he said my room. I asked what the problem was and he looked a bit uncomfortable and said that he saw my toys. I asked him what he meant and he said that he went into my bathroom and saw one on the counter and 2 more under the sink and said it was disgusting to just leave them out. Aparently after finding them, he peeked around my room and also found my tote under my bed and found my other toys.

I'm not going to lie, I went ballistic. I asked him why he was in my room and he said he needed toilet paper because he was almost out. I told him that doesn't give him the right to go into my room unannounced and when I'm not home, much less search my room to see if I had more. He said that he wouldn't have said anything if one wasn't on the counter and he overlooked them in the past. Turns out, it was a regular occurrence for him to go into my room while I wasn't home and borrow my things. He said his reason for bringing it up was because it was unsanitary to leave one on my bathroom sink and accused me of being a sex addict because of how many toys I have and that he's concerned for my health due to my toys. I do have a few more than most people but I've explored what I like and don't like and some were expensive so I'm not going to throw them out and I can't return or gift them. So some are used rarely or not at all.

I told him he didn't have the right to go into my room and bathroom and told him to go fuck himself because he doesn't get to control what I buy nor do in my free time unless I'm not making rent or being able to pay for our shared bills.

Since then, I have not spoken to him and he's avoiding looking at me or being in the same room. 

I did ask a friend and she thinks I may've been too hard on him but I don't feel bad at all.

Our families have been discussing our marriage. My girlfriend's family has been delaying the marriage giving excuses every couple of months and pushing the date. The reason for this being we belong to different communities (caste) and my girlfriend looks after most of the family responsibilities. It has been a more than one and a half year now with this going on.

Few weeks back my girlfriend told me she wants to take up a job closed to where her parents are and probably expecting to continue this relationship long distance after marriage. But things don't end there, she has decided not to have kids as she already have enough responsibilities and having kids will make it difficult for her. In past we have discussed about having children, even discussed about names and this was never an issue. Her parents have few medical issues (nothing life threatening) and I expect and support her to continue to take care of them. But not having kids is a make or break situation for me. I had to tell her if this is her final decision I cannot continue this relationship and we need to breakup rather than ending in a failed marriage in following years. We talked and she had a month to decide and let me know (one week now). But as time is coming to an end I am confused. I love her, but I do want a family with child.

When I first met him he was sweet and kind to me, but slowly I started noticing how he would act so differently when his friends were around. He was one of those ”tough guy cliches” if you can call it that. We only dated for about 6 months so I guess I really didn't get to see the other side of him. 

Slowly I felt like he was losing interest in me and he always found something to fight about. Something that he could blame on me so I would have to apologize and feel like the bad guy. I tried breaking up with him many times but it would always end in messy fights and me apologizing. It’s like he wouldn’t let me break up with him. Now that I look back on those days I feel like he didn’t like me, he liked controlling me.

For context I am a small female and he was much larger than me. So at this point I was scared of him, scared to even suggest breaking up with him face to face. So I did what all my friends had been telling me to do and I broke up with him over text.

My phone started flooding with calls and voice messages telling me what an awful person I am and how I lied to him about loving him how and that I’ll never find someone like him. Most of the voice messages were just him swearing and calling me names. I blocked him shortly after but before that I saved a couple of the voice messages he sent, just in case he ever did something. 

After a couple weeks of not hearing anything from him I played back those voice messages. My coping mechanism has always been humor so I did what I do the best, laughed at those voice messages. After I listened to them a couple times I thought it kind of sounded like he was rapping so I downloaded a soundtrack off youtube and edited them together. Added a beat and I had a song. Even though deep down I knew that I wasn’t the bad guy in the relationship the voice messages still made me feel like it. So to get some support I played the song to my friends. I felt like it was a lighter way to show them the hate filled voice messages and we ended up laughing about it. I never posted the song anywhere but it did become a running joke between our friend group.

Unfortunately through some way my ex heard the song. He was absolutely furious. He has sent me multiple threats telling me that I made a joke out of him and made him look stupid. I have tried blocking him multiple times but he won’t stop and now I feel like the whole song was such a stupid idea.

I have never met his entire friend group either. The night we got there we had planned to go pregame at his friends house and then go bar hopping. From the very beginning I felt like he didn’t really want me to come and even had long talks with him before the night about how this meant a lot to me because I have only ever met one of his friends. The week prior I event went out and bought three different outfits because I really wanted to make a good impression. The car ride there he started saying how it was only going to be all guys and everyone was going to be smoking which isn’t my type of environment so I decided I would not go and instead dropped him off. I did ask him to let me know who was in the house. When I got to his family’s house I had received a text message that there were two girls which two of his guy friends were talking to and even his brother brought his girlfriend. I instantly felt a pit in my stomach. I was so hurt because this was something I really wanted to be a part of and he made it seems like the night was going to be completely different than what it really was. We had multiple calls because I just wanted to drive back to my family house and spend thanksgiving somewhere I was comfortable. He ended up convincing me to stay and I picked him up three hours later to try and talk it out. He claims that I ruined his time with his friends by making it about me. He also says that it’s not his fault because he didn’t know there was going to be his friend’s girls there even tho I asked him to ask them a hundred times.

My wife (27f) and I (27m) live with her elderly parents in a 3 bedroom house.  Everyone usually gets along, but there are just some things that seem to light a fire. Examples are my wife cannot use the house vacuum cleaner under any circumstance. She had to go to the store to buy her own so that she could vacuum the house. My wife cannot use the washing machine, as my MIL doesn't like people touching it. Now, we help around the house with anything - no complaints. We (mostly my wife) always clean up after everyone and take care of the general things in the house, animals included. We pay around 650$ in rent (a blessing in itself) and that more than covers electricity (solar powered house), water, gas, internet, and more with leftover. Her parents are very well off and we are just graduated from college both starting our careers in teaching. 

Now, the battle that I'm having is that if I am in the shower more than 7 minutes, my MIL opens the bathroom door and tells me to hurry up. After 10 minutes, I'm being told to get out. Anything after 10 minutes is her coming to the bathroom and yelling about me being in the shower too long. This is an every day occurrence, exactly the same. It's as if the moment I enter the shower, a timer goes off and im being monitored for every minute I take. This has been going on for years (together with my wife 10 years).  I am very particular in my hygiene habits and do a full routine. It usually takes me between 12-15 minutes ddpending on if I shave. It's to the point where I'm considering packing my clothes and driving to my parents house or the gym to take a shower.  It stresses my wife out and if I mention anything about showering elsewhere or renting a place, my MIL flips a lid.  Also, my wife and I are limited to 1 towel each for a week. We are not allowed to grab new towels as my MIL says we use too many and has to use the washing machine too much on towels.

I work full time and I am the default parent. Husband stays home with our one year old. We’ve had issues the entirety of our marriage, mainly due to his untreated mental illness and also his alcoholism. We also share four children. 

After he released after a six week stint in a rehab facility, I have been making moves to proceed with divorce. I’ve been sitting on the papers, with the desire to serve him and officially file after the holidays. I feel like he’s known this, as his behavior very recently improved a bit. Less time in our basement area drinking, and more time trying to be engaged. 

For context, he struggles with every single holiday and all birthdays. He wakes up in a miserable mood every time, and it’s the most draining thing. I’ve bared my teeth through all major holidays for many years now. But this morning felt good. I got up with our youngest, and got going. I cleaned up our home (a wreck since all four kids and husband were home yesterday). I got the kids up, turned on the parade and got going on breakfast. Husband seemed okay this morning. 

Our youngest began fussing for some milk. Husband told our oldest daughter to ask me, in the midst of breakfast prep to get her a bottle. I told her that she’d need to wait since I was very busy. My husband then got up, huffing the whole time. He then got irritated that I placed a bowl in the sink and I was in his way. He then tossed the sippy cup into the sink. 

Now fully irritated, I prepped the sippy cup and gave it to my daughter. I’ll admit, I was pissed and I don’t mask emotions well. He angrily asked me what my problem was and when I snipped back “nothing” he lost it. He took his unopened Pepsi van and smashed it on the floor. Pepsi was everywhere. All in my food I was cooking, all up my back, on my ceiling. I LOST it. I told him to get out of my face, that I have divorce papers he will be served with Monday, and that I am packing myself and the kids up and leaving.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plan. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it  was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case! 

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plain. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too. 

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

Just before the trip, my brother lost his job as a barback, and during the trip his cat ran away (back now, but still sucked to find out then). 

Historically, even though we are close in age and grew up in the same household, we have had very different lives. He always struggled in school, almost didn’t graduate high school, hasn’t really dated anyone, and is often fired for attitude problems or sloppiness. I skipped a grade, went to MIT, have a high paying job that I like, have dated many people, and live in a nice apartment. Basically, we are under some kind of a cosmic curse where I’ve gotten the things he never did, and it seems unfair. My mom is a pediatrician and in addition to paying for the trip to Alaska, has given him a car, helps him out with rent, insurance, bills, etc when he needed it. Since he lost his job he can’t pay rent this month, so my mom agreed to pay it for him.

During the trip, he was a nightmare of complaining and condescension. He tripped while hiking and started cursing out the forest and throwing rocks at it. We took a ferry which was delayed so he started loudly complaining and insulting people for the rest of the day. I got sick and he told me it was my fault. The wi-fi wasn’t good everywhere we went and that was a problem too.

It all came to a head when he started talking about an elderly woman we have known our entire lives, who is living in a building owned by our grandmother. My grandmother needs to sell the building but can’t because this family friend (or maybe former friend) has been living there for decades and refuses to move out. As if we haven’t known this woman our whole lives, my brother started talking about how she needs to be evicted, get a job, stop being a leech, and he doesn’t care if she ends up on the street. I couldn’t take it anymore and I told him that as someone who also cannot currently pay his rent, he shouldn’t be so quick to jump on evicting an old woman since he’s in basically the same situation, and should at the very least have some empathy. 

He cursed me out, threw a carrot, called me a shit heel and said I should not stoop so low to bring up his current situation when it has nothing to do with this dispute between our family friend and our grandma. 

Was I the asshole to bring up him not being able to pay his rent when things have been relatively easy for me? Was he the asshole for being so gung-ho about evicting an old woman?

We're both neurospicy people, and when we met I'd warned him about my severe anxiety disorder, to which he said he had the same and more so he understood etc. 

Generally speaking, he's been good to me. I've supported him through his mother's death, and a 6-month job loss (I kept him fed and paid for his bank loan).He was depressed on and off for months, but I stayed with him and supported him as much as I could, all the while pushing away and ignoring the problems I had in my own life. 

The issue rose with his frequent tiredness and inability to stay away. Once every 2-3 times, I'd come over and he would barely acknowledge I'm there due to being so tired, he couldn't wake up. 

I had ascribed it to his depression (mother, job), but honestly? Before all that, he slept through the NY holiday. He got high as a kite, and didn't acknowledge me the whole night. I stayed, feeling lonely as heck, and after I left the next day, he slept for another 20+ hours. No texts, nothing. Sometimes, I couldn't help but feel miserable. I'd have gaming widow ex-boyfriend flashbacks, and go back to a very dark time of my life, in my head, and I'd break down in tears in front of him every time. He kept promising he'd try to not be dead when I was around, but it'd only happen for a week or two or three, and then back to the same old. 

He got a job and became close with his coworkers. So much that he's super close with the girls, texts them a lot, and often leaves me waiting for texts back. I've spoken to him about it, and he makes excuses (it's my phone, oh I was online bc a coworker who isn't in today texted me, etc). On top of that, every second or third time since he's started work, he's again 'so tired' he basically huffs and puffs and barely has time for us. He'd be upset when I would say I'd go home if he slept bc there's no point in me being there. He'd say 'are you gonna do that when we live together? How is this supposed to work if you wanna leave every time I fall asleep?' but that's not even the issue, and I explained it, or I thought I had.

It's gotten so bad that the last two times we met, I broke down in tears several times. I feel so lonely, and I keep trying to tell him because he asked what was wrong, but he just flipped the story to me lacking understanding about his tiredness. Not to mention, he initiated sex that second time, and literally fell asleep. 

So basically AITA? I do cry a lot, and I feel shitty bc it must be a burden to him, but at the same time, I'm not doing it bc I'm bored. Please, be honest, and ask me anything, as I feel like my post might still be vague.

  Me and a few co workers go to the bar after work and they decided to invite our engineer. We're drinking having a good time and he starts talking trying to flirt with this girl but she's not really feeling it. She starts asking me about all my tattoos and sits next to me. Me and her are having a conversation and he keeps trying to make his way into it.
 
 She asks how we all know each other and I tell her we all work together. He interjects that ""Well I wouldn't say that we work together I'm an engineer, He's just a field hand. I actually had to get a degree for my job"".

 I was completely taken aback because it was so out of nowhere because we do work together and have to coordinate together to do our jobs we just have different positions. I had a few drinks so I pretty bluntly replied with ""since youre the one who brought it up, I just think its crazy how you have to pay back student loans just to make almost 40k less than me""
 
 He got pretty upset called me a dick and grabbed his stuff and left. After he leaves she said he's seems really stuck up and pretentious.

My (25F) roommate (28F) is from out of the country. She's lived in the States for four years and she doesn't really have any close friends besides me. Frankly, that's no one's fault but her own. I've tried introducing her to different friend groups on multiple occasions and no one enjoys spending time with her (They view her as self absorbed and a bit narcissistic/selfish, which I don't disagree with.) I've pushed her to explore our city on her own, but she chooses to stay in her room for months at a time and cites her mental health as the reason. That being said, even though it gets frustrating I'm a person who likes to keep peace and ""be friends with everyone""; but in keeping things friendly I've lacked boundaries, and now I feel like this person's only source of genuine human interaction for months at a time. She calls me her only friend, which is an insane amount of pressure, especially since she's depressed. She's also 100% the type who will toss me aside when she eventually has ""better"" friends, so I've been a good friend to her and patiently waited, but I'm realizing after two years living together that that time isn't coming.

Anyway, point of the story is I'm her only plan for Thanksgiving. She wants to go to a bar or something and just say ""fuck it"" to the whole holiday. I hesitantly agreed when I didn't have plans. But Yesterday, my group of extended friends realized I wasn't flying home this year and invited me to their dinner. But here's the thing: only me. They told me my roommates personality makes them uncomfortable, and that I can bring her as an absolute last resort but it's not optimal. I don't want to be an asshole and leave her alone; but there's also a 65% chance she'll say shes ""too tired to go out"" at 6PM and do the same to me so she can stay in bed.

This is a particularly hard Thanksgiving for me- the first time Im not going home because my grandmother passed a month ago. I know I'll be particularly angry if she cancels because I can't be alone today; frankly I'd rather be around friends who care about me anyway, but don't want to sacrifice the friendly nature of my home for two weeks in the process.

I’ll just say that right here. Throughout my childhood, he was the kind of father who would work from 5 AM to 8 PM to provide. While I do heavily respect him, he still wasn’t in my life much. The only thing I don’t respect is that he only worked this much because he pampered my mom (f50). I’m mentioning this because my family all says “he worked so hard for *you*, don’t disrespect him” even though he has made it clear that that is not the case.

Anyways, in these past 3 years my dad and mom went through a rough divorce. They both HEAVILY turned to alcohol, and my dad turned to alcohol and drugs. They both became abusive towards me and my 3 siblings (who are all under 16). My siblings and I have tried to do 50/50 with my parents, but they would not cooperate, so I ended up living with my aunt for months. This is when I started grudging my parents. 

Throughout the 3 years, I have told my mom and dad to go to rehab, get a therapist, something just to help. I’ve even given them sources. Eventually, my mom came around and got into some counseling at our local church, got a job, and started turning her life around again. School was starting and since my mom didn’t have good living conditions, me and my siblings stayed with my dad. While staying with my dad, he refused to take us to school for weeks, refused to go to rehab, took heavy drugs (coke, mushrooms, etc) in front of us and even drove us around while UTI. This made me grudge my dad even more. He has scarred my young siblings, and with barely a memory of a dad, that’s how we remember him.

My family is all super religious, and they all (especially my dad, himself) yell at me (calling me selfish) for refusing to forgive my dad.

We have been together for a year and a half and it will be two years by the time we officially move in.
     I want to get a job in my uni town to save up money as well as start to gain more independence bc my parents have been overly controlling since my early teen years. They searched my phone every night until I was 16, constantly tracked my location, enforced a 9pm bedtime until I was 16, and they get angry when I make decisions for myself (like changing my major from what they wanted me to do). I’ve tried to talk to them but they always shut me down and tell me I am just a child.
      When I told them I wanted to stay in my uni town over the summer so I can work and move in with my bf, they got angry and immediately said no. I was planning on them helping me pay for housing expenses through undergrad but I can support myself if I really need to. They said I am too young to make these decisions and they know what’s best for me and I am not allowed to stay in my uni town or move in with my bf.
      I understand that they’re still my parents and I’m only 19 but I’m tired of being forced to do what they want instead of what will make me happy. I feel like I owe it to myself to do something just for me rather than always doing what they say because they’re “older and know what’s best”. I love my bf very much and there’s always the chance that we do not last but I want this and the future we have talked about together.

She has been in China for 12-14 years, is married to a Chinese man, and never had a chance to meet in person since then. We had long talks before me going, on those calls I asked if she could translate for me, and she said yes. Even though, I bought a little Chinese travel dictionary, and downloaded a translation app that I could use in the country.

I arrived, meet my sister, her husband, and things were ok at the beginning, but in the next days I noticed that she wasn't translating for me. At some place I asked her to please translate for me, but she refused, then I tried to use the app but the results were in broken english, so I asked some staff members member if they knew english, lucky for me, they spoke english, but my sister was angry.

She told me that if I was coming to China, should have put more effort to learn the language. I told her that I was doing what I could, but she said I was being an entitled foreigner expecting others to mold to my needs.

It became these since then, I tried to enjoy what I could, memorized some words, learned some phrases, but without a reliable translator, it was difficult to navigate, some people knew at least a few words in english, but I was feeling lost most of the time, so cut my vacation short and went back home.

My sister keeps telling me that I didn't put any effort in learning, and acted like other selfish tourists and disrespected the people by asking them to speak in english.

One thing that still haunts me is she saying ""They might smile at you, but inside, they are want you to go away, the chinese are like that"".

Also, her husband never spoke a word directly at me.

He will take advantage of other people as long as he can. This has led to the end of his marriage with my MIL, and stained relationships with my wife and the rest of her family. He has been like this his entire life.

Last Christmas my (30M) FIL ended up in the hospital. He had been putting off feeling ill since last April, and it all came to an end last December where he landed himself in the hospital with undiagnosed/untreated diabetes and blood sugar of 1500. Due to his his undiagnosed diabetes he suffered a blood clot and while he was in the hospital one leg had to be amputated at the knee. If he took care of himself he wouldn’t have lost his leg. He went from the hospital to a nursing home where he went through therapy and learned to walk with a prosthetic. He also has a wheelchair.

Immediately after he got out of the nursing home my BIL &amp; SIL (M &amp; F -both late 30’s) took him in because their house was handicapped accessible. My SIL managed to get a (old) free hospital bed that they put in the small living room.

For the past 6 months my FIL has been living with them rent free and causing nothing but problems. He has refused to use his prosthetic because (in his words) he “doesn’t feel like wearing it.” He has been doing absolutely nothing but sitting in the hospital bed watching TV. He refuses to use the bathroom or take a shower even though (he has admitted) he has no problem using the bathroom or taking a shower. He pees in the living room, in a bottle that keeps by his bed. BIL remodeled their house so a spare room became available and FIL refuses to use that bedroom, taking up space in their small living room. He expects people to cook for him and clean up after him. SIL recently had weight loss surgery and while she was in the recovery room after surgery he called her and asked her to order him a pizza.

If he goes out of the house he uses the wheelchair. He doesn’t use the prosthetic because (again) he doesn’t want to. He wants people to push him around in his wheelchair, open doors for him, and loves the attention.

My wife and I are hoisting Christmas this year. Our house is not handicapped accessible. Since FIL won’t use his prosthetic, we would have to carry him up the steps into the house with him sitting in his wheelchair. Our doorways are not wide enough so he couldn’t navigate throughout the house. He couldn’t get to the living room, dinning room, or even bathroom. We also have a 1 y/o so there are baby gates set up, “permanently” screwed into the walls.

My wife and I are both saying he is not welcome if he doesn’t bring the prosthetic he isn’t welcome. I told my wife if he shows up without his prosthetic I will not carry him up our stairs in his wheelchair. He can sit outside for all I care. She agrees.

Now, I personally don’t bother shaving my legs, it takes too long, I have limited time in the shower, it’s winter so my legs aren’t really out, they’re blonde so you can’t even see unless you’re directly looking, shaving causes me sensory issues (i’m autistic), and I genuinely just don’t care enough. 

My dad (47) noticed and started laughing, saying ‘maybe we need to get you a razor for Christmas,’ and making other little comments. He tried calling my mum, who had left the table, to come and look at my ‘hairy legs’. I started getting a bit upset as while I personally don’t care about my legs, I felt humiliated. (I used to be severely bullied so when he does this it brings up those feelings). 

He straight up asked me why I don’t just shave and I had enough. I simply said ‘shaved legs are probably a paedophilic beauty standard’. Now I don’t necessarily know a lot about this concept it’s just something I read about during research for one of my classes (a subject I take has a topic on feminism) and I really wanted him to back off or change the subject since he’s one of those people who complains about ‘your generation’ and socially alternative things like women dressing masculine, you get the idea.

He then got extremely offended and started getting loudly defensive so I left. He’s not spoken to me all week, until tonight’s dinner. 

My mum (39) showed my little sister (6) her tattoo on her back and I told my sister it was a tramp stamp in passing. My dad then said something along the lines of ‘why do you think you can say those kind of things to people?’ confused, I asked if it was offensive to my mum and she said ‘yeah’. I apologised and said I didn’t realise it was and I didn’t mean to i’ve just heard it referred to that way.

My dad then mumbled something about how I give my mum an actual apology and I don’t apologise for the offensive thing I ‘called’ him. He’s left for work now.

I don’t really want to apologise as he’s always insulting my appearance and i’ve never said anything. Most of the time it’s my body, I’m slim and carry my weight in my legs.

She gave a million excuses why they can’t saying there’s no room in the garage… asking why I would buy an item so far away… said I didn’t need it… how her kids are always “so” busy… etc.

My mother has spoken over the years about the possibility of going to visit but this has never materialised. 

I am a new(ish) mother and have been wanting to visit my family since giving birth. After talking to my family in Australia, the elders are not getting any younger and I have the opportunity to go in January. 

This was decided two days ago. My mother and I have had a rough few years together but we’re working on our relationship. 

This evening I told my mum I was visiting in January to which she replied with how upset she was with me for not including her in the planning. How she feels not good enough and not a part of my life.

Regardless of us expressing this, she continues to dive into relationships fast while expecting our family to dive in with her before we're ready. 

A few weeks ago my fiance's parents decided they were going to host Thanksgiving dinner, and told me I could invite my sister.

It all started a couple of weeks ago when I [m22] posted my couch on my country’s version of Craigslist for $750. (For simplicity I will just refer to it as craigslist from now on.) I attached some pictures, and wrote a description along the lines of “The couch is in good condition, and has been handled with care”. 

It’s a nice quality couch, which I got from my mother when I moved out of my parents house. The price of the couch is $2200 brand new. However my mother bought it off someone else on craigslist for only $200, as they where in a rush to get it out of their house because they were moving houses. 

Couple of weeks go by, but no one seemed interested. I had had one lady coming over to see it in person, and offered me $500 as she thought it had more wear and tear than she thought it would. I declined the offer as I believed it was worth more than that. 

Another week goes by, and then Buyer contacts me. At this point she hasn’t seen the couch in person, only in pictures and offers me $500. As a university student money is tight and with Christmas being just around the corner I accepted her offer, and we agree on a day to come pick it up. 

A couple of days later Buyer shows up with her boyfriend to pick it up. They have a quick look at it inside my apartment, before I help them carry it outside. I live in a small apartment with narrow hallways so it was a challenge to get it out of my apartment. When we get outside Buyers boyfriend tells her that he thinks it might be in worse condition than they would have liked. Buyer on the other hand shrugs her shoulders and asks me for my cash app handle. She sends me the money, and get on their way. 

A couple of days go by, and I have replaced my old couch when I get a message from Buyer demanding a $100 refund. She states that when they got home they discovered it was in way worse condition than they thought it was when they bought it. They said my ad was deceiving and therefore meant I had to refund them $100 for “tricking them to buy the couch”. They said they saw it straight away when they got it out in daylight. But felt it was hard for them to refuse the sale when we had worked so hard to get it out of the apartment and attached a picture of some spots on one of the pillows. I explain to them that this isn’t possible as I have already spent all the money and if they felt like it was in worse of a condition than they would’ve liked they should have said something, instead of paying me and walking of with my couch. This turns in to an argument over text and long story short I stick to my guns and refuse to refund any money.

Tuesday night I get a text from my friend asking if his gf could bring the dog over earlier in the day because her parents were coming earlier than expected. I agreed. My friend responds “great she’ll be over at 730 am.” So now what was supposed to be an overnight thing turned into a whole day of dog sitting. I was fine it with because I work from home, but it did prevent me from doing my normal routine (errands, gym, etc.) on top of preventing me from being able to go out last night (this dog isn’t good around other dogs either.)

My parents are very religious and homophobic but they're very kind people and even though they don't like me being gay, they let me be and don't really criticize me or do anything to stop me from being who I am they just don't like to get involved in my love life. In all my 10 years of being out of the closet they have never wanted to meet any of my partners, and when I came out they had a very extreme negative reaction. Since I came out, they have slowly been calming down and accepting the idea that I'm gay, but they're still very much struggling. A couple years ago (while I was still with my ex) we agreed they wouldn't be involved in my romantic life, and I've respected that and so far it been easy cause my previous partner (who I dated for multiple years) was younger and in the closet.

Both my parents said they would be ok inviting my new partner over for dinner. To this day this is the first partner EVER they've been open to meet and the only partner theyve accepted to come to their home.

She said I needed to speak to a therapist, that I had a lack of empathy and it’s scary that I don’t care or maybe I just get off on hurting people.  She then said she hopes I can ‘stop acting out like this’ and that we were clearly never good friends and she doesn’t want me in her life. 

The thing is…..we’ve not really spoken since early 2020, I’ve not seen her in person since 2019. I had no idea she even looked at my stories as I don’t check who views it. She replied to my story in march but since then zero contact. I usually click through stories of people I’m not close to (lesson learned). We were friends for the first year and a half of university in 2018/19 but not like ride or die best friends. 

I replied saying I’m sorry, I had just watched a sad film and I genuinely didn’t see her story, I must have accidentally viewed it and it was not intentional . I also took down the story because I don’t want to upset someone who’s obviously having a bad time. 

Now she’s got our other friend from university to unfollow me and she’s blocked me.

I (25M) have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome around the age of 10. Even though I'm high-functioning and technically had it ""good"", the symptoms were still very debilitating and prevented me from forming connections for the entirety of my teenage years. Over time, I learned how to read the room and control myself to a point where people don't even know I am autistic if I do not tell them.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been seeing my girlfriend (24F) for about three years now, and she has moved in with me four months ago. I sippose the problems began because we were getting too serious, and she wanted to meet my family. I had been extremely hesitant to let her, because I was worried one of them would accidentally drop the topic of my autism, which is not something I wanted her to know about me. While my father (52M) had been respectful to my wish and kept his word, my uncle (45M) disagreed with me on this, and thought I should tell her. I don't blame him for this, keep in mind. He just thought that that was giving into insecurities, which to some extent was true.

&amp;#x200B;

While my uncle and father don't like seeing me insecure, I cannot say the same for my mother (50F) and brother (23M). I had been low contact with them ever since moving out. I can't exactly call them abusive or neglectful, but they made it very clear that they do not respect me and think I'm a huge idiot. Fair enough, I guess. Naturally, I told my girlfriend that I do not see them and that I don't really want them to be part of our life in any capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

A week ago, when coming home from work, I discovered my girlfriend has left with most of her things. I tried calling her, but found myself blocked. At this point, I'm panicking, so I try calling one of the few mutual friends we have. Her friend (20somethingF) didn't really care for either side of the conflict, but she was at least kind enough to share what she knew.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, my girlfriend had arranged a meeting with both my mother and brother behind my back, knowing I was not in contact with them. They not only gave them a piece of their mind about me, but also revealed to her my autism, which apparently shook her up so much she packed bags the following day.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss for ideas. I headed to my uncle's and I'm going to spend some time with him and his family. He's dissapointed and even ticked that the relationship ended that way, but also suggested that her breakup had more to do with my insecurity and lying more than my autism.

And by this i mean that he quite literally hates me. I have no clue why, whenever i’ve asked in the past he gives me a bs excuse and my parents can’t figure it out either. the best idea that my stepdad has come up with is that he’s either jealous that i have a higher paying job than him, or he doesn’t like the fact that i’m queer. Either way, this boy HATES me, so whenever I was at my parent’s house, he would make my life a living hell. Because of this, when i was 18, i chose to live elsewhere until he moved out this year.

Every now and then, i would visit my parent’s house as i still had a room there and i would spend a night or two here and there, but i never stayed very long because of Adam. The last time i visited before i moved back in with my parents, i decided i would clean the house since my parents were gone camping for the week. When i was cleaning the kitchen i found a corner where we had potatoes stored. The potatoes were incredibly rotten and there was nasty potato juice all over the counter. It made the house smell absolutely RANK. I bleached the counter and used a rag to clean everything up. The rag went straight from the counter into the washer where I was going to add more dirty rags to wash all in one load. 

I have adhd and unfortunately forgot to start the washer somehow, but the only thing that needed to be done was adding detergent and pressing start. I came home after work the next day to find all of the dirty rags on the front porch. My brother was the only one home so i asked him “hey did you throw the rags outside?” and he said “yeah, they smelt bad and it’s not my job to clean them.” This bothered me because there were many many times he left huge loads of his laundry in the washer/dryer for someone else to take care of. I told him since he felt the need to throw them outside instead of just starting the laundry, then he can finish cleaning them up.

He refused, so i decided to just leave them there because i was tired of his petty bs at this point. A couple days went by and he asked me “so when are you gonna clean up those rags?” and i told him that since i cleaned up the nasty potato mess (that wasn’t even my problem to deal with anyways) and he felt the need to be petty, he could grow up and take care of it himself. It was more work taking everything out and throwing it outside anyways than it would’ve been to just start the washer. 

The argument escalated and he started saying he was gonna call the cops on me (no reason other than we were arguing) and i told him to do it because he would look like an absolute fool. I called my mom to let her know the situation and she told me to “get the hell out of her house”. this is all after i fully deep cleaned the house to help with everyone’s stress.

My best friend and I has always been close and we have a really good bond. Yesterday we all got a message from our school that we need to bring back our prescribed books, that we had to read, to school and if we have lost it we have to pay the school back to replace them. 

This morning I called my best friend to let her know that I am at my locker and need to get the book and she just said “good luck with that”. I was really confused at her saying this and just brushed it off as nothing. I then went to my locker to get the book but found it nowhere. (My friend occasionally uses my locker to put some of her books in so she has my locker code. I gave her my my code when she broke her knee to make her life a bit easier so that she doesn’t have to carry around a heavy bag all day) 

When I asked her if she accidentally took my book she said just said no and that I probably misplaced mine. I just asked if I could see her book to make sure, because I had a feeling that she had taken my book since she told me a week prior that she can’t find hers. I then took the book to check it and of course it was mine. 

When I kindly informed her that it was in fact my she got mad and snatched it from me telling me it was hers and that I can’t just accuse her of stealing like that. (I never accused her I just thought she may have accidentally took mine and there was a mix up) 

I know she is struggling with money and she probably can’t afford to replace the book (which she most probably lost) but if that is the case she could’ve just told me and I would’ve helped her out. (We’ve always helped each other out like that) 

She gave my book in at school now (she can do that because the school doesn’t check codes or anything, they just assume everyone handed their OWN books in) and now I have to pay for the book. Which will only be like $25. 

I don’t about care paying for the book. But what makes me mad is the fact that she stole it and then lied about it as if I wouldn’t realise she took mine. (Something to note about me. I am a perfectionist. I know where I put all my things adnd everything is well organised. I keep all my book codes to make sure I give mine in. And I always write it down in a note book).

I confronted him, and had confessed that a while before we met this female friend was drunk and told him she had feelings for him and made a move. He shut her down because she had a boyfriend and she said sorry and that she was drunk and they agreed to stay just friends.

(Fake names)

So I (18f) have been best friends with Jenny (18f) for just over 2 years and were in the same friendship group. When I was around 13, I met Harry (19m) when he joined our group. I will admit that I had a big crush on him back then, however it was more of a high school crush that really didn't mean anything. Harry when we met however had a crush on Jenny, they went out for two weeks and then broke up as it was a meaningless high school relationship and both of them moved on. Harry then went on to date someone else in the group for a few months before breaking up with them and then going on to have a massive crush on Jenny. By this point I was over my crush and was honestly just enjoying the drama but it really hurt my self esteem that he seemed to have had a crush on everyone but me. After changing crushes a lot, eventually just before covid hit him and Jenny got back together. While dating, Harry was 100x more invested than Jenny and she spent the entire relationship chatting to and sending nudes to other guys on dating apps, something Harry was aware of but he let slide as he didn't want to break up. Jenny lied about loving him and has admitted that she never really liked him all that much. After us berating Jenny for how she treated Harry they broke up but continued a friends with benefits relationship for over a year.

Anyway, a few months ago I realized I have a pretty big crush on Harry. I've always been attracted to him anyway but his complicated relationship with my best friend as well as being sure he wasn't interested put me off. I pushed it off because of how difficult it is but we ended up starting to talk more by text which we never did before and it kinda gave me hope. Sadly at parties whenever Jenny was present he would seem depressed. I hated myself because I was hoping that Jenny couldn't come to a lot of them because it was more fun when he wasn't depressed. Bare in mind throughout this time everyone was telling him to get some sense and move on from Jenny including me which made me feel guilty cause i was saying it for selfish reasons.

I pushed away the crush for good when he sent me a snap of him and Jenny in bed together, which safe to say crushed all my feelings pretty quickly and I told myself to move on as we were both moving to university. Sadly my time at uni has been horrific and as I am isolated I've been talking to both of them a lot so I know both of them are moving on and I've realized my feelings for Harry aren't over. I feel like he might like me back but I would take my friendship with Jenny over the prospect of a relationship with Harry any day. I know Jenny doesn't care about Harry, however I understand that she still may not be ok with it which is understandable, and if I'm an asshole I would just try to move on.

I (19F) am a very broke student. I am currently unemployed, as I left my last job due to an awful boss and right now I decided to focus on completing my diploma before university (where I live there’s a school level between high school and university).

My father decided to cut me off financially on my birthday aside on from paying for my tuition and groceries since I turned 19 in October and told me to pay my bills myself, which I didn’t complain about. He told me this was the “gift of independence”. Because I am unemployed, and plan to be until the end of my semester (in three weeks) I took the decision to cancel some of my bills, including my phone bill.

I was still on the family plan when he told me, so I told him to simply remove me and I’ll create my own account when I start having an income. He accepted, but not without anger, repeatedly saying “at 19 you should be able to afford this” or “what can I do if I want to contact you”, etc. Before November started, he had me confirm again that I was okay with being removed, and confirmed that he would do it, and I did.

I thought that was it, but yesterday my father came to me asking for the money of my phone bill for November. I was confused: what phone? He then told me he never cut me off because he expected me to change my mind and that I would need to pay for the bill since it was for my number.

However, holidays are usually spent at his family’s house, just because they live closer. My family gatherings are about 30 minutes away. The last time he went to my family’s holidays was Easter in 2021. He will always turn down holidays or gatherings with my family but, we go to his family’s a few times a month. 

This was not the first thing that he has turned down. Outside of the family gatherings, we were supposed to have a date last weekend, he never mentioned it or acknowledged we had plans. We did have a funeral to go to, however that was just for a few hours out of our Saturday. We still could have gone.  I tried to make up for the date by getting him tickets to see one of his favorite Stand Up comedians, I even books a really nice hotel room for that night so we could have a little getaway weekend. Note: I have been putting back $200-$300 each check for almost a year so we could afford something like this. He got really mad and refused to go, I wound up giving my coworker the tickets at no cost and lost my deposit on the hotel room. 

Which leads us to today when he turned down Thanksgiving dinner at my family’s house. He blamed it on the ride and wanting to relax, however he has the next 4 days off of work.

So my cousin (F) 30 recently got engaged to her partner (M) 30. Let's call them Chloe and James.

So Chloe and James have been in a relationship now for about 5-6 years and have two kids together, I've been invited to the wedding reception BUT no plus one, I've been with my husband for 10 years so was a little hurt that he wasn't invited but hey ho I understand that the numbers are limited so it is what it is.

HOWEVER, I recently had a conversation with my brother and his girlfriend has been invited and they have only been together for 3 months. My other brother also has a plus one and he is going to bring a friend. I spoke with my aunt about this and it turns out my husband is not invited because of his religion.

It turns out James does not feel comfortable having my husband at the wedding due to his personal views, and due to a group he has become associated with, a lot of these associates will also be at the wedding.

Obviously this has upset me a lot so I respectfully declined the wedding invite and informed my cousin that I could not attend ( I gave an excuse, and said that I could not get the time off work to attend, I am a nurse and it can be difficult to get time off). Flashforward to this morning brides mother decided to tell her the real reason that I am not attending she has messaged me telling me how I am ruining her day and that I shouldn't care about what her soon to be husband believes as she does not share his views. Now I am not angry at my cousin I understand you can't help who you love and he does seem to be a great dad to their two kids, what I can't stand is the thought of being in a room with a bunch of people who hate my husband (eventhough they've never met him) because of his religion 

I have stood my ground and said that I won't attend as I don't feel it would be a healthy environment for me to be in (if anyone said anything to me about my husband I know I would cause a scene) my cousin has now called a loyalty test and asked the whole family to either choose me and my husband or her and her soon to be husband. Both of my brothers, sister, mum and dad have now said that they won't attend due to the conflict. ( I didn't ask any of them to they have made this decision all based on how my cousin has reacted)

My aunt is saying that I am going to ruin this family and my cousins wedding for declining the wedding invite and that i should be able to sit there and be there to support my cousin on her wedding day.

I have told my husband everything and he fully supports whatever I do he just wants me to be happy and he knows me and my cousin used to be close growing up.

I am very conflicted between accepting the invite and just 'sucking it up' and standing by my original choice.

Her parents were young and weren't ready for kids so I raised her instead, for backstory. 

She recently started working at McDonald's and actually gets pretty good checks from it. we've argued about how she spends her money a few times and the Air Pods were one of our biggest arguments. I told her they were a pointless purchase that she'd just end up losing. She got upset and said she just wanted to buy herself a new pair since someone stole her other pair. 

She recently left her Air Pods in my car and a few days later I showed them to her, telling her i found brand new Air Pods and she instantly got upset saying that they were hers and asking why I never told her I found them. I told her she never said anything about losing them and that she was probably just lying about them being hers, however her name popped up when trying to connect them so I gave them back.

She told me that next time to either tell her anyways or just leave them where they are because she definitely knows where she had them last and the first place she'd check is the place that i took them from. i thought she was being ridiculous but I agreed.

Apparently she lost them again, because she came in last night asking if I'd seen the Air Pods themselves, not the case. I told her that her grandfather had found them and put them in a drawer but I didn't care to watch which one.

She instantly got upset with tears in her eyes slamming open my drawers asking where they were and I told her I didn't know and that she could wait for her grandfather to return. However this seemed to anger her and she told me that I wasn't supposed to let him do that since they were in her room on her bed and it made her think she seriously lost them.

I told her she should be grateful that he even found them and didn't throw them away and she just shook her head and walked away. I followed her, telling her that her attitude and disrespect was unnecessary since I was only trying to help.

For background context, I have struggled immensely with a restrictive eating disorder on multiple different occasions, each one lasting 1+ years long. It's very noticeable because of the amount of weight I loss among other symptoms (like thinning hair and extremely low iron). 

My friends have all been made aware of my struggles and I recently have been doing really well in recovery from it so I've been discussing it more when it's occasionally brought up in conversation.

So here's where the trouble starts.

My (now ex) best friend, K, and I have always struggled with differentiating opinions, so it was pretty normal for us to butt heads a lot. It got to the point where I could bring up any topic of conversation and expect her to try to one-up me or argue against me. 

Yesterday, I mentioned a very specific aspect of my disordered eating that allowed me to lose weight very quickly and she said something along the lines of, ""Oh, that's great... yeah I had an eating disorder once."" When I asked her to expand (because she had me never once seemed interested in my struggle to eat and she had also never mentioned anything about it before) she became quiet cocky. It was almost like she was trying to one-up me.

She explained that when her parents divorced and she lived with her dad, he never kept any food in the house so she only ate at school, not at home. I asked her if she willingly chose to not eat or if it was only because she didn't have access to food and she said it was the latter. 

I tried explaining that while her situation did allow her to have disordered eating habits, it wasn't an actual eating disorder per se. She got extremely pissed and started arguing that because she lost a little weight that that was indictive of her having an eating disorder.

Frankly, I felt a little insulted that she would claim to have a horrible disorder like this that was caused by having a lack of food when she knew of my extremely strained relationship with food. Her ""eating disorder"" was caused by factors outside of her control, so while I know having a lack of food is serious, I don't think it was serious enough to claim that she had an eating disorder.

My friends are all mixed on who was in the right or wrong and I'd never want to hurt any of my friends, especially by discrediting a possible mental health condition that they may have.

So reddit, AITA?

We used to workout together and then as I opened a business, she assisted with working there as well, filling in every so often when needed. We became very close. As she was a stay at home mom, it also gave her the confidence to get back into the work force. Whilst she was with us, she was training to join the Defence force. She missed out on the first intake by failing one of the tests and I supported her through this until she made it again the second time round. I was also one of her referees for her application and she had a baby and asked me to be her Godmother, and I happily agreed. 

Fast forward to the Defence force graduation - we travelled to celebrate with her and felt ignored. Prior to us coming down she invited our friend group to join her in a grad dinner - but then told us that we could no longer go as only partners were allowed. We found out later from another graduate that actually, anyone could go. She did invite us over to have a few drinks at their accomm the day afterwards but that night ended with one of her uncles nearly having a fist fight with one of our friends so we left. 

We hardly talk now. She's very outgoing on social media, constantly posting training sessions at her gym and work and regular hangs with her new work friends and gym friends. On the occasions we have met up, it's great like old times. But it's always me that organises it and she's often too busy to come or pulls out last minute. The last time we tried she sent us her roster to try find a day.

So I had no car, luckily I was able to get to and from work and school with the help of my gf, but I was saving for a new car. My gf's brother works at an auto shop. One day, a car came in and the owner just decided to sell it to the shop rather than fix it. My gf' brother told me about the car and said that his bosses were willing to sell it to him for $1,500. I thought it was a great idea because it was cheap for a great car, and whatever issues that caused the car to come in were just fixed, so I was sold. I called my mom to tell her the great and she says to not buy the car because my stepdad just bought a car in great condition from his coworke and he's going to do a thorough run through and see if the car is okay and then they'll bring it to me. At this point, I'm feeling grateful because it's a free car. I trusted my stepdad because he was a mechanic for 23 years. When they arrived I was at work, so they just had to leave it in the parking lot for me. I noticed some rust spots on the hood but didn't care. However, when I went to unlock the car, it shrieked 
when it locks/unlocks. I immediately noticed the smell of gas and was worried so I called my stepdad, he told me that it would go away. Only 2 weeks after getting the car, the car overheated to the point of smoking. My gfs brother was able to come and help me cool down the car and found out that I had a cracked radiator and a faulty fuel pump, so I called my stepdad to tell him what had happened and he says ""I'll come fix it because it'll be cheaper if I just buy the parts."" I made an agreement that I would pay them back whatever money used to repair the car, after the repairs the total was about $4,000 that they had paid out of pocket, so I thought. 

Last week, I recieved my in depth credit report and I saw that 2 credit cards had been taken out in my name. One of them i took out, use it for gas and groceries. The other one had a 4,000 spent. The company said that the credit card was taken out via online in September. Him and my mom took a credit card out in my name and made it seem like they had paid. I paid them back $2,000 already and none of it has been used to pay off the card.I called my parents and confronted them and demanded that they pay me back the money that I gave them so that I could pay off debt. They made a huge rant about me being ungrateful. I told my mom that I didn't want to see or speak to her unless it was about paying me back, they've been at my grandparents all week and my mom has made attempts to get me to come over, but when I ask about the money, she tells me to ""not do this right now it's the holidays.""

My mom was upset he wouldn't come over because he didn't want to upset me. He also has 2 daughters he doesn't talk to and won't admit why. (My idea is it has to do with his multiple assault charges) You can't even go to restaraunt with him without him screaming at some teenage girl.
My brother told me Matt was moving in 2 days before my birthday. I begged her not to move him in cause I couldn't handle living with him. He didn't want to make me uncomfortable so he moved in the 3rd time I met him. 
I'm going to be honest, I haven't been the best kid but I am trying so hard. I got multiple concussions when I was little that makes it so my brain has no anger control. Honestly my parents weren't much help. They responded to my tantrums with violence which made it really hard for me to learn its not ok, which resulted in physical fights with my mom for years. Were doing better now (except Matt)
My grandpa (dad's dad) died Oct. 27th. 4 days later her boyfriend let my dogs run away then picked them up by the skin on their neck and I freaked out. I was already really upset and him treating my dogs like that when it was his fault sent me over the edge. The only thing thats been there for me have been my dogs and I'll be dead before I let someone treat them like that. I screamed at him to leave and no one wanted him to move in. We argued and he called me entitled and told me my mom hates me. I told him his own kids and parents don't even love him and he squared up to me with some sort of tool in his hand. I wasn't scared because if he touched me it's over and he's going to jail. My mom got between us and yelled at me to leave. She sent her already mentally disturbed 16 year old daughter to drive in the dark rain while crying because she would rather be with him.
I was allowed back to my house because I had school. He was still there and I lost it. I keep having dreams he's going to kill me. She doesn't care because ""he would never"". He left for a hotel since I was going literally insane.
My mom hates me now. I feel bad that I'm damaging her relationship but I live here also. She hasn't told me she loves me in 2 weeks. She told me she's scared to be alone when me and my brother are going to be gone, so she'd rather spend the rest of the time with a man niether of us want to be around.
Last night he moved to another state. She told my brother as soon as he gets back they're getting married. He has many failed marriages, he has proven he can't be loyal, he is ready to beat her daughter with some tool.
I hate that I'm the reason she's not happy, but they could've kept dating and not move him in.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4821359,public,top,self,AITA for ruining my moms relationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3pgz9/aita_for_ruining_my_moms_relationship/,all_ads,6,,,
