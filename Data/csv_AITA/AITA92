So at one point I text my mom that I made a stop, and that I was fine, I even tried calling her but she doesn’t pick up. She texts me back to use my phone as my GPS. At this point my phone decides to die. I also realize I have no charger cord in my car, which is very unusual. So I make another stop at a store to get a charger cord. Plug my phone in and get it powered up. Put in directions for home and realize there’s simply no way I’m going to make it home by 6pm. But my mom could see my location the entire time.

 Election day when I sent a group message to My Ex (know hereafter as Ex) and our former housemates saying ""vote today if you haven't! there's a lot on the line and if you dont vote then you just like to complain. Have a great day!!""

Ex responded saying ""My first complaint..."" and mentions her mail-in ballot was at our old place and didnt want to go back and get it. 

We live in California and it's super easy to vote here, you can be homeless and vote technically.

I was in the same predicament with my ballot but I went in to my closest polling place and asked for same day reg. it took me a few minutes to fill out the form and vote.

After I voted, I saw Ex's reply I said something like "" they have same day reg. it all took me about 10 mins to register and vote""

Ex responded saying she didn't have the time or energy for that and good for me for voting but she isn't going to this time.

Being cheeky I just replied saying that I voted for the women's rights thing so they were covered.

Ex replied saying it felt like I was guilt tripping her and has been distant since. 

We dated for 2 years and remained close friends after. We hang out fairly regularly but sometimes we get on each other's nerves. She says that I act like im superior to her sometimes and it bugs her. She said something similarly after a couple weeks of distance texting me that the comments about the election upset her, that it felt like I had a lack of understanding and I had a holier than thou vibe so she been keeping a distance.

I responded apologizing saying that I'm still working on my blind spots and that I'm not intentionally trying to seem holier than thou in any way. I appreciate her letting me know what was bothering her so I can be more aware of what I need to work on specifically. I haven't heard too much from her since. 

To me, it feels like because we dated for 2 years, things I say maybe affect her differently than if someone else made a similar comment.

This was all initially in text exchange in a group chat, expect for her reply weeks later saying she was upset. I was not telling her specifically to go vote. Another person in the chat sent a selfie of himself with an I voted sticker on his hat and his dog going to the beach.

I had been going to therapy for 8 years, since before I met Ex to work on myself. I've made a lot of progress and have the tools I need to work through most anything, but I'll be the first to admit that I have blind spots and its helpful when someone calls them out so I can own them and address them.

I'm willing to admit I was an asshole and probably didnt need to make that cheeky joke, but what say you?

Throwaway account.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. He has an older sister who is engaged, and two younger siblings who are still in high school (no SO's).

This Saturday my BF has distant family coming down for Thanksgiving. My BF doesn't talk to this side of the family much, and they never contact him. His sister is a lot more close with them.

 They will be having a party at my BF's parents house.  Everyone I mentioned above is going, including his parents, and my BF's grandma (F70). 

Originally I wasn't going to go, but my BF heard that his sister's fiance was going, and therefore asked my grandma if I could go. 95% of the time it isn't a problem, but his grandma said no this time. She said it was because my BF would only talk to me if I went and she wants him to be more involved with the family conversation. She said I am a distraction.

My BF told me the news and I was honestly a little peeved. We have been together for 4 years and plan to get engaged later next year, so it's not like I'm just some random chick.

I am usually am always invited to events, and feel that it is a bit unfair that his sister's fiance can go but I cannot. I understand the distraction part, but then to me it means no significant others should go.

I expressed this to my bf and he brushed it off, saying it's out of his hands. 

 I've been kind of short with him all night. he finally snapped at me and said I was being ridiculous and that he can't control what his grandma decides. 

I am now wondering if I'm being petty about all of this .

I don't really think i'm the asshole.

I (m22) have two roommates, Jia (f21) and Stacy (f23) Jia started living with us this year and Stacy will be moving out at the start of next year.

They don't get along at all. Stacy is always making rude comments about everything Jia does and calling her names, makes fun of her accent (which you can barely notice tbh) her job, the things she likes, she even talks bad about Jia's star sign, it's tiring. Jia just ignores her but they can't stand each other.

Currently Stacy is the only one that has a car as Jia's broke down in an accident recently and i can't afford one, Stacy doesn't really use hers but she allows me to use it as long as i text her first, i try not to use it unless necessary as i don't want to owe her anything.  Jia can't use it, i doubt she would anyway.

To the problem, recently Jia got sick which has caused enough troubles and rude comments from Stacy already.
A few days ago Stacy was at work (a few blocks away from our place) when i had to take Jia to the hospital, i texted Stacy letting her know that i was using her car.

Well, when she came home later and found out that i took Jia in it she was raging. She started calling me names and talking bad about Jia and was literally screaming about how i know she hates her and is not allowed in her car, then started saying how she probably contaminated the car ??? Althought nothing happened to it.

I understand that it is her car and her rules but it was an emergency, calling an uber or something would have taken time and i told her i was using it but then again, it's her car.

There’s a few regulars that come in and we often discuss a variety of different topics. Another person at the gym let’s call him Amjad (46) brought up how some people in the gym are boycotting the World Cup due to the LGBT rights violations. I said people should boycott and he disagreed. 

He argued that Qatar is it’s own country and has the right to follow its own religion. I expressed that not everyone is Qatar is Muslim so enforcing Islamic laws on everyone isn’t fair. Amjad replies it’s about morality and then says let’s say for example “do you think pedophillia is okay?” And swiftly follows up with “ Or if a middle aged man wants to sleep with his 19 year old daughter is that okay because they’re both consenting adults”. Im livid and disgusted at this point I reply “equating homosexuality to incest or pedophillia is extremely homophobic and bigoted”. Amjad leaves to go use the pool.

There was three of us in the sauna before that point, let’s call the third guy Hassan (30).  Hassan tells me that it wasn’t fair to call Amjad bigoted.

Another regular let call her Vicky walks in (35). We fill her in and she agrees that calling people bigoted is wrong as it’s an insult. I then ask her if someone calls me a racist slur and I call them racist am I now also wrong. Vicky says yes two wrongs don’t make a right. I ask her what I should do and she says rise above it. I tell her if Rosa parks, Martin Luther king or Marsha P Johnson decided to silently rise above racism and homophobia we wouldn’t have made any progress. Vicky then claims equality isn’t progress. We continue to debate back and forth on the same topic 

Amjad and a couple of older brown men walk in and I’m very aware that I’m outnumbered.

I tell Vicky she’s arguing for racists to be allowed to play the victim and silencing people of colour. I said she’s inadvertently supporting white supremacy because the only way to make progress against bigotry is to call it out. Vicky begins to cry.

 I f21, my sister f21 and two other girls f22 Anastasia  and f20 Drizella are currently renting an apartment together in a EU country from the period of October until February. We are not from the country so it was kind of an agreement that we would stay together. My sister and I share a room while they share the other one.

Since we arrived, they refused to follow any house rules. I was okay with it as long as they didn't say anything. This was not the case. For example, when Drizella took a shower she didn't remove her hair from the floor drain. So I asked her kindly to remove it. she didn't say anything and did as asked, which I thought was good, for now.  

They throw unnecessarily rude comments towards me and my sister: They make fun of how we laugh, how we treat eachother nicely, our food taste.etc. They also keep calling us unreasonable for asking for basic hygiene. Anastasia insisted that we share our groceries. Okay, However, she ate mine and my sister's food portions without compensating us. To the point that one time we woke up to find no food for us for breakfast, and she wasn't even sorry.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when a nice lady sent me and my sister some food.  When Anastasia saw the food, I offered if she wanted some and she said she will keep her portion for later.The food needed to be baked.She started to lecture me about how I should bake it and insisted that I bake it her way multiple times, I didn’t do that. After I baked it she told me that it needed more time, I told her I was fine with it and that I am afraid I will get burned from the very small oven. She asked me to step aside and adjusted the tray in the oven then looked at me mockingly and left.Rude. I cut a portion for her and Drizella and kept in a sealed plate in the fridge. I told her that I cut a portion for her and Drizella. She told me ""of course it is unsealed"". Rude. I told her no I covered it. She opened the fridge, looked at the plate, and then started looking for the tray. I told her it was in the oven. She took it, opened it, and then looked me in the eyes and asked me ""Why is our portions smaller than yours?"". I told her I don't understand. She then asked me ""Why didn't you divide the tray into 4 equal portions and did with you portion whatever you pleased?"" That was it.

After my sister and I had enough, we left our 30 day notice.Consequently, Anastasia and Drizella would be expected to pay the full rent. They are arguing with the landlady that they have the right to keep our part of the security deposit. They are saying that we broke the contract although they did not read the contract well, and If they read it well maybe they wouldn't have treated us this way. So, WIBTA if I leave with my sister?

Whilst there are many benefits to showering with a significant other, we both are not avid talkers in the early morning so we just freshen up, shower, make tea and go to our backyard to watch the sunrise. After our routine, we become avid talkers, therefore, elated. 

Until, a couple of days ago, when we had our shower together and he joined at the mid way point (even though he had a shower before me). He began to dry himself off… in the shower?

I told him to get out and dry off like a sane human being, he proceeded to think what he did made sense and told me he doesn’t want to.

Thanksgiving day everyone was running around cooking, getting last-minute ingredients, and/or picking people up to bring them to the house. My partner's brother, let's call him Jason, calls and says he's not feeling well and asks if he should still come. My partner prematurely said, ""Yes"" but did not check with everyone else. Once I found out about the situation I was upset because I think it's incredibly rude to show up to any social gathering if you're sick, with Covid or anything else. I voiced my opinion that I was uncomfortable with Jason coming to a dinner gathering if he was sick, especially in the presence of others who are elderly. My partner called Jason back an hour or so later to say that he misspoke and someone is uncomfortable with it. He said he was gonna discuss things further and call Jason back soon. 

There were so many things going on that day and the family wasn't prepared to get everyone together to get their opinions, most said they were okay with it, one other person said they were not OK with it to me but didn't want to publicly it for fear of causing drama. A few didn't know what was going on because they were out and unreachable. So it ended up being just me who pretty much stood firm and said no to Jason coming because he was sick. Eventually about 2+ish hours later, my partner calls Jason and pretty much says that not everyone in comfortable with him coming if he's sick. The brother was extremely upset also because it took so long and he could have made other plans that night. 

This caused a lot of drama and led to my partner's brother feeling like was ""done dirty"" by being uninvited to Thanksgiving. My perspective is 1. you should not be gathering socially if you're sick, it's disrespectful, 2. don't ask a question if you're not willing to accept both outcomes equally without drama, and 3. you should not transfer the burden of decision-making to several+ other people and instead make the executive decision on what to do with your body. 

This will have adverse effects on future gatherings now because Jason's mother got wind of the decision and felt like her child was treated unfairly and decided not to come and ALSO vowed to ""never spend another holiday with that side of the family again."" My partner ended up having to drive to his mother's house and bring everything she cooked back to the house because she dramatically refused to go to the dinner. 

I can't help but feel like a jerk and like I somehow fractured the family dynamic.

I used to be a hobby photographer for a while and have recently started my own freelance business, although I'm still setting it up.

I used to occasionally take photos for him; street performances, album covers, music videos etc. Also a bit of graphic design and giving him permission to use some of my work for some minor things. Never asked for anything in return.

Next up is the first gig of his new band. Months ago he casually brought it up through voice chat on a Discord conversation. He had the idea that maybe I could take photos of them during the gig. I don't remember my exact response, but most likely something in the line of ""Yeah I could do that"". 

After this, I never heard from it again photography wise, other than maybe a few casual Discord conversations or just small mentions of this gig and when it will be. These voice-chat conversations were mostly together with another friend. He never asked me personally and we certainly never made any agreements or arrangements, other than the ""yeah I could do that"" months ago through the casual convo, if you could call that an agreement. The only ever 'personal' mention about this was a generic text message inviting me for the gig, in a way that seemed to have been sent out to a bunch of other people too. I was busy that day and didn't look through my texts, and honestly forgot about it.

This gig is now coming up on sunday and today he casually asked me through text ""you're gonna be there, right? I told him my work had planned me in for the whole Black Friday weekend so I couldn't be there unfortunately.

He responded with calling it a dick move by not putting it in my agenda or asking my work for a day off, which I could have done, but didn't do. He's now mad that on such short-notice I won't be there taking photos of the gig. 

I feel terrible as we have talked about it very casually a while ago and I won't be there for his first gig, even as a friend, but on the other hand I do feel a bit like I'm getting used. I honestly didn't think too much about it and the date just kinda slipped past me as I didn't put it in my agenda, but we just never made any clear agreements. I've done a lot for him over the years and never asked for anything in return, other than calling him to ask if he could perhaps bring me to the hospital when I got into a minor accident and wasn't able to get there myself, which he did do. He's making it feel like we made very clear agreements and that I was absolutely going to take pictures and had it all planned out. Like I was just absolutely obliged to do it. That wasn't the case.

Now I'm here just thinking ""be glad that I agreed to help you out in the first place with photography and graphic design for absolutely free over these years"".

I (27F) have done social work before, at school, at my mom's church (when she needs a hand Im not really religious, at college, ect. I think is one way to give back to the community and help people, but at the same time I'm generally uncomfortable having to interact with a lot of people, and I try to do my best when I'm being asked to, I always want to leave a good impression on people. It's justed exhausting... It's hard for me to be social and extroverted. That's why I left my customer service job when I had the chance and landed one where I barely have to talk to people. 

My now ex-husband (29M) said that I was a selfish princess for not wanting to spend more free time in a dangerous neighborhood helping people (teaching English, bringing donations that are collected by the group, ect). We're not American, and while I consider myself to be a good teacher specially with kids, is just not comfortable for me to dedicate my weekend to that. Is not my passion. 

I don't like to pity people, and I don't like when people are trying to get that pity from me playing the victim. Some parents use the kids to demand things (and I say demand because they won't accept food sometimes, just money or specific clothes and shoes...). The kids overall are nice, but have a hard time respecting physical boundaries (I mean they are kids after all, I get it), but it does make me uncomfortable. I don't want to be rude to them or say something that might be missinterpreted by the parents and then get me in trouble.

So I'm being called an AH by the group for not wanting to go that often to help. Like I'm ""obligated"" to help and that I feel is unfair. I'm not against social work by all means but I don't want to engage in social work if I'm uncomfortable.

My baby daddy (27m) is spoiled and sheltered, to be blunt. He has a wealthy background and is a bit out of touch in some things and gets frustrated easily when things go wrong. Anyways, our baby is only (7 months/boy), and we decided to just be adults and move in together, instead of him living in a 1br apartment alone and I’m with my mom in a tiny apartment in a dicey area.

So we moved in 2 weeks ago, and my baby daddy (let’s shorten to BD) and I on our 1st night here got bored and walked around as my mom watched our baby, and a car drove by and a guy yelled “yo your b**** got a fat butt” and mind you, we live in 1 of the top 2 most populated cities in USA, so strangers shouting random stuff at us isn’t irregular. We just ignored it and went back upstairs. Then a few days later he allegedly recognized the car and voice that catcalled me in our building’s garage.. Mind you, I don’t think it’s the same guy

Anyways, turns out the guy from the garage and ALLEGEDLY the catcaller is our neighbor, and he confronted him when he saw him in our floors hallway. They got in a screaming match and the neighbor denied it was him, and I honestly don’t think it was him, and in the very small chance it is, I DONT CARE. Then the neighbor’s roommate joined in. BD accused them of being in a relationship, which made them angrier. So then I spoke up by screeching loudly, which made them stop, then I called my BD a drama queen and demanded he get back inside before somebody calls the police. He then pushed the neighbor, and neighbor tried to hit him back but his roommate held him back and BD ran.

This happened 2 days ago. He hasn’t really spoken to me much and I think he’s purposefully making the apartment dirty because whenever I went over to his, it was spotless, and now he leaves clothes and dishes everywhere. I asked him why he’s doing this, he claims it isn’t because of the situation and he’s instead angry that his parents spent thanksgiving out of the country and he didn’t get a blatant invite to his uncle’s thanksgiving (even though his parents told him that he is welcome to go there but he didn’t because his cousins didn’t reach out to say they wanted him there..

TLDR: Baby daddy and I’s son is 7 months. Wasn’t planned but we adapted quickly. Just moved in together. Random guy drives by us 1st day in the area and catcalls me. BD (short for baby daddy) is obsessed with the idea that our neighbor is the catcaller, though I doubt it. BD confronts neighbor, he denies it was him, neighbor’s roommate joins in. BD accuses them of dating. I then screech and call him a “drama queen”. He pushes neighbor, neighbor’s friend holds him back, BD runs away. Since then, BD has been living messy and is hardly talking.

I normally go all out on his birthday and have been buying him expensive gifts since four years. This year, he and his roommate decided that they wanted to a joint birthday party since their birthdays are both in November and they didn’t want ti throw two parties week after week. My boyfriend also had already asked a list of things he wanted me to buy as a birthday gift for him, mostly shoes and clothes which we would go to the mall and pick out later.
So basically I hadn’t planned a party or bought any gift for him. I have been down with flu this week but I did somehow manage to buy him a cake. We live together with three of his guy friends. One of his friend was out, and the other two were sleeping. He called all 3 of them for dinner(unaware of the cake) but they didn’t either pickup or were busy with something else. I texted one of them if he is up to cut the cake but didn’t get a response.As soon as midnight striked, I lighted the candles and sang him a birthday song. He cut the cake and didn’t even take a bite.
Today is the day of the birthday and I asked about the party. He said his roommate doesn’t want to do a joint party now. I was like its okay, we can still do it but we need to get the food and drinks and invite everyone. He seeemed unsure and expressed maybe we should cancel the party. Then, I was like thats fine too, we can go to a nice restaurant, it would be my treat. I just need to know if his friends are going so I can make a reservation. He doesn’t respond and I say or just the two of us can go. Let me know what you want. He doesn’t respond and I ask again and again. He flips out and yells at me that I’m being annoying and to leave him alone. He then goes on watching reels at his phone for about an hour.
Of course, I’m being pretty pissed. His friends made no effort to do anything and I’m trying to single-handedly do what he wants but still its not good for me. About an hour later, he started bugging me to go out to eat(just fast food) and I said I wasn’t hungry and he said then pay for me cuz I’m hungry. So I gave him a 20 dollar bill. He got mad and left without money and said that I turned his mood off on his birthday by being mad.
He went to eat by himself on his birthday and now I’m thinking, AITA ? Maybe I should’ve just gone with him instead of being angry. I would have been really sad if I had to go eat by myself if it was my birthday.
P.S. My boyfriend and I normally buy cakes for other roommates’ birthday or graduation or any kind of celebration.

She somehow blamed the situation on me and became very nasty to me. She told my bf she thinks I'm not good enough for him and shes disappointed in him for being with me. 

She told me I contribute nothing to the house. I was paid by a company to take care of her so I stayed home full time to do whatever she needed.

We decided it was time to move out and started putting money together and asked 2 of our friends to move in with us. She then called my job and told them I wasnt working for weeks (which wasnt true) so they wouldnt give me my last 2 paychecks.

Commercial real estate development company. 

I have a coworker with 8 years total experience. Young woman.

We were both in the accounting department for the first 3 years together. We were cordial and friendly then. We both got promoted into the “deal making” side of it. The company didn’t really give us a lot of training, but she got more deals than me. Fair and square.

Fast forward, she is still in sales, and I took a lateral move to be the accounting manager. Her job is probably better overall, so she has nothing to be jealous of. Mine certainly has way, way more grunt work, but also more feeling of security.

Long story short, this coworker has really been irritating me

- Whenever we interact in a group, she has many “and to add to what OP said” type comments. It feels undermining. 

- When I led a job interview recently, she was the co interviewer. I felt like she kept talking too much, and took it to explain what the accounting coordinators job is to do. I felt this was inappropriate.

- this is the bad one. I “own” the relationship with one of our lenders. I invited her to join the call, because it slightly pertains to her. She completely ranted on and on, and literally got our banks mixed up. She was insulting Bank X to themselves, because the thought we were on a call with Bank Y. She realized her mistake after, but kind of made it a “whoopsie” thing, instead of genuinely being apologetic

- she offers plenty of “suggestions” but won’t roll up her sleeves

This coworker does not make me feel respected at all in my role. She didn’t used to be like this at all, but her personality has totally changed.

For what it’s worth, I don’t think she’s trying to get ahead. I think it’s something where her own sales funnel is a bit dry, and she’s trying to show off her knowledge and contribute. Also, she is a woman in a male dominated field, and I think she’s trying really hard to fit in.

I think it’s harmless enough, and she’s not doing it intentionally. I don’t think any of my coworkers would think less of me because of it

But I fell like after the comments she’s made to me recently pushed me to quit. 

Anyways back to the story, so about 2 months ago my grandfather unfortunately passed away. I followed all my company’s protocols for requesting the time off and I kept my managers informed as best I could with the funeral plans, because I don’t live close to home due to my work. Once the dates were confirmed I let them know and put it on my availability form. 

By accident I had got scheduled for the date I was going to be travelling home. Before going to ask my managers about it I checked my availability just incase it was my fault and I got the dates wrong. My assistant manager was behind me and asked if my time off was put through as a holiday request, I clarified that it was sorted between me and the managers and she didn’t need to worried about it. She responded with a sarcastic comment along the lines of “oh is it now”. Here’s where I might be the asshole. I was a little emotional so I wiped around and said “it’s a I need to go home for a funeral request, still wanna question it?” And her response was “yes a little bit” this is what made me loose all respect for her. 

I walked away because I was in shock if I’m honest. I did tried to push it away and act like it didn’t bother me but she the day before I left she made yet another comment about my availability at work. To clarify I am at work every day they are open and the only time off I’ve had is for health reasons prescribed by a doctor or covid. But I went full greys anatomy and responded with “I’m so sorry that the death of my family member is so inconvenient to you.” She then went on to back peddle and claim she was talking about the staff as a whole and I just walked away. 

Ever since then every petty/ bitchy comment she’s made towards me has made me feel more aggravated and got to me more then they normally do. It finally got to the point that I left my shift early and brings me to the second reason I might be the asshole. I ended up messaging one of my managers a lengthy paragraph with every other word being fuck, shit, or bullshit signing it off with I’m not coming in tomorrow, good luck tomorrow because you’re gonna need it. His response was as professional as I’ve ever seen/heard him be, but he tried to act oblivious. I followed on with “this is the straw that broke the camels back, I’m done you can take this as my letter of resignation.” 

I feel bad, not for the managers but for the team that I know is going to struggle and my work bestie who’s going to have to pick up all the work that I do.

This is the first year my bf and I have been together during the holidays (no we are not that young). Long story short he is a very nice guy, family oriented, kind to others and thoughtful (yes this is becoming a compliment sandwich). So this year I hosted Thanksgiving for the first time. My family and extended family came down for the day and my bf made the trek 45 min one way to be here for just an hour (which I wholly acknowledge and truly appreciate it). We had agreed he would meet up with my family today to watch an NBA team play at a sports bar (his favorite team and I place I know he would love). He ended up canceling this morning because he felt a migraine coming on. So the conundrum…he’s canceling on us tonight after going out to a sports bar this afternoon to meet up with his friends to watch a different game which I was in full support of. I tried to be understanding and extended an invite for him to join us tomorrow with the family before they head home. We won’t see them again until next Christmas as they live a few days drive away. He said no because he’s going to stay home and spend time at his local bar with his other friends he hasn’t seen in a while (they all met for a drink 2 days ago before thanksgiving…) AITA for being disappointed he’s bailing? If he truly didn’t feel well this morning does it really make sense you can meet up with your friends but can’t power through a few hours later with your gf and her family? I was so excited for him to spend time with my siblings and to get what feels like an excuse is disappointing and makes me question our future.

I also have BPD and several other mental health conditions due to childhood trauma. 

So today I was getting a bus home with one of my other autistic friends, we're both 17 and attend college together. We sat at the back, and so we had to speak loudly to hear eachother over the engine in the bus. I was most likely speaking too loud, I will fully admit to this, as I'm really not great at volume control and have a tendency to speak louder than socially acceptable, as does my friend. However, there were two lads in front of us, whispering and being rude the whole time. 

Right before they got off, one of them turned to us and said ""I'm not being funny, but you're sat right next to eachother and you're still yelling"", I didn't say anything and my friend just apologised. That would've been it, but when they got off, the one dude that turned around whispered fucking hell and a flip just switched in my brain. 

I started to raise my voice and said ""oh go fuck yourself, if you've got a problem with me then start a f*ing problem"" (I know it doesn't make much sense but I was seeing red lmao) at which point my friend calmed me down because my god was I angry. Nothing more happened, just a bit of a scene was caused that settled down fairly quickly. 

I know I shouldn't have raised my voice, and should have been quieter in the first place, but is it a lot to ask that they could've just asked us to be quieter when they were first bothered? Instead they decided to cause a scene, make me and my friend both feel bad for speaking louder than we realised we were, and caused me to get upset and angry. I know I'm an asshole here and should've handled this very differently, but I feel like they handled this very poorly too. 

I was bullied in school for years by people like this for being too loud, and I ended up selectively mute for a while and stopped trying to socialise with people, which is why this bothered me so much. I'm also very protective of my friends, and don't usually get angry if it's just me that someone has an iusse with. Anyway, AITA? Is ETA? What are your opinions on the whole situation?

I (F20), was about to dine with DIL, MIL, bf, but then a fight start, MIL started it: first because the room wasn't enough tidy, then it went on 'cause there were students some days ago, under the rain and none of them was wearing a jacket or something, ""it's winter, it's cold outside, why didn't they wear something, what's wrong with kids; then because of their hairstyle, all with this ugly hair in the face, ecc... she started yelling at my bf: his hair. He don't like having it short, dil and mil like them short. ""It's my son I decide how he must be"", ""what will people think"". Then started calling him ugly names. Not the first time. It's always something, there's always a reason for thinking she can insult him or his brother. No. You can't. I mean, yeah you can, but you shouldn't be someone who judges so bad and in negative way his children.  
First of all, my bf has really normal hair, nothing crazy, no reason at all to not like it except for personal taste. I'm not saying because his my bf, but seriously, it's really ok.
Well, I was really nervous, I started to shake, my heartbeat went up crazy and I really felt and knew that I should stay quite: I said that she can say it to him without calling him names and shouting, he doesn't have that much self-esteem, if even your mother starts telling you look crazy and like a caveman or a monster, then well, you know. (For info, she always use those words or worst for things she doesn't approve). stop yelling, it's not helping anyone. I went almost nc with my mom for things a little more messed up that this, but you can really lose your child if you keep behaving like that. It's not one time, it's for all the times that that happen. She said that she already told him in a calm way and he didn't listen, all while shouting to me (when I point out that I'm not mad and I'm not yelling she said that I came all nervous and starting attacking her - almost true, except for the part where I was not attacking, just asking). I said to her that she also didn't listen to her mother (her words), when she was younger and behave like shit (again, her words, we were all sitting together, with the grandma, mil and mil's sister). She said that this is not true, and all things her mother told her, she was mad at the time but then understood them. Well, I know that her mother never said nor behave like her when she was younger.
It went on like that, I couldn't eat, I started crying because I can't understand how she is, and seems, to be someone so gentle, a good heart, someone you can be friends, and then start to act like that. She couldn't stop yelling and listen just for a moment. I wasn't against her, I wasn't saying that my bf behave right, I wasn't saying anything but to please stop yelling.
I know that I was wrong, I just hate that there's always a reason to start yelling at her sons and calling them names. All I wanted to do was protecting my boyfriend.

His reasoning is because “it’s not the same with me there” which just hurts my feelings and I feel is a mean thing to say. Im pretty shy, so I’m working on getting more comfortable around them which I have been, but it’s hard when I never get the opportunity to spend time with them. I come from a pretty broken home so I feel like I don’t have the loving, all together family dynamic that he has, and this is why me wanting to spend more time around them is even more important to me. It happens a lot when he will tell me “oh im doing this with my family this weekend “ and I always hope he will invite me but he hardly ever does. I get upset at him about never inviting me but he will then call me selfish for trying to make it about me, and then tell me it’s pathetic when I try to invite myself. It just turns into a huge fight every time and it gets turned completely to me being selfish. And I understand alone time with his family is important too- it’s not that, it’s just because it’s like that ALL the time. Our relationship is serious, we talk about getting married, kids, our future A LOT. I just don’t understand after all this time of being together why he still makes excuses to keep me out.

In 1912 I was on the titanic going to New York. It was 12 AM at when I heard a loud crashing and it woke me up. My husband didn't. We were in bunk beds and water was filling the room. I tried to find my clothes but couldn't find them. I ran out and I was only in underwear and a bra and high heals! everyone could see my fat body. The hallways were crowded. I was about to get on a boat when I realized I left my husband. We were on the very bottom, and my husband was trapped by the water. I went back to save him and I grabbed a wind-blower to blow the water out the way and was using the pipes on the ceiling to get to the room. The water came all the way up to my neck. The water was **EXTREMELY** cold! I yelled down the hallway ""don't worry husband! I'll save you!"" I opened the door and my husband was laying on the bed crying cause he thought he was going to die I told him to ""come on!""

 We had to use the pipes on the ceiling to move. Again, I was only in underwear, a bra and high heels. And we were in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. There were 3 floors and we got up to the doc and ALL the boats were gone! At that moment the ship split in 2 and it when into the water. People were screaming, splashing water, and just complete chaos. That day, 1500 people went into the sea when titanic sank.

There were 19 boats nearby, and only one came back, ONE. 8 people were saved including myself. My husband unfortunately didn't make it. He froze to death. I should have left him in the room so I could get a lifeboat so I live, he dies.

Recently, D's partner (let's call them E) reached out to me regarding D's negative behaviour. They needed someone who had seen this side of D, and ofc that's me. E asked about various things to do with D and revealed that D had been doing some suspicious things, such as lending Es clothes and jewelry that E had bought for D to another member of the group, as well as ignoring E and playing the victim when confronted about these things.

I simply told them that I would have cut them off at this point and that even if you ask, D will most likely not change and not help, but that it's up to E what they choose to do. That whole group and I had been going to conventions together for a long time, E joining us when they got together with D, but E had said that all the times they went with D, it was not fun and D had ruined it somehow, so I offered for E to join my current group for the next convention.

I understand that E is still D's partner, they all still go to the same conventions as me and we had left each other on a bad note, this could look suspicious. D may think that I have taken E as some kind of 'revenge' or manipulated E to break up with D somehow, or just wanted to show off. I don't want to cause any more arguments between all of us considering how difficult it was to get over the first one.

Immediately he reacts saying that I’m a “baby” that my ego is “fragile” and that I’m acting immaturely. I told him that I thought his behaviour was high school-ish.

He wasn't feeling the greatest, so I used that and him needing a diaper change or a nap as an excuse when either of these women wanted to hold him. My husband was pissed. But I feel like my reasoning is perfectly acceptable, so I want to know... AITA?

 First SIL is a heavy abuser of pills. Pills of any kind and will take uppers and downers any chance she can get. She was even caught stealing her sick father's morphine and is so high she can barely take care of herself. I was informed last night that she would be attending Thanksgiving because ""she got a refill on her pills"". Knowing that she sleeps through her own daughter, 3y/o getting outside, and that she is barely with it enough to talk every time I've met her, I feel confident in my choice of not letting her hold my son. 

The second SIL I have issues with stemming back from high-school and it may seem petty, but that's why I'm here. Back in high school I was bullied by several ""popular"" girls. I couldn't walk anywhere without being called nasty names or hearing nasty rumors about me. I'd sit in class with these girls spitting spit balls into my hair and once my back pack was stolen, my school books and homework were shredded and my personal journal was taken and shared with who knows how many people. Needless to say, my high school years were traumatic and heartbreaking. This SIL was part of that girl group. Fast forward MANY years, she is married to my husband's brother. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt that she had grown up and we were now adults, and neither of us acknowledged our high school days. As a matter of fact, at the last family gathering, I'd thought that we had hit it off and had some good conversations. I later found out that she was telling my husband's family that I was a bad mother for having a 2 white claws while at the gathering. Her reasoning was that I was breastfeeding, however, I fed my son BEFORE I had any drinks, and did not breastfeed him again until much later that evening. (We had bottles prepared just so I could relax and enjoy myself a bit.) I then heard that she was complaining to the family about how our family is ALWAYS doing something. It was meant to be an attack on us, although it just came across to me as jealousy. In the end, I feel I gave her another chance to redeem herself, and she proved to me that she has not changed much from the 15+ years since we graduated high school. And for that reason, I don't feel that I should have to allow her access to my son either. 

In all honesty, I feel that no matter what my reasons are, I should absolutely be able to choose who I do and not let my children around and whether people like it or not is too bad. But apparently that is not ok with my husband. I was made to feel like complete shit for that choice and he did not have my back during this ordeal and now I feel like trash.

This year we needed to vote  for a new theme for the dances for the next season. The chosen theme was  samba. I didn't vote for it cause I knew the ones who would, would make it really sexy which I am uncomfortable with. I still gave it a chance.

 Despite trying I couldn't really pick up the coreo cause I felt uncomfortable the whole time, which resulted in me receiving a lot of dirty looks. Every week when I got home I just started to cry because I felt so horrible. 
Still I went every week cause this dance group was like a second family to me. 

Then the first part of our costum arrived... we needed to sew the costumes ourselves and got a cheap leotard as a start. It was way to small for me, barely anything was covered. The others didn't see a problem in that so I wasn't allowed to get a new one.

After that I couldn't do it anymore. So I told my old dance teacher who I was now dancing with, that I was out. She called a meeting with all the important people of the group (sorry I don't know how to describe them) to talk about it. They said they knew who was giving me dirty looks and are talking behind my back and they would try to make me more comfortable . I still quit ( a few moth later they sided with them btw)

 One thing that was comforting me tho is that I was still able to dance because I was teaching dance to the kids and teens. Everyone, except the parents, told us (me and a really good friend of mine who was teaching dance with me) everything we did was wrong but when we asked for help they just said we were doing great.

 We were often really close to quitting and let them deal with it but me and my friend really loved to teach the kids so we just kept going. After the first performance of the kids and teens we got a lot of shit from the adult dancers and after that my old dance teacher started to ""help"" us with the training aka saying we do everything is wrong and we are not challenging the kids enough even tho the kids asked to make it a bit easier cause what they were doing before was to hard for them. 

After a month my old dance teacher told me I wasn't an official dance teacher anymore cause I didn't have the experience, which would have bee ok, if they didn't bring on another dancer from the adult to help teach, whk has never taught the kids ever.... After that my decision was clear... I would quite completely. 

I told my friend who was teaching the kids with me first and she implied that I am kind of an Asshole for quitting in the middle of the year. I still did it and when I brought our mascot back, which was stored at my house, one of the parents overheard that I was done teaching and we talked about it. Before I finally left her 4 year old daughter hugged me and told me she would really miss me.

After going through the report once I had to edit almost all the chapters entirely and add an entire chapter of my own because M had not done anything saying ""You know this project better because you came up with the idea so I left it for you to do."" That was BS because I had explained the entire project to them over and over, but with the deadline approaching I just told them to edit a different document, it was something I was supposed to have done a while back but I didn't get around to doing it (same project). They did not respond but replied to a message I sent just after so I assumed they would do it.

20 minutes before the deadline the rest of them starts asking me if I'm done with the report and at the same time asking if I have edited the second document as well. I said that I mentioned earlier that I wouldn't be able to do both things simultaneously so they pick one while I do the rest. They started coming after me saying that they had given me the work much earlier and wouldn't do it (I later found out that they couldn't do it because 3 of them were wasted). I stopped responding to their calls or texts and somehow managed to submit the report and the second doc.

N started calling me about an hour later. As soon as I picked up the call, she asked whether I had submitted it. I implied that I might've submitted the report without any of their names in it because I had done the entire project by myself and that because of their incompetence I had to ask my long-distance girlfriend who, by the way, has her exams going on, to help me in this project. She got irritated and said ""Yes I am incompetent, I haven't done anything in this project. Now tell me have you submitted it without our names."" I said by your admission you have had no contribution to this project, so tell me why I should've put your names in it. Then I straight up lied and said that yes I had submitted the project without their names (Ofc everyone's name was there), N started crying and her roommate snatched the phone from her and started berating me on how she would complain to the Dean, the professors, and seniors about how I had plagiarized the report if N's name was not there and how I was an ass. I had never spoken to the roommate before so I was very polite and kept asking her to keep out of business that did not concern her. She kept on attacking me, calling me names, and threatening me, so I said that if she's not giving the phone back to N, I would not be continuing the conversation any longer, and saying so I disconnected.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4824992,public,top,self,AITA for being cold and lying to a group member,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4quge/aita_for_being_cold_and_lying_to_a_group_member/,all_ads,6,,,,

My laundry in my building requires coins to use, and I was unfortunately out of quarters. Normally I have a big stockpile so this isn’t an issue, but I happened to run out this time. This has happened before. 

Previously I had gone to the laundromat I used to go to down the street from me. They have a coin exchange machine, so if I put in a dollar I get the equivalent in quarters. However the last couple of times the new management got annoyed at me and said the machine was for paying customers only and not to use it.

I definitely disregarded this a couple times when the owner wasn’t there and got change, which wasn’t necessarily right based on what he’d told me, but I also thought 4 quarters wasn’t a big deal.

Fast forward to today and he sees me trying to get quarters. Damn! I’d been caught. Instead of being calm this time though, he swore at me and accused me of being part of a ‘collective of people’ who try to get coins from the machine. He was escalating and I told him to relax. Even though I was wrong, I’m still the customer and don’t deserve to be talked to in such a way, almost as if I was homeless. So I tell him I will give him the quarters back if he wanted. I stood there and he opened the machine and gave me two dollars. I explained to him how I used to do it often under old management and didn’t see it as a big deal then. I asked him, since I still had wet laundry at home, if I could come by and then use it. I don’t think he expected I would come back after this heated exchange, so he said yes of course, because then I’d be a paying customer.

I went home and was offended and bothered by the way this guy talked to me even though I know he had the right to be annoyed. I wrote a bad review on Google for the place and mentioned that he swore at me and was short with me.

I ended up going back with my load of wet laundry and used the machine after all of this. Put my clothes in the dryer as a paying customer this time. The owner comes out and starts reading my bad review to me out loud. I tell him I don’t wanna hear it. He escalates and starts swearing again. This time he says he’s kicking me out. He opens the dryer as it’s going and tells me he’s going to call the police and that he thinks I’m harassing him. I tell him to de-escalate, and it pisses him off more. I ask why he’s calling the police and he mentions the bad review. He says he has my face on camera and if I come back it’s trespassing. I ask him why he’s gonna call the cops over a bad review and he closes the door behind me.

Yesterday at our Thanksgiving dinner, my brother and his wife kept complaining about how terrible the flight is going to be with both of the kids. They kept going on and on, making jokes about getting drunk on the flight or taping the kids' mouths shut.

I got kind of sick of hearing about it and every conversation topic circled back to the vacation flight one way or another. It was a bit petty, I jokingly told them if they hate flying with their kids so much they don't have to go on vacation.

My brother really didn't like that, and accused me of saying that parents don't deserve vacations. He said I don't get it and that I'll understand when I have kids, and told me I'm being disrespectful.

I told them they're being weird and that I was just pointing out that going on vacation isn't a necessity if they really dread flying with their kids so much, considering how much they've been complaining about it.

In 2021 one of them became my bf. At the time I had a serious depression and attempted to commit su1c1d3, which caused me to lose my job and made me go back home. My relationship with my mother is not bad, but she is an extreme simp so we had a lot of discussions bc of it. Several months after the attempt passed and I had problems with her again, and was, once again, depressed. 

My friends usually met up on weekends, when I usually went to see my bf, but I didn't have the energy to cope up with social interactions, so I decided I wouldn't go, and my bf decided to stay with me. They misunderstood this as if I was plotting to take my bf away of them, and started to treat me coldly. My bf and I talked to them and everything seemed fine again. 

But I noticed the same behavior recently from one of my f friends and decided to confront her. She told me she treated me with neutrality, that everything was my imagination, and that she found suspicious that I'm feeling bad again when my bf wants to start going to their meetings.

Today I received a letter from another member of the group telling me they were tired of my jokes and me avoiding paying for food, so they decided to stay away from me.

I'm a person who jokes all the time around friends, and I'm only serious when the situation requires it.

I don’t know, I’m probably over the top but this is what I think. A dog is a loooong commitment and needs a lot of thought. In my opinion surprising people with a puppy as a present makes a cute moment or video, but beyond that it’s not always the best idea. 

Anyways, I gently let Greg know that I love him and his thoughtfulness for me and I appreciate it so much but I want to return the pup for said reasons above. I said I would still like to move forward with visiting a rescue with him in the new year. His feelings are *really* hurt and at first he was quiet about it but now he’s kind of angry and is saying that i’ve been sending mixed messages (saying I want a dog and then not accepting this one) and that i’m being difficult. I feel awful but I’m holding firm.

When I was in university I became friends with a girl who came out and began dating women in Canada. Someone posted a photo of her and her gf at the time kissing and her family found out and disowned her. She didn’t have money and wasn’t allowed to work due to being an international student. She asked me for help and we went online and figured out if we married she would be safe and could work and study as normal. I was young and didn’t really think about my future and just wanted to help a friend so we got a marriage certificate and moved in together. She worked and studied and so did I for 2 more years until we both graduated. We left for different cities for work and formally divorced 3 years later. I consider her a good friend and she helped me a lot with my sister when she was having issues with a landlord (they are in the same city). Of course she is very scared and begged me never to say anything to anyone about our fake marriage because it illegal. 

I only told my fiancé now because we are going to get married next summer and I think he should know but I never told my exs. I thought he would be supportive and understanding about it because he seems to be ok with LGBT issues but he got really mad and said it was a massive issue and now he can’t get it out of his head I might me gay. I told him I’ve never been with a girl and I’m definitely straight and he said I couldn’t be sure and I could leave him for a woman.

My friend, I'll call her K, has been having a pretty shit time since the start of college. she's been through so much. Too having someone close to her being hospitalised and risk death, to being hrassd by this guy at college.

The guy (call him M) is a bit of a pick-me honestly. He talks a lot about how no one likes him and talks down about himself a lot. But oddly he also is the complete opposite, he's very up himself and calls himself really smart and brags about himself. He also makes a lot of dirty uncomfortable jokes.

There's another kid in our class with autism (I think at least) and M made the comment that M was on the 'smart side of autism' and the other kid was on the 'dumb side'. despite not passing English or maths so that's pretty ironic.

After M found out, he kept telling her how he was such a comforting person and how she needed to be comforted, touching her hand and wanting to hug, despite K telling him no because she didn't like physical contact. He then kept telling her she needed to get a bf so she could be comforted even after we told him that she had me, her friends and even her family.

Recently K found out that her ex had been hospitalised and could potentially die. M continued to ask her out and K kept telling him she wasn't interested and still liked her ex, he then said that she shouldn't as he's on his deathbed so should say her goodbyes while she still can. Also telling her that if she cared, she would go see him despite K not being allowed (and other reasons)

It was becoming a bit too much as he even stated that he himself was becoming 'unhealthily obsessed' with K

K was in tears about what he had been saying so I messaged him.

He said he had no clue what I was on about.

I said 'for a supposedly 'comforting person' you're pretty shit at comforting
stop being do obsessed with finding K a boyfriend, she literally likes _ so stop saying he's on his death bed because that shits messed up and so insensitive'

He said sorry and and said he didn't know he was making it worse 

'You know being autistic and stuff I'm pretty shit at that thing'

'Don't try and make friends with the autistic kid if you can handle it when I do something wrong or not socially acceptable'

I honestly didn't know how to handle the situation after this. I told him that I understand that it might be difficult for him and to understand why I'm angry.

he said 'I know she's having a hard time I've been trying to help but everything I do fucks shit up so imma just leave you both alone and hope you forget about me at this rate'

I didn't know what to say.

He has a habit of blocking us when something happens and reacting this way. He tells us to forget about him and makes us feel guilty. AITA?

I know it sounds pathetic and there are much bigger problems in the world and I have bigger problems too it just stings you know? I also found out the four of them have a groupchat without me in it for no particular reason.

 I’ve tried telling them all how I feel but nothing ever changes. C just makes me feel guilty by getting upset and makes it about her, tells me she’s sorry and it won’t happen again but it does. B just gets mad and tells me I’m being ridiculous and the twins barely say anything.

I just don’t think they ever will.

I’m in my final year of sixth form and we’re all going to university so I’m hoping then I will meet new people, but I love my group I’m just heartbroken that i don’t think they feel the same.

My sister came home early from a date with Mike really early, and was upset, so I asked her what was wrong. She told me she and Mike had just broken up. When I asked her why, she simply told me that he was a POS and treated her like garbage. She refused to say more and I was shocked. I knew Mike for years and he never seemed like the type of person to do that. Of course, since she was my twin sister, I called up Mike a bit angry asked him to explain. He was a bit pissed, understandably so now that I know the truth, that I believed my sister and didn't even ask for his side of what happened. He told me that he and Jess never had a date planned for today, and instead he found her with another guy she was seeing. He'd found out recently through a mutual friend that Jess was apparently seeing another for a few weeks and he confronted her that night, in public, and broke up with her. He even sent me screenshots of texts between him and my sister after he left her, where she was basically berating him and asking him to come back. I felt ashamed, apologized, and told him I'd call him back. I then went to my sister's room and confronted her. She denied it, until I showed her the screenshots Mike had sent. She finally broke down, saying she didn't mean to, but she felt like Mike no longer paid her any attention and felt like they were just forcing their relationship. I asked her why she didn't simply break up with him, and she said she wanted to be with him, but also wanted to be in an affectionate relationship. Apparently the guy knew about Mike and agreed to be her side man. I then asked her why decided to lie to me and potentially ruin my friendship with Mike, and she said because I'm her twin brother, and I should be on her side anyway. That's when I told her that she's ""vile and deserves to be alone."" I left after and called Mike, basically apologizing.

Okay so it’s 12 am and 5-6 hours ago I realised the family dog in our parents house was gone.  

So my parents live with my brother(13) in their apartment on the 5th floor and they have this bad habit to open the door when they’re ready to leave and “waiting” even though my brother is still getting ready. This has resulted to the dog going downstairs until the entrance a few times. Also the dog isn’t trained, it was a rescue and has been chipped but he barely knows sit, stay and of course go for a walk.  

Now here’s what happened, I came to see them for the weekend as I live in another city and I arrived very early in the morning so in the afternoon I was already tired and ready to sleep. I was laying on the couch while my dad was going to take my brother and his friend for soccer practice and since the dog hasn’t gone out for a walk and the door was again wide open he slipped out at some point my dad was “waiting” and no one noticed. About an hour later I was kind of asleep and realised he isn’t anywhere close to me and after looking all over the house and called my dad we confirmed he was gone.  

After hours of looking around everyone is grieving in their own way while still hoping we’ll find him. 
I asked them to please not talk to me as I love this dog and needed some space but they insisted and I said well “I am not trying to guilt you or play the blame game but you’re not responsible as a family to own a dog.”  

I know it’s a d**k thing to say but this is the second dog we lose in a very short period of time. First one was hit by a car in 2020 after she got loose from by brother’s hands, because she was strong and bro was a little younger and went right into the highway. He had to go through therapy and the doctor said we should get another dog and we did. I’m pissed and said what I said, because I’ve said many times he needs to be responsible and take him on walks, train him not to run off, not follow strangers, pretty much basic stuff, they always agree with me but brush it off, and to open the door when they leave not have it open for 5-10 minutes while “waiting”.

Recently I was accused of having a ""boomer mind-set"" and I want to know AITA for thinking the way I do? 

Has the world come to the point where only A\*\*holes ***expect*** people to do the job they were hired to do?

**BACKGROUND:** 

In another reddit that discusses a certain package delivery company, I posted a question about a recurring problem with some drivers failing to deliver to my apartment saying I was not home (""undeliverable""). Below is a small extract of the thread where the aforementioned ""boomer mind-set"" accusation was made. The original text is edited to fit into the character limit.

 ===

***DELIVERY DRIVER:***

I'm sorry you receive poor quality of service, but your complex sounds like a P.I.A. to deliver to. I probably wouldn't either if I was getting paid $125 a day. 

 \---

***""UNDELIVERABLE"" CUSTOMER:***

FIRST: Why would you see it as a pain? It's a typical apartment complex.

SECOND: Even if it was a pain, are you telling me you think it is alright to prevent people from getting their goods delivered because the driver is not paid enough? Man that is a sucky attitude. The old lady in the apartment across from me gets her medications shipped every 90 days but your comment suggests you would be ok about it if she doesn't get them because it is too hard for the driver to make the delivery? Really? If the job is too hard the driver should get a different job, not fail to do what they were hired for.

 \---

***DELIVERY DRIVER:***

It sounds like a place with a lot of stops that doesn't have somewhere central to drop off any packages. Meaning you have to go door to door. Which takes a lot more time to do than dumping it in the mail room and leaving. I'd probably do it since I'm paid hourly but most drivers aren't. If your making $125 a day you're only incentive is to get done asap. If your complex is a impediment to getting done early your packages are probably getting coded or marked ""not on van"".

You sound like you have the boomer worth ethic mind-set, to do your job well no matter the cost. Yeah that doesn't apply to this job. It's functionally a dead end job done with bottom of the barrel contracted labor. This job has no future, few benefits, and crap pay. Most contractors won't even supply hand trucks since it cuts into their bottom line. Not to mention that many contractors are going out of business due to rising fuel prices, labor shortages, and lower payouts from \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Welcome to \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, shit service for cut rate prices.

The customer is the mortal enemy of the \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Driver. Some drivers start off being helpful but quickly become jaded and filled with resentment. Whether the 3rd floor furniture deliveres, the passive aggressive notes, the entitled customers or whatever else. The customer exists to screw us and make our lives harder, the residential \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* customer exists to screw us and nothing else.

Let me explain.

I (22f) live in a very small rented apartment with three other people my age. My friend, Alice (22f) got a boyfriend, Jeremy (20m) around July of this year. The short story is that Jeremy used to live with his dad, but 3 weeks ago, his dad basically threw him out. This resulted in Jeremy asking Alice if he could come live with us, and at first Alice asked me and our other roommates if we were okay with this. I immediately said no because the apartment is very small and the bills in our area are through the roof rn, so with 5 people in here, it was going to be incredibly crowded, and the other roommates were basically on the same opinion as me. (Let me just say that I asked specifically if Jeremy had any other options on where to stay and Alice said that yes, he did have other options, but they ""weren't good for him"".)
Alice said okay at first, but we noticed that Jeremy was coming to have lunch and dinner, and also staying to sleep basically every day. We didn't say anything to Alice at first, but 2 weeks ago she basically got mad at me specifically. I had no idea until Alice's mom texted me asking if we were mad at each other, I said no, but Alice's mom told me that Alice thought that I was mad at her. Honestly, I was none the wiser, and although I was mad for a bit I didn't let it show, but whatever. 
Immediately after this, Alice and Jeremy went to live in Alice's mom's apartment without saying anything to anyone, and Alice basically stopped talking to me completely. I tried talking to her through text, but she never responded. Fast forward to this week, Alice came to the apartment to get some stuff, talked to the other two roommates in front of me, but she didn't even look at me. 
I told my roommates that I found her attitude incredibly childish and that I was not going to try to talk to her anymore, since she has shown to me time and time again that she prefers some dude she has known for 5 months over her supposed ""best friend"".

I (21,M) have recently come out to my parents as gay. Since Korea is a pretty Conservative country, they didn't take it lightly. My mother came around pretty quickly but I still don't talk to my father. This feud we have going on has caused my insomnia which to no surprise is a big step back in terms of university life. 

My mother suggested that I should go to my grandmother's in hopes that why change in environment will do me good. So I packed my bags and caught the bus two days later. Granny welcomed me lovingly and gave me all the space I needed (didn't know of the reason I have come). The same day she introduced me to a boy from the village, let's call him Seok. He worked a lot of jobs around the village, paying off his father's debt. 

He was sporting dark eyebags but still offered me a tour of the village since I haven't been there a long time. We started hanging out and I fell for him before I was even aware of it. I met his sister Yunjin (17) during this time and his childhood bestfriend Yuna (25, F), along with some other peers.

I felt like I belonged for the first time in so long, despite my initial awkward encounters with the folks judging my 'designer clothes' and layer I found out they thought I came there to brag. Seok had been very touchy when it came to money and we even got into an argument because I wanted to pay for our meal out of instinct. 

Between other silly little arguments we had and outings with friends, we kissed for the first time. It was around the time that his cousin Haewon (24,F) came to visit from the city. He was scared, too scared, so we avoided each other for some time. Yuna and Haewon found it weird since we were practically joined at the hip at all times. 

Eventually, he came around and confessed his feeling and I knew he was terrified of being seen so we agreed to keep out interactions to a minimum around others. It worked for some time, until one day a frantic Haewon came crying that Yuna's cousin had seen them and dragged her inside the house.

Seok immediately ran out of the house but I was very confused so I followed after him. I found him beating Yuna's cousin senseless for laying a hand on her. He was also badly hurt but I couldn't intervene for Haewon was still shaking in my arms. 

Later when we got home he told me how Haewon and Yuna are together and sudden everything clicked into place- the knowing looks exchanged and hand holding. The next day, Haewon came over and asked me if I remembered the promise I made to her the day she caught me and Seok.

She has never married or had kids, yet has strong opinions on how to bring up children and has had opinions on how i was brought up and how I raised my 3 sons. My mum felt responsible for her so she was around a lot. We all got used to letting her comments wash over us and roll our eyes. But more recently she seems to have got worse and I seem to be less patient. 

My sons are now in 30s, great guys with great partners, really proud of them, sadly don’t live too near but we meet up when we can. 2 now married, 1 long term cohabiting.

1st (adored) grandchild born “too soon” after son’s wedding according to Aunt (she worked it out!). She said really horrible things, mainly about DIL (really disapproves of sex before marriage and blames woman) but “at least they got married”. I kept most of the comments from them but they were hurtful and I was annoyed. Too ‘respectful’ to say too much to her though. Stupid me. 

2nd son’s partner now pregnant. Me and hubby are thrilled about another grandchild.  They are not planning to get married, which is up to them but I’m now stressing about Aunt’s reaction to this. 

It was recently 3rd son’s wedding. I asked 2nd son and partner not to announce pregnancy before wedding, so Aunt wouldn’t spoil wedding. They agreed but also not to overshadow wedding, even though had they announced it would have been before wedding. I worried throughout- she was starting to show slightly by then and she wasn’t drinking. Would Aunt guess? How ridiculous. 

My son and new DIL are back from honeymoon and we have family party to look at wedding pics. All sons and partners are coming. I’m looking forward to it.  
Except, as per tradition I should invite Mother and Aunt. I’m happy for Mother to come but can’t face Aunt making similar comments, especially in front of pregnant GF. I want her to feel welcome in our house. I don’t want to subject her to these nasty comments. 

I’ve told Mother I’m not inviting Aunt. Mother understands my POV but thinks she will have to decline as well or it will cause a big row. She thinks I’m being unreasonable because she’s always been like this (true), I’ve never uninvited her before (true), I’ve never complained before (tried), my boys know what she’s like (true, sadly) and I shouldn’t punish her for something she hasn’t actually done yet.

I (28F) am getting married in three months and I invited around 15 family members, including my first cousin and her husband. I saw them last weekend and saw that he was prominently carrying a pistol on his hip. I asked why he was carrying a gun to visit my grandmother and he said he got his concealed carry permit and would not be going anywhere without his weapon. I said I would like him to leave it at home or lock it in the hotel safe during the wedding, and he said he would absolutely not do that and that he would be bringing the gun everywhere with him from then on. I started to get upset and said I didn’t want guns at my wedding because it was unnecessary, threatening, would make other guests uncomfortable and generally was a bad idea since we’ll have an open bar. He said I would just have to deal with it and said I was being a “liberal pansy” for making a big deal about it and I said he could be a “conservative asshole” at home that weekend and to not bother coming. He and my cousin left immediately in a rage, and I calmed down a little and spoke to my fiancé, who said it was my decision and that he would support whatever I decided to do. 

Later, my cousin called and I made it clear that they were both still invited if her husband agreed to part with the gun for the three hours of the wedding. She said he was making “a stand for his beliefs,” and that he would not. I said in that case she was still invited to come alone, and she said she wouldn’t do that and that I was being unreasonable. My grandmother also called and said I was being rude and silly, and that it wouldn’t hurt anyone for him to bring his gun and that it would actually make the wedding safer since he used to be in the military. I said it was my and my fiancés wedding and that we got to decide who was there, and since he was being such an aggressive jerk we no longer wanted him to attend.
