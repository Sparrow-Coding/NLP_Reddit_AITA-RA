I won't pretend that everything has been perfect since there have been some difficult moments. Despite everything, I do sincerely adore him.

He and I have had two children together, and whenever I've been pregnant, he starts becoming very touchy with me without my consent. just things like touching and hugging my bump without first asking whether it's okay and completely ignoring the fact that I'm there. He begins referring to the bump as his ""beautiful baby, all his,"" as if he has forgotten that I am the one carrying the child.

I made the decision to use birth control because I didn't want any more kids, and the way he treated me while I was pregnant made me feel deeply uncomfortable. I knew he'd freak out if I told him like normal, so I just kept it under wraps.

I started feeling queasy a week ago, and I was overcome with a genuine fear that I might be pregnant once more. I took a test, and it came back positive, as expected. While I was still in the bathroom, my husband entered after hearing me start to cry. ""You know I want a huge family, so why would you try to sabotage my wishes?"" he said to me. ""It’s like you’re trying to control my wishes; is it not in the name? Birth CONTROL?""

He replaced my birth control pills with placebos once he found them, according to what I learned after we talked about it for about 20 minutes. I'd rather avoid being forced into the role of a human incubator for a child I don't want. I love the two beautiful babies I have now.

Although I feel guilty for not telling him about the birth control, I'm upset with him for switching them out and getting me pregnant without my knowledge. I am worried about what he might do if I decide to have an abortion because he has repeatedly demonstrated his opposition to the idea.

I'll try to keep it somewhat short. 
I was unwillingly brought into a conversation about the ethics of eating animals and veganism.  They asked if I would ever eat dog basically. I said, probably not, because I grew up in a place where dogs are seen as pets, and not as food. Then I said ""but I Mean, if people eat dogs, I dont see that that would be different than eating any other animal"". 
Which (they're vegans) just made them convulse it seemed. 
Then they Said that people who eat dogs, should just be vegan, that they were terrible people for doing that. 

Then I said ""well, places where people eat dogs, it is often their livelihood and the only thing they have access to, or it is a cultural thing, and they don't see the dogs as we in western cultures do"" I also said that ""the dogs in these places aren't bred for pet purposes, and they would never be able to become ""pets"""".

Then here comes where it just went to shit. 
I Then said ""people like us, who are very privileged (like, we are women sitting in our university, because we can get educations... for free! And we can wear whatever we want and talk about whatever we want etc.) Have rarely ever experienced not being able to choose what we eat in some capacity. You cannot just go vegan everywhere, people wouldn't die of starvation or severe malnutrition, if eating leaves and trees were an option. You can go vegan, because you live where you do. Going vegan is a privilege. Choosing what you do and don't eat, and worrying about what others eat, is not something that everyone can just do. 

Then one of them said ""ARE YOU SAYING I/WE ARE PRIVILEGED?!"" And I said, ""well, yes?"" We all are. They Then huffed, some left, and one was like ""that's really fucked up to say"".

And I don't care about these people, they're very uninteresting to me, and honestly I'm hoping they won't like me anymore so they will stop talking to me. 
But I was just so confused at ""privileged"" being a triggering word? Maybe it's cause I'm autistic, but I just don't understand the problem here? I'm used to people disagreeing or having different views, but I have never experienced something like this. 

Also wanna add, everyone else in the room, who weren't part of the conversation really, also seemed quite confused, and one said ""vegans..."" which triggered a whole conversation about the ethics of veganism and the inport of nutmilks and avocados or whatever, luckily I managed to stay out of that one.

They’re a lot of work. I’d rather enjoy other people’s pets, and use my time, energy, and resources elsewhere. My husband (44M), however, is a true dog *lover*, and relies on dogs to help soothe his tendency for anxiety. Against my better judgement, we got two small dogs as newly(ish)weds in 2007. One of them died in 2019, and the other passed a couple months ago. We’ve had our current pupper since January 2020.

My husband’s adoration for these creatures is borderline neurotic, but he is indulgent and undermines my efforts at discipline, so they are not well trained. (For example: one of our now-deceased dogs would regularly pee in our bed, often on my pillow; our current tiny dog leaves tiny messes all over our house, and does not come when she is called). And because Husband works a very demanding job and I a a full-time at-home parent, a lot of the more onerous aspects of pet ownership fall to me; in theory he’s willing to clean up the messes, but it doesn’t work out that way. I’m certainly the only one who changes our bedding. He doesn’t like getting up to take the dog out in the night, so he’s “trained” her to go on our bathroom floor. Often, I’m the first one up, and I hate that my bathroom Is covered in literal crap. When he cleans it up, he refuses to flush the waste down the toilet, so even if the floor is clean (dubious, because doesn’t like using cleaning products), the bathroom still reeks of urine. We are nice, civilized, upper middle class people with a good life and an otherwise beautiful home. He thinks my expectations for and the dog are unreasonable. 

I’ve been accommodating for many years, but I recently hit a wall and can’t take it anymore. I’ve told him, matter of factly and also a bit hysterically, that he can sleep with the dog, if he must. If he does, I choose to sleep in the guest room. (We have a good sex life, and my goal isn’t to mess that up — happy to have afternoon sex or guest room sex or whatever).

Husband has been furious about this for weeks, says I’m unilaterally changing the nature of our marriage, and insists I’m refusing to compromise. I believe I’ve compromised by agreeing to own dogs in the first place, have demonstrated tremendous goodwill by caring for his pets with tenderness, and have been extremely indulgent by allowing the dogs to sleep in our bed for 15+ years.

We were at a little get together at a mutual friends house and we started talking. Now my friend hasn’t seen me since before Covid. That was when I had really short hair, kind of like a boys haircut. But when lockdown happened, I just stopped cutting my hair and let it grow out. It’s now past my shoulders.

So Kiera comes up me and tells me how surprised they are about my hair. I explained what happened and how I just decided to let it grow out on a whim. They asked, “so are you back to being a girl now?” I asked them what they meant and they said they thought I was trans or NB because I had short hair and dressed masculine (we were never super close so I guess they didn’t know me well enough and just assumed). 

I laughed and said no, I’m just a bit of a tom boy and I’ve always been a girl. Kiera laughed and said, “that’s just another way to say closeted gender queer.” I was kind of confused by this and told her I’ve always been a huge Tom boy growing up (wore my brothers clothes, played with his toys, played with boys, was always a boy when I played pretend, hated puberty, etc.) but I’m still a woman. Kiera smirked and said, “I’ve got some news for you friend, you might not be as much of a woman as you think.”

I asked Kiera what they meant by that and they said, “well I was the same way as a kid but I was able to have the courage and confidence to accept my NB identity, you might want to do some reflection if you can’t see it yourself.” I responded saying, “so if I don’t do stereotypically feminine things then I’m not a woman/girl? That’s really sexist, you might want to reevaluate how you see sex stereotypes and gender roles.” 

Kiera kind visibly annoyed and said I was invalidating their identity and being transphobic. I told them that I was happy they felt confident enough to be who they were but insisting everyone who doesn’t follow 1950s-esque sex stereotypes is not a man/woman is incredibly regressive. 

Kiera just huffed and walked away. Later that night our mutual friend said Kiera told them they were really offended by our conversation and they felt unsafe because of it.

English is my 2nd language but apologies for mistakes.  
My problem is as stated on the title. 



I (24) is the youngest of all my cousins on my mother's side who are in 30s. 



As long as I can remember my mother had been helping my aunt raise my cousins. She sent them to school and let my aunt borrow money. She would cook and we would deliver it to their house. 
My dad actually helped my Aunt's husband to get work in his field so that they can afford to buy their house. 





As kids,  I am happy to share anything I have with them. There are even times when I would receive less than them especially on Holidays. Or times that people forgot to give me a gift on Christmas because they have to buy gifts for my cousins first. I was told that I am lucky to have parents who can afford so I should share. I believed them and that has been the way things are growing up





It was after I moved out my city and eventually settled in my dad's home country that I felt I started to have more perspective in life and learned boundaries





This resulted to me going less and less to visit them. Though I visit at least once a month





Grace is older than me (30). She announced she's getting married back in February and I congratulated her. We're close but amongst my cousins she's the one I tend to spend the least amount of time with majorly on different preferences and likes. I respect her since she's older and we had happy times together




3 days ago she sent me a message in a half joking manner that it's her wedding soon (Dec) and she's looking for that one of a kind dress 
for me to buy. 

I was stunned. Literally speechless. I just stared my phone re-reading the text over and over. Knowing her I knew she's not joking at all. 



For info i read it on the notification as I can see it. It doesn't register on my message app that I've read it unless I open it. For this I was truly grateful because I didn't know what to reply. 
I've keep thinking about it, what if the dress was way too expensive, what if she won't like anything? 
I think the wedding dress is very important in any wedding and for that I will never dare to say I will pay for it 



Then after a few hours of not responding my aunt sent me a message nothing direct just the usual. She had messaged me at least 4 times since then but I ignored everything. The only time she would message me is that when needs something and complain how they can't afford anything) 


I feel like I don't want to do it. I hate it when people uses ""jokes"" to ask. 

That's where I am for a day or two but I've made a decision to refuse. Thing is will I be the AiTA if I do this? 

Yes I potentially do have the money but in the past 3 years I have less contact with them I feel my life to have gotten better. 
I want to cut contact but that's impossible with the family I have.

A few days ago, I (30F) was leaving our small town to go to a metro-city hospital for a minor procedure. My father (58M) came to pick me up and drop me off at the airport. He was using my car while I was gone. He is very fit and strong and I am a small woman. I was struggling with my luggage, and he knew that pre-op, I should not lift extra weights, but he did not offer to help -he does these things often. In contrast, when my sister-in-law carries even a small bag of groceries, he runs to help. I was put off but did not say anything. My brother did the same thing again yesterday -he still helps his wife and female friends, but while he has relied on my affective labor for years, he has never paid anything back. I have learned to be very independent as a result, but being vulnerable pre and post-op made me reflect on this. 

Of course, this goes back to our entire childhood. My father worked less than my mom but never helped with any chores,  or childcare. Instead, he always gave her 'work': dinner parties, houseguests, etc. He hit my mother when she protested -and at times, brutally, me and my sister. He is the 'nice guy' for outsiders and has a respectful life. I remember my mom being completely submissive until I was 7-8, but after a while, she started fighting back, and she became a difficult person, abusive back in words with him (and often being short-tempered and physically abusing us). While I do not justify what she did, she has apologized profusely in both words and practical ways. My father has acknowledged that he hit my mom and has tried to make amends, but he has consistently denied any abuse to my sister and I. They are still together, but the dynamic has shifted. 

Last night was one of those nights: I was not there, but have seen it play out. My father was passive-aggressive for days until my mother started arguing. Their argument turned into a full-blown one. Today, my brother who had never endured my dad's abuse, was sarcastic about my mom being a tyrant. I responded soberly to him that the women in our family have learned to demand to be treated with basic respect because asking nicely has not borne fruit. And I mentioned the luggage incident as a 'minor example' of what our mother endured for years. My brother responded that if this bothered me, I 'lack emotional intelligence.'  That hurt. 

A little later my father called and asked if he could talk to me. I responded that 'no, you cannot, until you become a better father to my sister and I; until you show to your son that he cannot call me emotionally unintelligent for expecting a strong man whom I have consistently served to lift my heavy-for-me luggage in return'. My father started crying and said that he knows he was wrong, but he has excuses and I told him 'sorry but' doesn't cut it anymore.

During these shifts she asks me to stay up late since I work 2nd shift and can sleep in. Ideally I would always like to go to bed at 2 am so I can get up at 10 and have enough time in the morning to do stuff. She always asks me “ please stay up till 3 or 3:30 and wake me up before you go to bed don’t even lay down before I’m up” all of these kind of nights  which I do to try and help her. But every single one of these nights I come in the room at 3:30 and try to wake her up she just keeps being like “ I’m tired let me sleep 10 more minutes” or is completely incoherent to what I’m saying in like a half dream state speaking nonsense about work. So I wake her up in 10 minute increments trying to get her to wake up but she always does the same thing “ I’m sleeping 10 more minutes let me sleep more” this has happened for the last 3 months multiple times a week until it’s 4:30 or later ( 15 minutes before she has to work and it takes her 15 minutes to drive to work so it’s URGENT to wake up) and then she finally seems to be able to wake up but treats me like I did absolutely nothing for her throughout the whole night “ WHY WOULDNT YOU WAKE ME UP SOONER I HAVE TO BE AT WORK NOW I’m GOING TO BE LATE” “YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD MAKE SURE I’m UP WHY DIDNT YOU WAKE ME UP” and I try to explain that I tried 5 or 6 times every night to get her up but she doesn’t budge or even try to wake up. I’ve tried turning the light on to help, she just gets mad and frustrated, I’ve tried shaking her she just gets mad or frustrated. I spend these nights up wayyyy past the time I’d like to go to bed just to get yelled and screamed at every morning and called an idiot for not trying harder. She’s like “ why did you not wake me up sooner?!” And I explain that I have tried waking her up every 10-15 minutes since 3:30 or sometimes sooner for her to constantly be upset telling me to let her sleep longer and called an idiot or retarded for even trying to explain my reasoning. It’s seriously putting stress on this relationship and feel like it is not fair the treatment I’m getting for going out of my way to try and help her wake up. And staying up watching stupid YouTube videos past 2 am just to stay awake for her. I seriously don’t know what to do and think she just keeps sleeping cause she knows I am here as a back up and I won’t stop trying until it’s the absolute most urgent time she had to wake up.

I'm not from the us and due to my culture can't move out from my parent's house till I'm married 2.

On to the story:


I (22f) am not working right now because I just graduated college but due to bureaucracy don't have my degree to apply to jobs, I live with my parents and because I don't work I do most of the chores, and sometimes cook too. Yesterday I woke up and did a run through of the apartment, cleaning all the rooms, cleaning the kitchen and washing the dishes also did the laundry and by the time I was done my mom was about to come back from work and I thought I'd take a nap and they'd wake me up for dinner. When I woke up it was 2 am. I got up and I was starving because I'd only eaten an omelet the day before so I went to the fridge to see if they'd left me any food and saw some leftovers from a dish that everyone in my family knows I hate since childhood, I looked everywhere in the kitchen but found that they didn't make anything for me. I was really upset and made myself some ramen that I had hidden from her but couldn't go to sleep because of how upset I was. When my mom woke up for work I asked her why she'd make something that I hate and not make anything for me, she said that I could make myself an omelet or maybe some pasta with chicken. I told her I was so hungry I wouldn't wait for chicken to thaw and I'd only eaten an omelet the day before. She said it's not her fault that I don't like that dish and it's too expensive to make two kinds of food. I told her first I didn't ask you to make two kinds of food, I just asked for something I would eat too. Second my older brother is doing a special diet and whenever he comes over she always accommodates him. 

She replied to the point of my brother and said he's a man so she has to and I could make myself anything because she can't afford this. Btw we are not struggling by any means that something like this would break us. After she said that I just went back to my room while she kept talking at me about how I have to make dinner today because I don't have anything else to do. Once she left for work I broke down crying for hours which seems a bit silly crying over something so small but this isn't the first time and I feel she does this so I wouldn't eat and lose weight because whenever I tell her that I forgot to eat or didn't find anything to eat or even couldn't afford to she'd say good. So this is really bringing back some bad stuff. And when she came back from work she tried talking to me in the kitchen like nothing happened and I just simply replied she got mad because I was being grumpy and disrespectful to her",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4817824,public,top,self,AITA for being rude to my mom after she didn't make me any food?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2m1xj/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_mom_after_she_didnt/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

My ex husband ""Eric"" (40M) and I (38F) were married for 15 years and had 2 children ""Grayson"" (14) and ""Sammie"" (6). In March 2021 we lost a close friend to a drunk driver. After Eric starting drinking really heavily and at times driving. In May 2021 I told Eric to get help or in 6 months the kids and I would leave. Eric decided to double down and started not coming home from the bar. 
Six months later I followed through and left. I immediately filed for divorce. Eric started claiming the normal BS of I do drugs (I had a problem but got help and have been clean now 2.5 years) or I have mental problems. After I provided both were false, I just didn't want to be his wife anymore, he somehow ended up with 50/50 custody. When our son Grayson was at Eric's, Grayson told me his father was drunk and Grayson and Sammie were in very real danger. (Use your imagination and why the police and CPS needed to be involved)
I had moved out and on in my life and had a stable home with my childhood friend and now boyfriend. I was scared because Eric has guns and Grayson knew how to access them. I called for a welfare check on my kids and CPS ended up removing them from Eric's care and placing them with me and my boyfriend, ""Colin"". Colin and I rented a home so all our children have their own room and we got my kids into counseling and worked with CPS to get the kids solely in my custody. 
This was 8 months ago. Since Grayson and Sammie have been solely with Colin and me Eric has not had any contact. In June Eric nearly died from a heart attack while driving. Neither Eric nor his family told us anything. I found out through the police and the insurance company, as we are still on one policy. 
Now, Eric wants to force a relationship with the kids. Grayson wants nothing to do with him and our daughter Sammie, while only 6 is extremely smart and emotionally mature, feels like if she HAS to she will see Eric. 
The problem is, Eric made this choice not to have contact and I feel after abusing Grayson and Sammie seeing it all, that Eric doesn't deserve a second chance. Eric is not getting help for his issues and I know he'll never admit he messed up. So, in his mind he did nothing wrong and doesn't need to change.

I (18m) am thinking about not joining my dad and his girlfriend for Thanksgiving. I want to, but it comes with a few catches that make me feel more anxious and ruin some current plans I have.

For one, I'm just not really interested in the holiday. It's a good chance to cook and eat and talk to people, but other than that, it feels hallow. I have never really liked the holiday either, as it often came with a lot of pressure to eat foods that I didn't like, and interact with family that made me feel stressed or uncomfortable.

The second thing is the schedule. Thanksgiving morning, we would be going up to my dad's girlfriend's family and spending the main day there. I get along with them just fine, but it isn't like I really look forward to it. I feel very different from them, and I feel judged by them often. After that, we'd be going to my dad's friend's for the night, and then the entire next day (Friday) and then a good chunk of Saturday. Again, I don't dislike my dad's friend, but I just don't really like being there, and the idea of spending the entire day and the next day there just doesn't sound fun.

The bigger issue, though, is that I have plans early on that Saturday. Me and my friends are all going to hang out, eat and play DnD. We normally do this weekly, but we had to skip last week. I want to make it special and cook/bake some Thanksgiving classics, and maybe make it a Friendsgiving sort of deal. I would much rather prefer to do this.

I worry that I might be an asshole if I excuse myself from my dad's holiday plans just because I want to hang out with my friends. I also feel bad for not doing anything on Thanksgiving when my family is. On the other hand, these aren't plans I made nor had any involvement or interest in, and I know that spending my Thanksgiving and several days afterwards doing something I dislike would end up making me resent my dad. Especially for putting off an important part of my social life. Plus, my girlfriend tells me that it's a bit selfish of my dad to expect me to be willing to drop everything just for his friends. I don't know what to really think.

background: colleague (J) and I have had many issues including him drunkenly joking that I have small tits then angrily calling me a bitch for ""making him look bad"" by telling another colleague (I had tried to talk to him before I did that but he didn't listen). Another time I asked him for work help and he snapped at me that he's not my fucking babysitter. He's also dismissed issues I've brought up about work saying i'm over reacting even though senior colleagues have gone on to agree with me. Another Colleague (M) has also tried to mediate these issues.

last week we had a big event then party with our clients. J and I had a presentation @ 9:30am the next day, we had been working on it for two weeks and I was nervous as we were presenting to big name brands in our industry. I love partying as much as anyone but had decided I would go home early to be up and ready especially as our city was having transport strikes over these days. J came up to me and said our colleague (M) had bought snow and can we pinky promise not to do any bc of our presentation. I said i wouldn't and was going home early anyway.

Fastforward to the next morning, I'm on the way to work and J messages saying can i being my company hoodie as he stayed in M's hotel as they were out late and he's wearing the same clothes as yesterday. I told him I was already on the way to work. Despite our issues I could have brought it.

I didn't say anything more about it. i was annoyed but continued to joke around with him. M tells me he's proud of me that I didn't stay out to party. J says we need to develop something stronger thank pinky promise as he ended up doing the snow and i respond that it's not my proble he can't keep promises.

Some time later J and I get into a fight where he calls me unprofessional because i didn't want to talk to him after he was rude to me. I didn’t mention J’s attire for our presentation but said after what he’s said before he should be thanking me for still having a job instead of being rude to me. I complained to M saying how dare J call me unprofessional for that considering his behaviour before and how he showed up to our presentation. 

X defends him saying he was sad about him and his husband breaking up (something he told me 2 weeks ago) around 3:30am and J stayed to comfort him. That what if it was me? He also says i should take this to my grave. (He didn't tell me about the snow). I responded that J should have been home already at 3:30 am and that I wouldn't even have been there at that time. I also asked M if he was ok?

M thinks I'm being unfair since it was ""his fault"" J was out and wore the same clothes from the night before. I told him even though it doesn't change much ""from a professional standpoint"" he should let everyone else who is talking about this know.

Me and this friend were pretty close, hung out on a weekly basis and I’d stay at her house often and sleep on a couch in another room as we had a very platonic friendship, as well and she’d help me with errands as she drives and I do not. On Halloween we spoke on the phone as we were at separate parties and she said someone who did some bad things to her in the past was there and since she was drunk she wanted to fight them or hurt them in some way and I helped talk her down.

I then offered to get a cab and we’d pick her up and go back to her place and chill as the parties were coming to an end, she agreed and we kept talking and I told her updates on if the cab was close  and it eventually came . I was broke at the time but I’m close with this cab company so they let me get the cab for free if I paid back double the ride the following week. She wasn’t too far from the party I was at but since I had to pay double it was gona be around a $40 trip for me. Halfway there I tell her I’m halfway there, she tells me she doesn’t wanna go home with anybody, after I had already left and was close to her now, I could’ve saved a lot of money (for a broke guy) if she just told me this in the first place. She then started to get mad at me for being a bit annoyed about the situation because I didn’t have to help her out ( she was broke too) but I even said I’d get the cab for her anyways and she just said she doesn’t need it. Okay cool so I told the driver just to take me home, no prob. She got pissed again bringing up stuff she knows I’m sensitive about and that I’ve talked about in confidence using it against me even though she claimed before she was fine with these things, overall kinda just being bitter and rude, thinking I went home “just because I wanted to go over to her house”. Like seriously I have my own bed that has nothing to do with it you told me to go home. Anyways, she stops talking to me after I say “whatever just let me know when you’re home safe”. I ask again in the morning with no response. 

A week or two pass and I ask her if she’s still upset , no reply

Then I say something along the lines of okay, you’re my friend and I appreciate you but I can’t keep playing this game if not knowing if we are friends or not, I got lots of love for you etc etc, nothing crazy just speaking my mind.
No reply so I give it another week.

Eventually I snap internally and I tell her okay are you still mad?  Because if this is how you’re acting I can’t do this, I’m going to have to permanently block your contact if you’re going to treat me like I’m nothing. And she removed me as soon as she read it. 

I still have her on socials and I assume her phone number but, I feel she was in the wrong here overall but,

I wear blue contacts, always curl my hair, tease it to have volume, and dye it blonde. After my transformation, I feel more confident, so my whole aura changes, too.

Only my family knows what I look like without makeup and my hair done. None of them can recognize me as the same person. I decided to show my best friend and she looked shocked. I asked her if she can recognize me. She said she can't, and said I look like a completely different ethnicity without my makeup on. She claimed I don't look white anymore. I look fully Asian now. 

I asked what she thinks my boyfriend would think if he ever sees me without makeup. She said she thinks I'm deceiving people by changing the way I look so much. I got mad because I'm not ""deceiving"" people. I simply want to look better. She argued makeup is to enhance your natural appearance, not to completely change every facial feature. I argued that there's nothing wrong with altering how I look. She said it's too excessive if I look like a whole new person. I don't agree that it's deceiving because people should know I look different without makeup. She argued that's true, but that I look completely unrecognizable while other friends are still recognizable, just not as good looking.

I don't care if I'm not recognizable. This doesn't mean I'm ""deceiving"" people. She's so rude for saying that. She said it is deceiving because even though she knew I'm full Asian, she always thought I looked white. She claimed it's deceiving with the blonde hair, blue eyes, double eyelids, and high nose bridge.

This past summer my bestie broke up with her bf of 4 years and is now in what I call her ‘glow era’. She’s juggling a few boys and is entering the dating scene for the first time ever and is really coming into herself, and I couldn’t be happier for her. I am her biggest cheerleader and she knows it. 

I, however, am not so well. After living out of state for 4 years, I moved to a city 40 mins from her, got hired at a restaurant, and jumped head first into a situationship with one of my coworkers (don’t recommend) all within the span of a month. We partied all summer and fell in love. In September I left that place of work because of him and his lies and hoe-ishness. I also recently blocked him. So I’m now jobless, reluctantly single, and no longer hanging with my new friends in my new city because they all do too much coke and I can’t be tempted. Woo!

So my bestie is thriving, as she should!!!!!! But I’m not. And that’s ok!! We don’t have to be on the same level always. That’s life.

But I’m leaning on her for support just as she does with me, and I’m not receiving the same care or consideration, or hyping up that I provide for her. I’ve brought it to her attention and all she says is “I thought we talked about this. I know you’re a better friend to me than I am to you. I want to be better”.

Now that sounds nice right? Sounds like she wants to but doesn’t know how?

Quick backstory: we have had two falling outs early in the friendship due to her selfishness. It’s something I have chosen to look past.

At this point, being as though I hyped her up to being as confident as she is now (yes she gives me credit), and she’s not giving me the same KNOWING how low I am, on top of all the little selfish things she does…… We have a rave planned for this weekend, just us two. Today she texted me saying she invited another girl she’s recently close with and whom I do not know. Normally that would be ok I guess, but I already expressed not even a week ago how upset I was when she came to my city to go out with me, and ended up just aggressively flirting with strangers all night, ignoring me, knowing how bad I needed that night bc I’ve been so sad. 

She’s consistently a selfish person, it’s her thing. But it’s always been in ways that I can deal with. I have no problem sacrificing more to make her comfy. Im selfless and she’s selfish, it’s a balance? Idk anymore.

Now I’m starting to really rethink our friendship. And I hate that I am. I do love her so much and there is SO MUCH good with us. But I can’t help feeling this way. I feel so alone in a new city, freshly heartbroken, and she’s not there the way I’m there for her. I feel so alone. 

I don’t want to be rash or impulsive, and I don’t want to end the friendship. I told her I’m not going to the rave anymore because she invited another girl. I’m also rethinking moving to florida with her because I don’t know if living with someone so selfish is good for me despite all the good in her.

For context, yesterday, Tuesday, was my grandma's funeral. She was 83 years old. She was my mother's mother. After the funeral we had a family luncheon where there was a lot of leftover food and at the end of it it was kind of a free-for-all. Family members and others grabbed the leftover food and drinks that weren't eaten or opened and took it home with them.  The one thing that I wanted to take home was a pumpkin pie.  Every year at Thanksgiving it seems like by the time dinner is done I never end up actually getting a slice of pumpkin pie and if I do it's typically a very tiny piece. I love pumpkin pie. Outside of Apple it's really the only pie that I like. 

Here is where my AITA comes in.  I woke up from a nightmare at around 2 AM and got a slice of pumpkin pie. Keep in mind this is just a Walmart bought pumpkin pie, not made from scratch. It's like $4. I explained that I would either not eat any pumpkin pme I'm compiled on Thanksgiving then or I would just replace an entire pumpkin pie before Thanksgiving Day.  After I got the pumpkin pie. To quote my mother she said ""if you went over to get a piece of pie at 2:00 in the morning and couldn't wait until Thanksgiving Day then you are truly more mentally unstable than I thought.""  And then gave me a hard time for accidently waking her up, even though I didn't mean to wake her up, however she is the person that I would want to find comfort in in regards to my grandma passing because she is my mother. So it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that she would be upset with me for wanting to confide in her and talk to her when she is upset about her own mother passing. This really hurts my heart. Sometimes I feel like my own mother doesn't love me, but certainly loves my siblings.

Well since my grandmother passed away on Wednesday. I actually found her and her bed maybe 5 minutes after she had passed. I haven't been sleeping very well. I don't sleep very well in general but this is added to my insomnia even more so. I've been having some more nightmares. Well, the person that I want to talk to to comfort me after a nightmares is my mother but my mom is grieving the death of her mom son it's a tricky situation. She doesn't seem bothered by older brother or younger sister confiding in her about anything, so i definitely feel middle child syndrome.

leave (we will call her friend 1), this isn’t a problem as I was getting bored so we decided to end the call. Not even 30 minutes later F 1 was on another call with F 2, F 3, and F4. I wanted to know why F 1 was on a call so I joined it. 
       “F 1” I called repeatedly, no answer. I was upset as she was not responding on the call, but I brushed it off as I figured there was something wrong with my mic. I left and texted to the group chat,
        “Am I on mute or smth? Or are you guys just not responding?” In a sorta serious way. F 1 proceeded to ask me if I was on the call, I told her for a solid 5m. I was kind of annoyed but then I remembered I wasn’t forcing my voice like I usually was to make it louder. I still thought there might be something wrong with my mic so I continued to ask them questions. 
         F 5 came around back to the group chat saying, “Dang anyways”. That pissed me off. I have anger issues, it sucks, it really does. I kindly told her to “stfu” as I was trying to address something and she told me, “no, anyways imma go play!” That’s when I asked the group chat,
          “What would you guys do if you were trying to talk about something important and than you friend tries to change the subject? Hmm?” F 1 answered me saying, “I would just stayed quite or I would say that HEY I WAS TALKING” (quoted directly) F 3 then came saying what I was talking about, I told her I was talking about F 1.
            F 1 left the fucking group chat. I finally asked if I could discuss what I wanted to (AKA my mic). Then F 2 (the one who had been friends with F 1 the longest) said, “Why is she so dramatic” (She was talking about F 1). Then before I could even start discussing the mic thing F 2 sent a screenshot of to the group chat. It was F 1 and F 2 talking.

I told him I would turn the volume up louder for him to better himself next song. He said ok and signed up for another song.

When it was his turn again, the first he did when he got on stage was to move my speaker again. Because of the way my set up was, I couldn't go mid song to move the speaker back. The song was done and I had asked, ""Please don't move my speaker again. If you do, at least put it back in position.""

He laughingly tells me eff off. One his friends, who is also bartender friend of mine, talks to him and comes back up to me. He apologizes, says he can't hear out of one ear so that's why he moved my speaker. I told him, if that's the case just tell me and I would move it for him. He then says he's going to tip me as a further apology and asks my Cash App. I tell him it's not necessary since he already apologized but he keeps insisting.

I again tell him it's not necessary to tip that much and I accepted his apology. He refuses saying that if the speakers are worth $500 then he'll pay for half, $200. He clicked send and my Cash App now had an extra $200.

I thanked him even though in the back of my mind I'm thinking he's going to try and break my speaker now. He asks if he can sing again and I say yes and this time, I would move the speaker for him.

The owners of the house I’m renting are going to sell and have asked me to move out on the 19th December (rude asf) 
So I’ve been applying for houses but the rental market where i am is terrible- so many people are looking to rent and there are no houses available! 
I’ve found one that comes available on the 29th which leaves me and my two girls homeless for 10 days with little to no support. 

I asked my older sister if we could stay with her for 10 days over Christmas so my girls have a roof over their heads and somewhere stable for Christmas- i did expect her to say yes which might be entitled of me. 
But a few years ago i let her and my 3 nieces/nephew stay with me and my girls in a 2 bedroom flat. Her kids had my daughters room, she slept in my bed while i slept on a couch for 3 months with my daughter and other daughter in a cot. For three months i gave her my bed. She didn’t contribute financially during this time but thats fine i would do anything for her.
I called her tonight quite upset because i feel as if I’ve failed my girls and just need somewhere to be. So I  asked her if we could stay for 10 days and she was not empathetic to my situation AT ALL. She was very monotone and just said “Wellll if you want to stay here there’s a few things and conditions you should think about” i was upset and just said its fine I’ll find somewhere else and hung up
I really didn’t expect to be let down by her. We’ve been through some hard times and I thought we were like best friends. But i feel so bad, maybe i overreacted.

Well, I compromised and said between us, I could do four feet but my dog WOULD get in their yard. Well, then Edward (name changed) came along. Edward is their 64 year old son. He is intellectually disabled. Originally I tried being friendly because I know intellectual disabilities aren’t anyones fault. Then Edward started coming over, walking in my yard with an invite, knocking on my door every couple of hours so I still tried being nice… then he started saying stuff about me not being home. After that, he told my contractor that he’s been looking in my windows and coming into my yard.

I’m a single female and that just makes me super uncomfortable. So, I went back to the 6 foot fence between our homes. Now Edward screams at me whenever he sees my car, he screams about my dog and my fence, and his parents keep calling the city about me even though I haven’t done anything wrong. The sheriff even came to talk to me and said he came up just to look like they were following up, but the city appreciates me being here.

My husband (58m) hates when I (23f) am talking to him while scrolling through my phone. I'm a multi-task kind of person and so I could focus on doing 2 things at once like checking my Instagram while listening to him. He likes to throw a hissy fit when seeing me with the phone in hand.   


Recently he has given me an ultimatum saying next time he sees me using my phone while talking to him the phone would have to go. I thought that was overboard, because it's not like I'm ignoring him when he's talking about serious stuff. BUT he just wants me to be 200% listening when he talks about his business or a past trip with his buddies.


Saturday, I was in our home theatre scrolling through my phone when he came and sat across from me. He told me to put the phone down. I asked why and whether he had something serious to talk about but he said no, nothing serious and reminded me of what he told me about the phone while talking rule. I was like ""umm no"".


He got up, took it out of my hand and rushed out while I yelled at him asking where he was taking it. He got outside and threw it in the jacuzzi while I watched. I couldn't believe it I started yelling WTF at him repeatedly. We got into a huge argument and he decided to get in his car and leave to go play golf.


I was mad I texted him that what he did was out of line and that I expect him to replace my phone asap. He responded saying he already set one reasonable rule and I violated it and disrespected him and his presence and time. We had another argument after he got home and I kept insisting on having my phone replaced, he said that I made things get this far by refusing to listen and choosing to be disrespectful.

Thankfully I have an old iPhone 13 I'm using for now until he changes his mind.

I live in an apartment so I don't have a garden. A wonderful dog, but... she is highly specific on where she wants to go do her business. It took months for her to choose a spot where she wanted to go and will only go there. She doesn't mark on walks and when we're out for an entire day she will hold it in until we're back on that one spot. Difficult, to say the least... She's highly suspicious of other dogs so going anywhere where she'd be distracted by other dogs is definitely a no-go.

  
Eventually, we made do with the few spots she decided on. To be clear: SHE picked those spots; not me. I could bring her to a park all day and she will still decide for herself where she wants to go.   


About two weeks ago, we moved to a different apartment. I managed to build this up slowly for her; months in advance and... yes!... victory!... She does her business in the same street as the new apartment! I was, of course, very happy about this. Of course there is room for improvement, as she currently wees on the sidewalk. The sidewalk is about 10m (32ft) away from the apartment-complex, on public road. 

A few days ago, an elderly neighbour (two buildings down from where I live and in view of where my dog does her business) began to knock on her window and shouting at me that I should not let my dog wee there. I tried to explain to her that my dog is still a dog in training and that her situation is a bit tricky, but she had already slammed the window shut. Now every single time I go outside; even when my dog doesn't do anything at all; she is staring at me. 

I've been taking a little water bottle with me to throw onto my dog's wee (and obviously I always clean up her poop anyway!). 

I personally don't think it's a big deal when a dog goes on the sidewalk; which isn't directly in front of anyone's walkway to their house, etc, but maybe I'm wrong.

I can occasionally hear neighbours, doing normal neighbourly things.. Starting cars, closing doos, talking, yelling, cooking etc.

I (f17) hate physical contact with most people unless 1. They ask for it because they need it. 2. It’s my boyfriend. So onto the situation. 

This just happened. I’m still crying about it. My dad comes into my room around midnight after getting off the phone with his EX who has been lying to BOTH OF US for a couple months and I’m extremely mad at because I have “trauma” with people lying to me and in general, major, major trust issues. But the exact stories on where those came from isn’t important. 

So, he comes in and tells me why his ex feels like I’m pushing her away. (Which is true. I don’t feel comfortable talking or associating myself with someone who looked me in the eyes and lied about being in a relationship when she was still with my dad. She started a relationship a month before they broke up or so I have found out now. They had been flirting for a couple months.) He tells me that she feels I’m pushing her away because she’s in a relationship. Not 100% true, I’m pushing her away because she looked me in the eyes, directly when we were having a heart to heart in my bedroom and lied to me. She told me she wasn’t going to start dating for a while but that ended up already being a lie.

He comes into my room tonight/this morning and starts talking to me about how she’s feeling and how he was “defending me” for an hour and we have a long, upsetting conversation for me because I don’t feel the desire to talk about my trust issues. Especially with my father who has made me feel like the victim in so many situations, like I’m the one to blame, and would just in general be the world’s worst therapist. We finish up the conversation, he walks towards me in my bed for a hug. Now, he knows I HATE HATE HATE hugs. It’s been a common thing for me for years at this point. I don’t like being touched, especially if I’m upset like I was due to the conversation. I reminded him “I don’t like hugs. I don’t want a hug.” But that didn’t stop him and he hugged me anyway. He then went to pat my shoulder, and already uncomfortable from the hug, I moved away from him. 

He told me then, “you do not do that to your dad.” I then explained, yet again, I don’t like hugs. And then he came back at me with “you need to be less selfish, maybe dad needed a hug.” (I’ve also explained to him that if he wants a hug, just say it and I’ll give him one. I just don’t like being forced into one. If he has just told me “hey I really need a hug, can I get one from you?” That would be no problem for me.) 

The other thing is that when we have been in situations like this before where we’re fighting or whatever, we’ve worked out other ways to make peace like a high five or a fist bump. So it’s not like we haven’t worked something out before.

5 days ago, my friend(L) &amp; godmother to my 14yo son(R) gifted him a puppy(M) out of the blue, w/o asking me ahead. Just straight up arrived at our house for what should be a normal hangout with a puppy handed to R as a surprise. 

It was a huge shock. I've never owned or cared about having a pet in my life. Told L I don't know how to care for a dog, she said no problem R would learn and care for it, I'll teach him, don't worry. All this in front of R, which made responding even more confusing for me. Didn't have time to process it. 

We received the pup dumbfounded then right away, L had to go, she just meant to drop off her gift in between her very busy schedule before flying back home. And just like that, we now have a pet. 

It didn't really sink in yet but I thought ok this is about R who really enjoys dogs (though he never asked for one) and might greatly benefit from having a companion in our lonely home with his depression. People before have suggested he get a pet for this reason. I also felt bad turning L's gift down. She's the mother of all grand gestures yet I know she means well and cares for R.

I decided to give it a try on one condition: that R will be responsible for taking care of M except when he's in school. He agreed. I called L right away and said this was all so sudden and since I wasn't prepared beforehand, this will be a 2 week trial period for us to learn and do our best, and that we may give M back if we can't handle it, L agreed. So the very next day, we took M to the vet, bought supplies, had him groomed, etc.

R instantly fell in love with M and I've never seen him so happy. But it's still very intimidating and I still feel ambushed. Currently my house isn't fully arranged for a training a puppy with designated areas. Work and parenting is already hectic enough for me as a single parent without any help. As each day passed, we are learning that taking care of M in a way that suits our lifestyle is just too stressful. What makes this even harder is we have already fallen in love with M and its a sad thought to see him for the last time.

Then 2 days ago R got fed up when after his long day out, he came home to M rolling over on its pee, stepping on its poop then walking around the living room spreading all the dirt. R is a germaphobe with OCD. It took tears and self-loathing on his part before R finally said he couldn't do it long term. It was heartbreaking to see R bawling while petting the dog. That night out of exhaustion, I asked for L to have M picked up she said ok but we have to wait 2 more days for someone to pick it up. I have no way of transporting the dog myself.

Lots of background, so skip to bold section if wanted. I don't wanna shock anyone so I will start off by saying I am a mother of 16, only 2 of which are alive. My husb and I had chosen ""Tamika"" and ""George"" as baby names before we married.

Pregnancy 1: We fell pregnant soon ""after"" marriage (in reality it's why we married). My intuition believed it was a boy, but we never knew because we lost the baby right after our honeymoon.

Pregnancy 2: My 2nd pregnancy gave me my first Tamika in 2008.

Pregnancy 3: My 3rd pregnancy was also successful and I birthed my first George in early 2011.

Only nine days after George was born, Tamika died tragically.

Pregnancies 4 and 5: My 4st and 5th pregnancies resulted in miscarriage.

George died from an infection only a month before his 2nd birthday.

Pregnancy 6: I gave birth to my preemie Tamika in 2013, exactly two years and eleven months after George was born.

After two weeks, Tamika couldn't do it anymore.

Pregnancies 7-11: All were miscarriages except the 11th, which was twin boys. One absorbed the other before we came up with a second name, and although we expected George to make it, he was stillborn at 38 weeks.

I got clean in 2015 because I needed to do better for my self, husband, and future family.

Pregnancy 12: We tried IVF after months of infertility, and the first pregnancy lasted only three weeks.

Pregnancy 13: I gave birth to my IVF son George in mid-2017, and he beat the odds. He is what we'll talk about in a bit.

Pregnancy 14: Tamika also beat the odds, and she is a thriving 2-year-old girl aside from breaking 27 bones in her right hand earlier this year. She's okay now and is adapting to using her left hand.

Pregnancy 15: This one wasn't intentional, but even though we were excited, it wasn't meant to be.

**My dilemma**

My immediate family are the only ones who know I and my husb reused names of our deceased children. We don't feel an issue, as we never got a chance to watch Tamika and George grow up. None of our pregnancies except our 13th (and soon 14th) made it to the age of three, so we felt robbed of our dream children. But with a bit of faIth, trVst, and pixie dustF (IVF), we have our George and Tamika again.

George is at an age where he can understand things, and he knows about death. Today, after many typical questions about miscarriages, I told him about his longlost siblings. I used the stork analogy to explain how the babies flew in from Asia and flew back real quick (I was Today Years Old when I found out storks are real, THX TikTok!). Once I told George that he had two brother Georges, he said, quote, ""I don't wanna be named after a dead brother! No one is named after their brother! Even wolves!""

I (f26) have a son (m5 months) who I'll call M with my husband (m27) A. We are hosting Thanksgiving this year so for the last few days I've been prepping ahead what I can. Most of my prep happens after M falls asleep around 1030pm. M is glued to me so I don't really do anything until after he's asleep. Last night I put him to bed around 1030 like usual and went out to the kitchen to make some homemade butter for Thanksgiving.

M sleeps in our bed, and before you get at me for that I have tried to put him to sleep in his own space and he wakes up and screams until he's back in our bed. He hated his bassinet, crib, pack n play, twin I put next to my bed with baby rails, etc. I've tried every method I could find on Google on how to get him to sleep on his own. (Open to suggestions id love to not be awake most nights worrying) Nothing has worked. We have a Cal king so he gets his own side of the bed. We have no sheets, blankets, pillows (my husband has one but he sleeps on the other end of the bed so he's always a few feet away from the baby with me in the middle so no way for his pillow to even touch M) etc. We have a firm mattress as well. M sleeps with his feet toward my hip so if by some chance I rolled I'd roll on his feet first. I've taken every precaution I can in allowing him to sleep in our bed. M sleeps in cotton pajamas and our room is around 70°. 

After I put him to bed I started working in the kitchen as A said he was going to sleep and I said ok goodnight and though nothing of it. 2  hours goes by and I went to check on M. I walked into our room and M's entire  face  was covered with a blanket. I freaked out and uncovered him &amp; woke him up to make sure he was ok.. Other than being a little warm he was ok. A woke up &amp;I started yelling at him about how he almost killed M by suffocating him under a blanket. How could he be so irresponsible and why would he even cover M with a blanket in the first place etc. We got up this morning and he was being sulky so I asked him what his problem was and he said I was an asshole to him last night. M didn't die and wasn't harmed so I didn't need to make him feel like M almost died. I asked him why he had a blanket on the bed in the first place and he said he was cold and didn't think one blanket would even be a big deal and he likes to sleep in boxers but can't because I won't let him have a blanket until M is out of our bed and i overreacted. I've told him dozens of times no blankets. He said I could have been nicer in how I told him not to do that, but ive also explained to him many times on why no blankets. Maybe i could have been nicer about it, but I also was panicking from seeing our 5m/os face coveted by a blanket.

I never really worried too much because nobody is near enough and can see through my windows especially with the blinds closed or so I thought. But to my horror, when I came home one day, the wall which appeared to be a solid wall this whole time actually had openings at the top covered by some sort of flyscreen (which I only noticed this time because they were open and lights were on, I didn't notice earlier because of years of dirt making it all the same colour), through which I could see a room was there I was a bit worried but it looked like the top of some storage room so I thought to myself hopefully nobody really goes in there and its too high up for anyone to look through the opening, but to my horror there was a person on the opposite far side of the room and it was safe to assume they could clearly see through the window because they were looking straight at me.

George is at an age where he can understand things, and he knows about death. Today, after many typical questions about miscarriages, I told him about his longlost siblings. I used the stork analogy to explain how the babies flew in from Asia and flew back real quick (I was Today Years Old when I found out storks are real, THX TikTok!). Once I told George that he had two brother Georges, he said, quote, ""I don't wanna be named after a dead brother! No one is named after their brother! Even wolves!""

I tried so hard to have a George but now he is ungrateful. I think he should be proud to be named after my first Georges. It's normal.

We decided we'd still live here until May next year, and split the apartment. Our lease is indefinite, so we can leave whenever we want with a months notice

We decided to stay here, because he's waiting for a permanent contract at his job, and he felt uncomfortable starting a years lease before he'd have a permanent contract, which is understandable

He's been going through a hard time, and i want to be there for him, but i feel like it's getting unhealthy. He lost all of his friends recently, and had a massive fight with his best friend over the weekend that might not be salvageable. I feel like he has a lot of built up anger, and that it affects me negatively, and that ultimately pushed his friends away too. I became his only support, and he refuses to get professional help

He's been very respectful of me since our breakup though, with some anger outbreaks (which are understandable, i did break up with him so he's entitled to be angry), but generally he's been amicable. I just feel like i need my own space to heal and build my own life back up. I feel responsible for his wellbeing, and i don't think that's healthy

I told him today that i do want to start looking at places sooner than May next year. I also told him i wouldn't just get up and leave. I want to make sure he has a place first, i also suggested he could get a roommate to take my part of the place, so he doesn't have to start a new lease. He got extremely upset. He said i betrayed him and went back on my word to stay here until next year. He said i bring his livelyhood in jeopardy and that i'm taking away his only stability, since he's an expat and he's been anxious about his job. I do understand where he's coming from, but he gets paid twice my salary, and his company already voiced their intentions to keep him permanently. I'm also fine taking a few months to look into places or roommates for him. I just don't see myself living here and being his support system for another 7 months

He stormed off and took his belongings into a different room, and took all of my belongings out of there and put them in the hallway. He wouldn't talk to me. I asked him to stop touching my things, he wouldn't stop. I kept pushing him to talk to me, which in hindsight was stupid of me, because he clearly needed space, so i think he held his composure when i did that

I understand he feels upset and hurt and it really does feel like his life is kind of crumbling down, and i feel extremely guilty for it. The last thing he needed was the last person abandoning him too, i'm worried for his mental health. He has no one else to talk to. I feel like a massive asshole for wanting to leave too, but the negativity has been so overwhelming, i've been a crying mess for a few days now. I'm so tired, i just need some space

Last year my biz made 130k, this year, $70k. That, minus paying staff and taxes, makes a major dent in my income.

I have two primary jobs and one side hustle; walking dogs, which requires a car. My boyfriend (33) was highly supportive of this until he realized that sometimes, there may be issues with him wanting to go to a bar with friends while I need the car for an hour to make $20 to pay the majority of bills and walk a dog.

So much so, that sometimes I have to take an Uber to a dog walk just to break even.

His parents and sister pay him constantly for… existing. I don’t have that. I have 3 jobs, 1FT, 2PT and it sucks to feel like IMMMM the burden for needing the car (in his name) for an hour before he can go to the bar.

He hasn’t had a job since Pre covid. I pay 2/3 rent and be pays 1/3. We split other bills. But he sits around all day aside from chores and plays video games and watches Netflix. 

I appreciate his family supporting him as he is a budding author, but it hurts to be pulling the weight and doing the work and to be told I “can’t use the car when I want to be at the bar.”

Long post, requires background. I don't wanna shock anyone so I will start off by saying I am a mother of 16, only 2 of which are alive. My husb and I had chosen ""Tamika"" and ""George"" as baby names before we married.

**Pregnancy 1**

We fell pregnant soon ""after"" marriage (in reality it's why we married). My intuition believed it was a boy, but we never knew because we lost the baby right after our honeymoon.

**Pregnancy 2**

My 2nd pregnancy gave me my first Tamika in 2008.

**Pregnancy 3**

My 3rd pregnancy was also successful and I birthed my first George in early 2011.

**Tamika passes away**

Only nine days after George was born, Tamika died tragically.

**Pregnancies 4 and 5**

My 4st and 5th pregnancies resulted in miscarriage.

**George passes away**

George died from an infection only a month before his 2nd birthday.

**Pregnancy 6**

I gave birth to my preemie Tamika in 2013, exactly two years and eleven months after George was born.

**Tamika dies**

After two weeks, Tamika couldn't do it anymore.

**Pregnancies 7-11**

All were miscarriages except the 11th, which was twin boys. One absorbed the other before we came up with a second name, and although we expected George to make it, he was stillborn at 38 weeks.

**I sobered up**

I got clean in 2015 because I needed to do better for my self, husband, and future family.

**Pregnancy 12**

We tried IVF after months of infertility, and the first pregnancy lasted only three weeks.

**Pregnancy 13**

I gave birth to my IVF son George in mid-2017, and he beat the odds. He is what we'll talk about in a bit.

**Pregnancy 14**

Tamika also beat the odds, and she is a thriving 2-year-old girl aside from breaking 27 bones in her right hand earlier this year. She's okay now and is adapting to using her left hand.

**Pregnancy 15**

This one wasn't intentional, but even though we were excited, it wasn't meant to be.

**My dilemma**

My immediate family are the only ones who know I and my husb reused names of our deceased children. We don't feel an issue, as we never got a chance to watch Tamika and George grow up. None of our pregnancies except our 13th (and soon 14th) made it to the age of three, so we felt robbed of our dream children. But with a bit of faIth, trVst, and pixie dustF (IVF), we have our George and Tamika again.

I told my husband and he told me that I should explore my identity more, so while he was away for work I kissed a woman at a club. It was a great kiss if I’m being honest. She was beautiful. But I had a panic attack the next day because I couldn’t believed I had consentingly “cheated.” He assured me it was fine and supported me through my big emotions which made me felt safe in ways I had never experienced before. I was so happy! When he came come, there was a opportunity to have sex with a girl that I met on a dating app, I was hesitant because he had just came home and we hadn’t seen each other in months. He told me to go for it so I went. We ended up not having sex but doing other things. I didn’t have a panic attack this time but I was very ready to get back to him. Ever since then he’s been talking about, asking about, angry about having a 3some. We had talked about it before I did my explorations but it was only a concept. I realized I had some insecurities and have been trying to work on them for myself and for this possible experience but it’s been difficult. We had a “practice experience” where we both kissed a mutual friend and I had a hard time with that. Maybe it’s hypocritical but seeing him kiss another woman so eagerly bothered me. Long story short he didn’t like how long it took me to process it. He compares it to him being 100% okay with me having sex with a woman but I had troubles with him kissing another one while I was there. I tried to tell him that I’m just trying to take my time because I don’t want to hurt our marriage and I’m scared but he only sees it as me being controlling. He says it’s supposed to be a 50/50 relationship and I’m not playing by those rules anymore. I didn’t know what to do because it was a big leap of trust for him to let me explore like this. I’m trying to be more open and more supportive but he says I don’t enjoy his pleasure enough. Recently he has even asked me to imagine him fucking other women while we have sex to see how erotic it is, or to imagine him as someone else. I don’t like it but I’m trying to be open to his sexuality too. But he’s still upset about not having a 3some and the ball always being in my court. I feel like a huge hypocrite but this has consumed all aspects of our life over the last couple months. I don’t want a 3some right now and maybe at this point ever.

This is a long one and requires background. I don't want to shock anyone so I will start off by saying I am a mother of 16, only 2 of which are alive. My husb and I had chosen ""Tamika"" and ""George"" as baby names before we married.

**Pregnancy 1**

We fell pregnant soon ""after"" marriage (in reality it's why we married). My intuition believed it was a boy, but we never knew because we lost the baby right after our honeymoon.

**Pregnancy 2**

My 2nd pregnancy gave me my first Tamika in 2008.

**Pregnancy 3**

My 3rd pregnancy was also successful and I birthed my first George in early 2011.

**Tamika passes away**

Only nine days after George was born, Tamika died tragically.

**Pregnancies 4 and 5**

My 4st and 5th pregnancies resulted in miscarriage.

**George passes away**

George died from an infection only a month before his 2nd birthday.

**Pregnancy 6**

I gave birth to my preemie Tamika in 2013, exactly two years and eleven months after George was born.

**Tamika dies**

After two weeks, Tamika couldn't do it anymore.

**Pregnancies 7-11**

All were miscarriages except the 11th, which was twin boys. One absorbed the other before we came up with a second name, and although we expected George to make it, he was stillborn at 38 weeks.

**I sobered up**

I got clean in 2015 because I needed to do better for my self, husband, and future family.

**Pregnancy 12**

We tried IVF after months of infertility, and the first pregnancy lasted only three weeks.

**Pregnancy 13**

I gave birth to my IVF son George in mid-2017, and he beat the odds. He is what we'll talk about in a bit.

**Pregnancy 14**

Tamika also beat the odds, and she is a thriving 2-year-old girl aside from breaking 27 bones in her right hand earlier this year. She's okay now and is adapting to using her left hand.

**Pregnancy 15**

This one wasn't intentional, but even though we were excited, it wasn't meant to be.

**My dilemma**

My immediate family are the only ones who know I and my husb reused names of our deceased children. We don't feel an issue, as we never got a chance to watch Tamika and George grow up. None of our pregnancies except our 13th (and soon 14th) made it to the age of three, so we felt robbed of our dream children. But with a bit of faIth, trVst, and pixie dustF (IVF), we have our George and Tamika again.

George is at an age where he can understand things, and he knows about death. Today, after many typical questions about miscarriages, I told him about his longlost siblings. I used the stork analogy to explain how the babies flew in from Asia and flew back real quick (I was Today Years Old when I found out storks are real, THX TikTok!). Once I told George that he had two brother Georges, he said, quote, ""I don't wanna be named after a dead brother! No one is named after their brother! Even wolves!""

My parents, siblings, sisters husband, gf, her siblings and mom came. The mom drank most of the wine and got drunk which was pretty fucking rude, I talked to my gf and wanted to kick her out but gf said no and she's family and important. Later she went off about how she fucked some guys at the bar, about the evil orange man, yes that's what she said literally refering to him as orange man, then she went into the cabinet chugged our jack Daniels and ran around outside naked. She threw the food on the floor too, I was so fucking pissed she knocked the Turducken down. Most of it was salvageable but still.

I told my gf she's banned from ever entering our house again, her mom is a degenerate piece of shit and she's not welcome at my house again. My gf was pissed I talked about her mom that way but who tf does this, this was so ridiculous. Gf is saying this was a one time mistake, which I have doubts and even if it is in not taking risks again. I don't want her mom in our life at all she's a massive train wreck until she gets herself sorted. 

This put a massive strain on my relationshjip with my girlfriend. I never hosted her again at my house and the only times i saw her was at events on herside of the family and she would do similar stuff and call me a drunk inbred redneck and how her family is too high class for us. I tried to ignore her. 

I'm hosting thanksgiving again since most of their family is sick with some weird disease they got in africa. My girlfriend is pissed saying its rude her mom isn't invited to my thanksgiving.

When he was 18, Jeff got married and joined the military. Because of his job,he hasn't lived in our city for years. We have remained close despite distance and have been there for each other during major life events including the death of his brother at 18, my parents death and his wife Diana's death a year and a half ago from Covid-19. After her death Jeff decided to retire and move back to our city to be closer to his parents.

 A couple of months ago his son JJ (my godson) had a homecoming dance and he and his friends decided to rent a limo, everyone met up at a park to take pictures and we met JJ's date, a sweet and beautiful girl named Jessica but her mother Alexis was very rude and standoffish. I noticed Jeff looked a little pale and teary-eyed but I just figured he was upset his wife wasn't there. 

After the pictures finished Jeff and I stayed there and talked while his younger kids played at the playground. I asked him if he was ok, and he said he had messed up. He made me promise not to tell anyone that 18 years ago when he had come home alone for his brother's funeral he had a one night stand with Alexis (Diana couldn't come because she was too pregnant to fly) and she had called him some weeks later to say she was pregnant but he had just called her a liar and blocked her number. He was freaked out that his son could be dating his sister. I told him he really needed to talk to Alexis. Surprisingly Alexis herself called him after getting his number from Jessica. She agreed to come back to the park and talk. I took Jeff's kids to McDonald's for their privacy. When Jeff came to pick them up he said they were getting a DNA test first then would tell the kids. 

Flash forward a few weeks later Jeff's mother has a FB post about a long lost granddaughter with Jessica's picture. There was a long story to it but I didn't read it because I had already heard the story and she wrote it in ALL CAPS which drives me crazy.

 Today JJ came over to pick up some pies I had made for Thanksgiving and mentioned Jessica was going to be there and he was happy they found out they were related before they had a Jon Snow and Daenyrs situation. I said no it would be more like Jaime and Ceresi since they were also brother and sister. He starts freaking out and saying that she was his cousin and called his dad. Turns out Alexis and Jeff told everyone that Jeff's dead brother was the father and they did a grandparents DNA test, which came back positive. Jeff didn't want anyone to know he had cheated on his then pregnant and now deceased wife. So now everyone knows what really happened.

At first I thought that this was related to a recent indicent in which I had my laptop stolen while I looked away, in the end I can get easily distracted (no, I do not have ADHD). However she kept talking and told me the reason was because a year ago I went on a trip and in the plane lost a hand made bracelet she had given me. For her it was representative of that red thread of destiny copypasta, for me  it represented the amount of compromise she was willing to have with our relationship. 

Fast forward a year and a half later she tells me this. I hadn't realized that she has not given me anything else after that because I'm not a materialistic person nor would I expect her to give me a gift. What upsets me is the fact that she was keeping this for so long and when she finally opens up I am on my way up from one of the biggest emotional downfalls I've had, she knows this, and the last thing that I needed was having the feeling that I now have to prove myself to her.

She did not intended to hurt me, however she did and all this questions started popping up in my head. How could she trust me anything then? Does she think that I am incapable of being responsible of something? Does she believe I could be responsible with our relationship? Has she seriously doubted me over this whole time for just one bracelet of some copypasta? 

This of course was a very deep cut for me. Trying to avoid myself from saying something out of place or hurtful I told her I had to think for the night what I thought, she quickly realized what she had said had hurted me and told me she didn't want to end the night on a wrong note. I just told her that I wanted to think about how I felt. She sat there with a poignant look on her face while I ended the call. Her expression touches me even deeper.

If not, ignore this. I'm Karen (f42), and I'm a mom married to my husband of 16 years. Fun fact: I strategically birthed one child each year from 2010-2017. I come from a big family, so I feel most at home with a lot of people. Other than them, we have a teen daughter Narniah (f14). I would've tried to start my streak of one new offspring each year in 2007 (her birth year), but I had a rough first pregnancy and wanted a couple off years before going regular with it.

This post will focus on Narniah. She just entered high school, and naturally there’s peer pressure to do bad things. When she told me 2 months ago that she made a TikTok account, I was mortified and deleted it immediately. I’d heard from a few friends previously that TikTok is a nefarious adult app that lures kids. I'll admit that my friend group isn’t the most up-to-date on current issues like new social medias.

I did my research after that and realized that TikTok is supposed to be suitable for 13+. However, I didn't want Narniah thinking she got freedom to do things she shouldn't because we already discussed that she can't have TikTok until she is 18, so I kept the no TikTok rule. Just a couple weeks ago, however, I looked through her phone and noticed TikTok downloaded! I opened the app, and the first video that popped up was adult actress/actor Jojosiwa showing her/his bare chest. This was appalling to me. I don't know what gender Jojo is because of the conflicting anatomy my poor eyes saw, but that girl on Dance Moms shouldn’t do that. For her to expose herself like that REALLY proves that this is NOT appropriate.

When Narniah came back home from school that day, we had a conversation about her TikTok usage. She started crying and said she’s not trying to be rebellious and just wants to interact with her friends. NOT rebellious for going against her parents' backs? If you don't follow rules, don't feel remorse, and don't feel the effects, you're a vicious rebel here. I pushed that TikTok has intense adult content and there are unclothed bodies in nearly every suggested post. That's a lie, but I needed to get my point across effectively.

Narniah continued to talk back. She brought up how I use OnlyFans and am a ‘bad influence’ on her. Am I really? Let me explain why I started using OF and how I use it responsibly. With the whole Meta takeover and Elon or whatever, my friend group decided to shift away from Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. My sister selected OnlyFans as a new connection network because you don't have to see anything from people you don't want to. I never use OF in an 18+ manner and don't intend to either. I'm actually worried about why my daughter knows that people use it for sensual work. I really hope she just stays off of her phone now that I've set her age back 10 years on all accounts.

I (17m) and my brother (10m) have refused to go to my little sisters Christmas party, despite my mother pressuring us to go. 

My brother and i both have autism which makes it incredibly hard to socialise. My mum knows this and is normally very respectful of it. 

My little sister has a Christmas concert on tonight for her kindergarten. Neither of us want to go, mainly due to not feeling up for socialising tonight, especially with people we dont know. When mum bought this up with both me and my brother, she got really pissed off when we said we weren't going. She can't exactly make me go, since we've both agreed in old enough to do what I want, but shes spent all night explaining how I've disappointed both her and my sister, (despite my sister not really caring when I asked her.)

Now my brother can't handle pressure very well, and my mum knows this. All night she's been bringing the topic up to him, saying how he doesn't have a choice. When I told her that it was kinda messed up to force a socially anxious autistic kid to go to a concert, she instead started guilting him. Saying things like ""you'll make your sister so sad"" and ""I can't believe how selfish you're acting."" This got my brother pretty stressed out, to the point where he started crying. At that point my mum realised it was useless to get him to go. Instead, she banned him from using the switch (practically his only way to release stress) and grounded him to his room. 

She Left shortly after, leaving my brother screaming into his pillow from the mental stress. I genuinely don't know what to think. She's always been very kind and respectful of both of us, and always asked us our boundaries. I know it's messed up to guilt trip a child into crying, all because they won't go to a concert, but at the same time I don't know if I'm being selfish by not going, and supporting my brother in his choice to stay home as well.

Let’s call him Blake for different reasons. So Blake is autistic and he’s never worked a customer service job before. No biggie, that’s just his experience. Our first couple of shifts together went smooth no sign of complications or rough patches. However on the 3rd day of us training , we are doing a training segment on a IPad, and I can see that he’s not taking his time on the training,(What’s supposed to take him an hour took 5 minutes) after he handed the IPad back to me I asked him about the material within the training, and when he couldn’t get the answers right he stormed off. He came back shortly and I was able to calm him down however when we proceeded the training on the IPad , he put the IPad down and said “I quit.” I was able to calm him down again, and got my managers attention, and we all talked about it and it seemed like he was done working there. However when we were walking him out he sits down suddenly and says nope I’m going to stay. There my manger tells him that what he did wasn’t okay and that if it were to happen again he would be fired . I continue on with the training and every day for a week and a half there is melt down after melt down, I try and ask what is the matter and ask him to communicate if there is absolutely anything I can do to make this better for him. And every time I was waived off like I didn’t matter . So eventually it’s gets bad enough to where I have to call my manager and make her aware of the situation . From that point my manger Blake and I sit down and come up with a training segment that would be best suited for him. The very next day after changing the training multiple times , he comes in expects to do whatever he wants . And when I correct him that what he was doing wasn’t okay. He storms off on me again. Now here’s why I might be the asshole. As I mentioned earlier there was a lot of breakdowns but my manger told me that after every breakdown(Atleast one a shift )I have to sit down with him and  explain to him that what he did wasn’t okay why it wasn’t okay and ask how can we prevent this from happening. I do understand autism and that it is different with every single person, so that’s why I understand these post meltdown conversations may seem like they are confrontational. however it was communicated to me and expected of him that no matter his condition he should be able to do the training and work like everyone else. And now fast forward to today, we were on our final training segments for the I pad and when I can see that he wasn’t taking his time again on the material I don’t say anything however when I try and move on with a discussion based role, he didn’t like that I was correcting him and clocked out.

She has always struggled showing her emotions, and I thought I was prepared for this going in. 

I was her MOH and basically put my heart and soul into her wedding. She was also moving house just a few weeks after, right when she got back from the honeymoon so she had a lot going on. I wanted to do as much as possible to take the stress off. I can’t tell you everything I did because this would be a literal novel, but basically I was there for her physically and emotionally for about 3 months prior to the wedding. Doing everything I could to help and anything she needed. 

I started to really struggle with the fact that she would never say thank you, but I told myself “it’s just her, you know she appreciates it.” But as time went on and I did more and more for her, the more it got in my head, did she appreciate it? Was I just in the way or was I actually helping? I really would’ve appreciated some sort of feedback.

The real problem came when she got the photos back and posted on Instagram. Now I don’t use Instagram really but I knew if there was going to be a thank you it would be something super impersonal, like an Insta post… and it was. Only it didn’t include me. She posted some of the photos with a caption something like “thank you so much to everyone who came, and a special thanks to…” I was excited to read on.. only the special thanks did not include me. I was honestly heartbroken. Why were there people she barely knows and doesn’t like in there but not me? 

I brought it up to her in a lighthearted way and she basically said “general thanks were at the top”, implying that I was just a part of the general thank you like the wedding guests and not worthy of a mention. This wouldn’t bother me if she had thanked me at any point during any of the time I was doing everything for her. So I pushed it and we ended up in a massive argument, she said I shouldn’t have done it if I wanted something for it.. but I didn’t want anything, literally just acknowledgement. She said I’d made her feel so shit and it wasn’t worth the stupid wedding and she regretted it. She made me feel like I ruined her wedding. 

I really didn’t do any of this for anything, I just think it’s reasonable to receive a thank you or some kind of acknowledgment when you do so much for someone?

We are all made up now, but it’s really been playing on my mind. AITA for wanting some kind of feedback for the hard work I was doing? I really don’t think I was doing it for anything in return but does wanting a little bit of appreciation mean I’m selfish? I’ve really been second guessing myself, please help me out xxx 

P.S. I would do it again and 100 times over for her in a heartbeat, even knowing she wouldn’t so much as say thank you because I love her so much.

In March ‘20, I found out from his profile, that they had yet another baby, and at that point I had had 8 miscarriages, and was at a point of breaking down, so I unfriended him aswell (didn’t even know we were friends). My world was crashing. But at the end of ‘20, I got help, and immediately got better. In ‘21 I had yet another miscarriage, but this time I had a blessing aswell. I got pregnant and it stuck. But in August that year, when I was 8 weeks along, I found out that this couple, yet again, HAD ANOTHER CHILD. He worked from home, so she had three under 3, and I could feel it in my soul, that something was going to happen.
Now… in December last year, her youngest passed away. She initially told people, that it was heart failure, because the child had a condition. Not even a week later, her family, told the world what actually happened. She was visiting her mother, with her three kids. The youngest one fell asleep in the car, so she only took the older two with her inside. After about half an hour, she went to chech on the still three month old child, who she found, wasn’t breathing. She tried CPR, and had to rush to the hospital, about 15 mins away. In the hospital, her child was announced dead.
The thing is, I just don’t feel sorry for the mother. I have had a few pregnancy losses, and know I should feel something, but I can’t for the life of me, feel anything. I feel sorry for the child, but that’s it. If I had a child, with a heart condition, I sure as H wouldn’t leave it outside in the car. It’s literally neglect. And because of that, I can’t ever speak to her again. In my eyes, she literally left her child in the car to die. On the other hand, it has made me more careful with my son, who’s now 7 months old.

Hey all, long-time listener, first-time caller. Using a throwaway because some of my co-workers know my Reddit handle.

I work in the transportation industry, specifically as a yard truck driver/guardshack operator for a very large logistics company (we do over $2,000,0pa00 in freight a night at my site). This means my co-workers and I direct trucker traffic, move trailers, seal and check seals, and ensure smooth yard operations.

With Christmas coming up, our volume has increased tenfold. I frequently end up staying late and picking up extra shifts because 'no one else can cover'. It's decent money, but I'm starting to get burned out.

One important thing to know is that everyone here smokes. I mean \*everyone\*, all the way up to our regional manager. It's well-known that everyone will take a smoke break basically whenever they want, and normally I don't care. I get it, it's a real addiction.

But here's where I might be the AH. Today at work I was the only one in a hostler, and the move orders were piling up. I was going as fast as I (safely) could, but was falling horribly behind. Meanwhile, my manager and the other employees were all smoking behind the guardshack. Two hostlers were idling as their drivers were smoking.

After a while of me doing moves, I got mad that no one else was helping. In a fit of rage, I turned on my radio and said something like ""No one is helping with these fucking moves, and the queue is out of control. Get off your a\*\*es and be fucking chimneys after the moves are done, you dumbshit cock-gobblers.""

Normally our radio frequency is only for our transportation team, and if you've ever worked in transportation what I said is considered to be pretty tame. But at the moment, one of the folks inside just happened to be on our channel and heard my callout. He immediately complained to HR and I got called in to a meeting.

Long story short, I was dismissed early even though I was the only one working, which I still think is stupid. One of my buddies who isn't suspended told me that the queue is eternally backed-up - turns out I'm the only one there who was making anything close to quota lol. But now he's telling me they are having to take sensitivity trainings, and I am worried that I am going to lose my job. I have been kicked out of all the work group chats and unfriended by most of the employees.

The problem is he doesn't care about his grades and his life is a complete mess. I've tried years back to back helping him out in any way but it just doesn't work. I wish this was just about school but it's not. As of lately he's been hanging out with the wrong crowd and it's been affecting him and my parent's household.

Ever since he started hanging out with his new friends he's been smoking weed,ditching school, not doing his class work, leaving the house at literally 10 pm to come back around 12 or 3 a.m. One day his friend's house got shot at and this brilliant kid decided to run all the way to his friends to try to confront the people. They ended up chasing back all the way towards our block and then guess what? One day he was walking back home around 11pm and some random people tried jumping him our neighbors ended up stepping in a saving my little brother and you'd think that after that he'd learn but no, he goes out regardless of the time. Even when we had a serial killer on the lose but ooh it gets worse, one day he was with his friend and his friend had a problem with a guy my little brother ends up getting involved and he gets a gun pointed at him. NOW YOU'D THINK HE'D LEARN but he doesn't ladies and gentlemen he still hangs out with the wrong people. I've told him multiple times that he's going to end up getting shot,killed or putting our family in problems he's soo stubborn and ignorant that he can't see the consequences of his actions. All this time I've done his homework, woke up late to pick him up from some random place, stood up for him, devoted my entire sanity and time on him. 

Finally I told myself maybe I'll just sit down and have meaningful conversation and that's it if it doesn't work I'm done worrying and im done caring. He said ""yeah I'm going to get my stuff together"" but guess what he still goes out comes back home stinking of Marijuana he's absolutely addicted to it. So I just said fuck it and now debating if it's wrong that I'd give up on him. Oh and yeah my parents have tried talking to him we've tried therapy we've also given him space and time but nope nothing has worked it's just someone that doesn't want help as my grandfather would say.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4817613,public,top,self,AITA for/about to give up on my sibling and just move on with life?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2ixjn/aita_forabout_to_give_up_on_my_sibling_and_just/,all_ads,6,,,,,,
