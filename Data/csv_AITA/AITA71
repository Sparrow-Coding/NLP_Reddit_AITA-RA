My roommate has a cat and we are all on lease together. I am allergic to her cat. The cat is allowed by the landlord but is making me miserable.

I can't enjoy any common areas of the house because of my allergies. I feel this is really unfair. The cat keeps me up all night by meowing outside my door all night and scratching at it. Sometimes the cat will sneak into my room and it sets off my allergies. The cat jumps up on the counters and the cabinets and the cat scratches up the furniture. The cat slams the lower cabinet doors at all hours. My roommate who I'll call Kim won't keep the cat in her room at night (in my opinion the bare minimum so I can sleep) because she says the cat keeps HER up at night. I have brought up these issues to Kim and she won't listen she refuses to do anything about it. Kim will just get mad at me for bringing it up.(she says I'm attacking her if I do) Last time I asked her about it she yelled in my face that she won't do anything about it. I have been trying to avoid the subject for a while but I'm getting sick of if.

I have serious allergies and have been hospitalized in the past because of it. My s/o also doesn't like the way Kim handles the situation and is very concerned about my health. Kim refuses to do anything on her part. If the cabinet slamming bothers her she feeds the cat so the cat keeps doing it. She refuses to get child safety locks for the cabinets or clean up after her cat. Her cats fur is on all the furniture and the cats toys are all over the main areas. Kim has decorated the entire common area herself. Including her desk (takes up a lot of space). The only things of ours in the common areas are a poster my s/o put up, and a small picture.

I'm not sure what to do I thought about seeing if the landlord could do anything but I am unsure since the cat is on the lease. I feel trapped in my own house. The only cat free space is my room but the cat sometimes sneaks in which is a big problem because of my allergies. I feel this is unfair and Kim is a total AH. The cat has done some damage to the house to tired of typing to get into details it's not a lot but enough for me to worry about my safety deposit. Is there anything I can do about my situation? Kim thinks I am the AH because I shoo her cat off the counters and cabinets or away from furniture when the cat is trying to scratch it. Am I over reacting? I don't feel like I am but I think I may be the AH based on Kim's reactions. I know cats are hard to train but I still think something could be done. I don't blame the cat.

I used to date this guy a while back, we're both teenagers who are in the same class. I broke up with him about a month ago since I realized I'm not ready for a relationship. I told him that we should be just friends, as I think we'll get comfortable with eachother that way. He agreed to it, and things seemed to be going pretty good for a while.
The thing is, he started being mean to me ""as a joke"". I am a naturally sensitive person who gets her feelings hurt easily, but giving him benefit of the doubt I ignored the jokes. Sometimes when I was really hurt, I used to call him out for it, and he used to apologize as well (mind you, I never make hurtful jokes about him).
 Yesterday, out of the blue he told me to k1ll myself.
I was very obviously hurt. I asked him over text whether he was mad at me, and he denied this. Today, he told me that I'm too soft and that ""he's treating me like a friend"", and that if i dont like it I should stop talking to him.
Am I overreacting? Because I know I'm sensitive, but I don't see why me getting mad over this is irrational.

TL;DR- My very close friend (who I used to date a while back) told me yesterday to k1ll myself for no reason. I got mad at him.

My daughter (12f) is the type of person who is nice and kind to everyone regardless of whoever they are, and she even sometimes helps the kids who used to make fun of her. She doesn't really like all the attention but is genuinely happy to be around with her social circle. There is a girl whom my daughter is friends with, whom we'll call Maddie (fake name).

Maddie is always clinging to my daughter, calling her for stupid reasons, disturbing her while she's studying, always asking for favors etc. So today, my daughter went out to get printouts for her project, which is due tomorrow. It is exam season in my country right now, so exams will start in less than 3 weeks. But due to the project, my daughter was unable to study as she spent all her time in the project.

While she was out getting printouts, she lost her cycle's lock keys. Without the lock, the cycle might get stolen. The cycle is also expensive. This is the second time she lost the keys. First time, we found it but we searched the second time she lost the keys and couldn't find it. Also, she didn't get any punishment because we never ground her at all. She only got a minor setback which was no snacks for a day. (She eats A LOT of snacks before dinner).

Right after we came back, Maddie messages my daughter and asks my daughter to bring her printouts. I don't think this is relevant but my husband works out of country so me and my daughter live alone, while Maddie lives with both of her parents. My daughter was ready to help her but I denied it. She was visibly upset at this. She was mad and stomped inside her room. I told her that she was not a doormat who should be stepped on, and one of Maddie's parents can get a printout if she can't. Also since she had lost the keys, she couldn't use the cycle. She even offered to compromise and walk instead but I denied as the stationery shop is along one of the main roads.

My daughter did not talk to me for a while at this. She eventually accepted it but I feel like she's still mad.

After the breakup we kept meeting up, hanging out trying to be friends . Most Off the times it endes up with us either having sex or crying to each other. 

My mental health didn’t handle the breakup well and I ended up in the hospital one night. Because of other health issues they decided to run some tests while I already was there. Some days later they called me asking if I knew that I was pregnant. I was in shook. Two years ago I got told that the chances of me ever having my own children are very low maybe not even there at all. I told the hospital it has to be a miss understanding and that I would like them to check again. So I went in and they took new tests and I was in fact pregnant.

I told my ex “I have something to tell you and your not gonna be happy” he immediately understood what was happening and got really stressed. He told me that If I choose to have the baby I will “ruin his life” and that his life “doesn’t mater anymore” if I don’t take and abortion. 

I have told people that are closer to him than me that I’m scared for his safety so they’re keeping an eye on him. And I have also said he doesn’t need to have anything to do with me or the baby but he says that doesn’t help. 

I don’t know if I want the child. Or like I want it but my ex means a lot to me and I don’t want to hurt him 

The other day he told me straight to my face “I wish I never got to know you” and I still slept at his place that night because I knew how bad he was doing and scared he would hurt himself.

We have known each other a bit longer (13 months).  Without going into too much detail, he was coming out of a severe depressive episode when we met and alcohol was clearly a crutch/symptom of that so I always knew he was “fond of a drink” but I’ve noticed a few patterns in his drinking. 

1. He can never just have “a drink”. He always has to get drunk. 
2. His measures are INSANE. I’m talking a pint glass filled almost half with alcohol. 
3. He often “goes to sleep” if he’s out drinking with others. He blames this on the speed he drinks rather than how much. 
4. He can rarely be in a social setting without a drink. Example: we recently went to a friends house to watch movies. he ended up going through a bottle of their gin (he was the only one drinking. we didn’t bring alcohol with us) we ended up leaving early because he was getting rude with our friend, spilled a glass of gin and mixer on her new carpet and said it was the dogs fault for knocking it over because it was on the carpet - he was asked by both me and her to put it on the shelves next to him but for some reason he didn’t. 

I tried to talk to him about how he embarrassed me in front of our friend and how he was disrespectful to her house but he just had an excuse or an answer for everything. I mentioned how I don’t like him sometimes when he drinks because he can sometimes be a knob 

5. he can WFH some days if he chooses. I came home from work a few days ago to find he’d had “two beers” whilst being at work. I asked him if he thought that was a wise idea and he said “It’s not like I have a camera on me”

A few weeks ago he went out. He wound up getting into a situation that his (19) year old nephew “dared him to do” that ended up with him being rescued by fire, police and ambulance services and then calling out of work the next day. 

Fast forward to last night. I had two drinks and he had about 3 rums then switched to beer. It was getting late so I went to bed and told him to not stay up too late. He said he’d be finishing the beer he had, then he’d be coming to bed too. 

I woke up this morning and he’s asleep on the couch, surrounded by 5 cans - one being half empty behind his head on the sofa. I saw another 5/6 empty cans on the bench. When I asked him why he didn’t come to bed he said he “didn’t want to disturb the dogs and cause them to bark so he just stayed on the sofa”.  I said he clearly passed out (as he has before)  because all the lights, Xbox/tv were still on and there was a half drunk can behind him. 

He again said he just fell asleep and at this point I sort of lost my temper. I said he clearly has issues with alcohol and he needs to accept that and maybe work toward getting some help. Drinking is a culture in his family as his dad likes a good drink and his brother is a recovering alcoholic. 

He just turned around and left the house.

A table of four , we were seated for lunch and promptly ordered our food.

One thing to note is that my partners mother Sarah is pescatarian by religion (Middle eastern)

We ordered our food, I got a english muffin which was delicous and my partner orderd a bento bowl which was also very nice. Sarah see's the Okonomiyaki with smoked salmon which also sounded really good.

We all recieve our food and began eating it. Halfway through eating i get offered to try some of the Okonomiyaki which i obviously accept as i love trying new foods. Upon eating it i realise that there is bacon in the dish ( i eat bacon all the time so i know what it taste like) and knowing that Sarah is pescatarian i immediately let her know. She is visibly upset with this so We check the menu and the  description of the dish, Now there is a big list of ingredients detailing what goes in an Okonomiyaki however bacon is not listed as one of them!

We call over a waitress and explain the situation , The waitress gives us a very scripted "" Well traditional okonomiyaki contains bacon"" Implying that we should of known;No apology was given

Sarah says she doesnt want the dish anymore so the waitress takes it away without apologising or offering us another dish. We then ask to speak to the owner who is also present at the time and we also explain the situation and once again we get the "" Well traditional okonomiyaki contains bacon"" story (which makes me think that if both of them immediately know what to say then this has happened before). He tries to explain to us what traditional okonomiyaki contains and once again doesnt offer us another dish in replacement (Sarah is a slow eater so she had only eaten about a quater of her meal and was still hungry)

Even though i understand that traditional okonomiyaki may contains bacon , you can't expect customers to know that , especially if you dont say it on the menu. Once we got home and i told my family about this , and said that i had left a 1 star review on their google page and posted to their facebook about my experience. My father blows up at me saying that it's his favourite cafe and that me posting my experience will ruin their reputation as its a small community and could potentially ruin the business; That they comped us for the dish and apologied and that should've been enough!

I (F 28) and my fiancé (M 29) have been engaged for nearly 2 years. My fiancé’s brother (C) got engaged to his long term girlfriend (E) about a year before us. 

Background:
My fiancé and his brother were quite close growing up however have grown apart quite a bit in the last 5 or so years because C moved interstate for work. They are still on good terms but mostly only speak on birthdays and holidays now. C and E have been together since high school and so E has spent a lot of time with my fiancé and his family, but has never been particularly close with them and E does not see any of my fiancé’s family when they come back to our state to visit. I should also add that I met my fiancé after C and E moved away so I have only met C a few times and E once briefly.

C and E recently got married and about 6 months ago my fiancé received an invitation stating that he was not given a plus one. My fiancé’s two sisters also received invitations with no plus one’s, however they are both in new relationships so we’re fine with this. My fiancé was very upset by this because we have been in a serious relationship for 4 years now and I am considered to be part of the family by everyone else. 

I was definitely upset but I completely understand that weddings can be expensive and inviting people you don’t know well is not always feasible, so was fine to let it go.  My fiancé was not ok with this a called C to say that if I couldn’t attend C and E’s wedding then E would not be invited to our wedding. C immediately said it was fine for my fiancé to bring me to the wedding, and so I did end up attending.

The wedding was lovely up until the speeches, E stood up and did a speech thanking all my fiancé’s family for attending, naming each one. Instead of just skipping over me, she looked at me and thanked “the girl [my fiancé] brought along” and that she was sorry but she had forgotten my name. I was mortified and my fiancé was furious.

After the speeches were over, C came over to apologise and said that E was very drunk and didn’t know what she was saying. My fiancé is still angry, and his family all agree that E was out of line, however I feel like I might have been the asshole for attending the wedding even though it was clear that I was not wanted there from the start.

Not just me but my entire family. The reason is simple: We helped her out and even let her stay at our house for months rent-free when she had some issues, but she badmouthed us to our entire extended family and spread some rumours that weren’t true at all. It has fortunately been resolved but our relationship is still strained.

Last week, there was a fight. A really big fight that was escalated to the point where most of our extended family got involved. It was ridiculous and about a post made by some relative, which badmouthed my grandfather, and he tagged my mother in the post. Obviously my mom had nothing to do with the post, as she had a very good relationship with our grandfather before he passed away. However, most of our relatives are quite old and don’t know how the tagging in posts work, and thought that she also agreed with him, and attacked her for badmouthing her own father. This issue was raised the most by that aunt, and she kept attacking my mom, saying things like my mom not coming back to our home country sooner was the reason why my grandfather passed away(???? he was 70+ and had stage 4 cancer did she honestly think he would survive even with my mother there), and kept bringing up things from the past. 

Now this is the part where I may be the AH. Her daughter had eloped with her boyfriend that my aunt disapproved of, her son ran away because he could not handle the academic pressure that she placed on him, and her husband left her because she was too controlling and manipulative. I said something along the lines of “Well if you’re such a family person then I wonder why your entire family left you.” She was SEETHING. My mother appreciates that I tried to stand up for her, but I should not have dropped to her level. The extended family is on my aunt’s side, saying I hurt her feelings.

We wanted to share our blessings by helping our family members. We would bring to Canada one of the adults and help them get through school, find a job and provide for them until they can stand on their own two feet and then they would bring their own families. One family didnt get along well with us due to a sibling rivalry between the our parents…but my cousin’s mother begged for us to bring our cousin here so she could have a chance in life as they couldn’t afford anything back home anymore, both parents cant find a job,her brother has mental disabilities, their close to losing their home, and they barely eat. We felt bad so we helped their family.

Everything was going great until she started meeting new friends. She started sneaking out at night when she knows everyones asleep. Because of this my mom moved her to my place, which is ok with me since i have a few extra rooms at my house. My mom thought she would feel embarrassed of sneaking out because theres a camera. This didnt stop her at all…she would come home too drunk too many times and one time my bf, when he came home from a night shift, saw that she was almost lying down on our porch…the worse was when she snuck out and my sister who was with her bf at a bar next door saw her drunk af at a club….my sister said she kept trying to take her home but she was pushing my sis away and guys were trying to get her back that my sister’s bf had to fight them off….in the end she passed out and they drove her to my parents house where my mom caught them at 4 am. She was blacked out drunk and vomited allover my sisters car and bf, they had to carry her in
My mom got so pissed off she warned my cousin that if she does this one more time she will be sent back to our home country…..but when things cooled down we tried talking to her to understand if theres any problem or what, we even suggested therapy and let her know were always here for her and the reason why my mom got mad is because she was worried….she understood and was sorry about the mess

My parents moved out of this country five years ago (yes, I was 18.) It is not the USA.

My mom and I have always had a bit of a complicated relationship, but I get along with my dad just fine. 

This year we're celebrating Christmas at their house, so we're flying out to see them in a few weeks. Ever since we bought the plane tickets, my mom has been bombarding me with things she wants me to arrange, bring, buy, sign... 

I understand, she doesn't live here and some things are hard to arrange from afar. And she misses some food and household items. I can still understand that kind of situation. 

But it's been like this all the time, for 5 years. I still have to do something for her.

When she was selling some of her paintings here in our country, I was going to the printer and dealing with the printing data. When she had flight problems and couldn't book it online, I called the airline (not once, but maybe 6 times.) When she needed to pick up a package and hand it off to someone else, I did it. This is just a small sampling of things that have come to mind. 

My dad has never asked me for anything in the time they've been gone. Sometimes I feel like I'm her parent and she's the kid who can't do anything on her own. I take it that one must be responsible for the consequences when chooses to live in another country.

And now is the point where I don't know if I should set some boundaries with my mom or if I'm an asshole because she had done so much for me – especially earlier in my childhood. Should I appreciate it and do it without complaining or set boundaries with her?

Every year since being a manager I have done the same thing for my team at Christmas. I have bought using my own money a Christmas card and inside out 2 scratch cards. 

I have always  gifted because it's easy, bit of fun and not too personal  I'm buying for 40-50 people and writing the cards takes a few hours nevermind buying the gifts. 

Now I have one guy on my team called Dave, Dave has being going through a hard time and he spent some time off with depression. When he returned to work he mentioned that he had quit betting  as it had ""got a bit out of hand when I was at home all day"". I offered him more support but he said he had sorted it and we haven't discussed it since. As Dave's been struggling I but have regularly taken him for walking  attendance meeting ( where we basically go for a walk while discussing his performance) and I made a special effort to make sure 

When it came to buying Christmas cards/ present I asked Dave if he wanted scratch cards or something different. I was concerned that it could be triggering especially if he won something. Dave asked for something else and just said surprise me. 

I decided it would be nice to make a date night box for him and his wife. I got him 2 cinema tickets and a box of goodies. All-in it cost about £20 double the cost of the 2 scratch cards. 

I gave everyone their little gift at the start of a meeting. Someone asked why Dave's was different and I panicked a bit as I didn't want to tell everyone his business so said "" I was chatting with Dave the other day and he said he would prefer something different"". 

My team has a few moaners so they were moaning why they didn't get the option of something different and they would have appreciated a date night box instead of scratch card that didn't win, no one had asked them their preference ect. 

I tried to move the meeting on but they just wouldn't stop moaning about how it's unfair that Dave got something worth loads more.

 In the end I very sternly reminded the team I bought this out my personal money and it was not a work present and I was really disappointed with some of their responses. 

I got feedback from one of the other managers  that I was an ass hole for treating ine differently, I explained to them why they explained they understood but if I do it for one I should do it for everyone.

Wife and I are both 28. We started dating at 18. Her family,was rich. I was not. A year into dating my family got into a lot of financial troubles and dept because of my parent's poor choices and my gf made sure my needs are at least met. She always gifted me new stuff like clothes or gaming stuff that I wanted and I couldn't afford. She always treated me out on dates and didn't expect me to pay since I was in a bad financial situation. She had lots of money so treating me was no burden to her. Her parents always supported her financially and supported her career beginnings but for a number of horrible reason she no longer speaks to any of these people. So since they went nc my wife is on her own financially. Eventually I got a high paying job as did my wife and we lived comfortably. We're not filthy rich but we're not a step away from poverty either.

She recently lost her job. Her company went bankrupt and she received no compensation for all her years of work because of it. 

She was already struggling with a lot of bad stuff that has happened to her recently and her losing her job was the nail in the coffin. She's fallen into deep depression and her therapist gave her some strong medication which is not working.

Because we've lost one income in the house I decided to cut down on the costs. Since she lost her job I haven't offered to pay for something she likes and she can't get, haven't offered to take her on dates because I believed there's no reason to burden ourselves financially since she can't contribute as of now. I genuinely believed I did it for our own good and for financial responsibility. Even with my income we are still very much comfortable I just didn't want her to get too comfortable with the idea of me contributing everything while she does nothing and that's why I didn't offer anything more.

Last night some friends visited and saw the state my wife is in. She locked herself in the room and barely spoke to anyone. I explained the situation to them in detail. They asked if I've done anything to make her feel better. I said I can't do much. They then understood from my words how we haven't been on dates since she lost her job and how I don't offer to do stuff for her and claimed I'm an imbecile for that and that I should be ashamed to do that in the name of responsibility and that its like I'm punishing her rather than being financially responsible. They told me to get it together and stop being selfish and they reminded me how during my hardest times my wife was practically my sugar mama and now I refuse to do stuff for her and I'm the one being ungrateful and in the wrong.

Maybe indeed it was bad judgement. I wanted to be financially responsible and not make her think that she can just not make effort anymore to get a new job. Maybe it was a wrong call, maybe not. Idk.

The cat also keeps me up all night by meowing outside my door all night and scratching at it. Sometimes the cat will sneak into my room and it sets off my allergies. The cat also jumps up on the counters and the cabinets and I have refused to get any new or nicer furniture for the living room (the cat just scratches up the furniture). The cat also slams the lower cabinet doors at all hours of the day and night. My roommate who I'll call Kim won't keep the cat in her room at night (in my opinion the bare minimum so I can sleep) because she says the cat keeps HER up at night. I have brought up these issues to Kim and she won't listen she refuses to do anything about it. Kim will just get mad at me for bringing it up even calmly.(she says I'm attacking her if I do) Last time I asked her about it she yelled in my face that she won't do anything about it. I have been trying to avoid the subject for a while but I'm getting sick of if. I have serious allergies and have been hospitalized in the past because of it. My s/o also doesn't like the way Kim handles the situation and is very concerned about my health. Kim refuses to do anything on her part. If the cabinet slamming bothers her she feeds the cat so the cat keeps doing it. She refuses to get child safety locks for the cabinets or clean up after her cat.

The only things of ours in the common areas are a poster my s/o put up, and a small picture. We also each have a futon in the living room the cat scratches both. I'm not sure what to do I thought about seeing if the landlord could do anything but I am unsure since the cat is on the lease. I feel trapped in my own house. The only cat free space is my room but the cat sometimes sneaks in which is a big problem because of my allergies. I feel this is unfair and Kim is a total AH. Is there a way to legally do something? I live in Wisconsin if that's important. We are all on the lease. The cat has done some damage to the house to tired of typing to get into details it's not a lot but enough for me to worry about my safety deposit. Is there anything I can do about my situation?

I met her in a a BBQ dinner at their house ...
And we kinda got a spark between us ...we had so many things in common and we hit it up since ...
Even tho I loved her ...She was kinda too much attached ...too clingy..
She wanted to see me everyday even tho we go to different collages...which I kinda understood since she clearly loved me so much which is a somthing to appreciate...
She started talking about marriage not even 2 months into the relationship..I mean yes at around the 18 months mark we were planning on it..but at 2 months that sounded weird...
A year into our relationship...She started to convince me about having a baby and ofcourse I refused because we were both in collage ...
Around two weeks short of our 2 years mark I realized that she poked holes in my condom ...
I buy my owns condoms ...but in two consecutive times she refused to let me use my own and gave me a one she brought ...which made me realize something isn't right...
Also she lied about being on pill because later I found the package that I bought her eariler still closed and I know she didn't get any because nobody has ever bought her pills besides me for over six months..
I was absolutely furious with her ..I yelled at her and thank God I held my myself from touching her (I can be kinda short tempered sometimes) 
I drove her to her parents house ( we were in my apartment ) and explained that I want nothing with her anymore after what she did ...weirdly enough her mom sided with her daughter and she was angry at me because apparently it is my fault that we were taking our time with the marriage and the having kids ..that situation kinda gave me conspiracy theory vibes
...
I yelled at her mother some more and things kinda got heated ...I then relized that there is nothing for me to gain ...and I went home...
next day my mom told me that she will never talk to Me unless I go and apologize for my behavior...which kinda shocked me ... she also gave me the ""you took your time with the relationship"" excuse..which made me more angry than before ...
she told me that If I want to ditch her that is OK..but I should apologize to her and to her mother about how I yelled at them and apparently my girlfriend told her mother that I hit her but I absolutely did not lay a hand on her

I (F21) am supposed to take a flight on Christmas to go see my long distance ""boyfriend"" (23M) for the first time. I'm saying ""boyfriend"" as we are not official, but we've been in a relationshipy type of situation for the past 4 months. We have talked about it and made plans for the past 2 months and we have everything settled.

However, I've been seeing some serious issues in his behavior. He's the mysterious and relaxed type of guy, but the reason we have not made it official yet is because we were waiting to meet each other in person and see if we really have that same connection as we do now. He has told me that he had commitment issues in the past, but really feels a connection like never before with me and does not want to run away from it as it could be a good lasting relationship, so he is working on his issues.

About 2 weeks ago, we had a long conversation about how he feels like I'm trying to make him jealous and get upset when he doesn't react to it. I listened to what he had to say and realized that I have made some unconscious mistakes that I haven't made since, apologized and rectified my behavior. Ever since, I have noticed that the both of us became more possessive, but not a bad way, thing to which he mentioned makes him feel even more invested in us.

Last night, he asked me something regarding my past relationships. As we are open and communicate well, when he has a question like this I'm not hesitant to answer as I have nothing to hide. After we talked about his question, he says that he feels like after every relationship you leave a part of you with that person, and was doubtful on how I would react if any of those parts of me would be brought to the front. He said it's not my fault that he feels like that because he knows his way of thinking can be fucked up and sometimes he can't help it, but that however, made him repulsed and less attracted to me, because it makes him feel like replacement even though he knows he 
isn't and that it's weird to get so close to someone who has already made important connections like that in their life before. 

He told me that I can take him as is or not, because while he is working on his issues he can't promise me anything and that talking to me about how he feels is a big step ahead that he wouldn't normally do because he is avoidant. Throughout this conversation I kept telling him he is hurting me, to which he only replied that he knows but he has to tell me how he feels.

After this conversation my world was shaken and I asked him if I should still get on the flight I had planned for Christmas to go see him. He said why wouldn't you? (like he didn't just tell me he was disgusted and repulsed). I haven't told him yet, but I don't think I want to get on that flight anymore. The flight is in 3 weeks and I can't cancel it, but losing those money wouldn't be an issue for me if it means I am saving myself some heartbreak and trauma.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4836824,public,top,self,AITA for wanting to miss my flight to not see my bf?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7qe5v/aita_for_wanting_to_miss_my_flight_to_not_see_my/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

My roommate has a cat and we are all on lease together. I am allergic to her cat. The cat is allowed by the landlord but is making me miserable. I can't enjoy any common areas of the house because of my allergies. I can only spend limited time in those areas (kitchen, living room, laundry room). I feel this is really unfair. The cat also keeps me up all night by meowing outside my door all night and scratching at it. Sometimes the cat will sneak into my room and it sets off my allergies. The cat also jumps up on the counters and the cabinets and I have refused to get any new or nicer furniture for the living room (the cat just scratches up the furniture). The cat also slams the lower cabinet doors at all hours of the day and night. My roommate who I'll call Kim won't keep the cat in her room at night (in my opinion the bare minimum so I can sleep) because she says the cat keeps her up at night. I have brought up these issues to Kim and she won't listen she refuses to do anything about it. Kim will just get mad at me for bringing it up even calmly.(she says I'm attacking her if I do) Last time I asked her about it she yelled in my face that she won't do anything about it. I have been trying to avoid the subject for a while but I'm getting sick of if. I have serious allergies and have been hospitalized in the past because of it. My s/o also doesn't like the way Kim handles the situation and is very concerned about my health. Kim refuses to do anything on her part. If the cabinet slamming bothers her she feeds the cat so the cat keeps doing it. She refuses to get child safety locks for the cabinets or clean up after her cat. Her cats fur is on all the furniture and the cats toys are all over the main areas. Kim has decorated the entire common area herself. Including her desk (takes up a lot of space). The only things of ours in the common areas are a poster my s/o put up, and a small picture. We also each have a futon in the living room the cat scratches both. I'm not sure what to do I thought about seeing if the landlord could do anything but I am unsure since the cat is on the lease. I feel trapped in my own house. The only cat free space is my room but the cat sometimes sneaks in which is a big problem because of my allergies. I feel this is unfair and Kim is a total AH. Is there a way to legally do something? I live in Wisconsin if that's important. We are all on the lease. The cat has done some damage to the house to tired of typing to get into details it's not a lot but enough for me to worry about my safety deposit. Is there anything I can do about my situation?

It almost caused an accident and in the moment she ""thought for sure it was going to be over"". I picked her up from work that night and she completely had a breakdown about how she thought she was going to never see me again. I feel awful for her. To add on to this:   
1) This has happened to her before with her previous car (That we sold to get her current car, it was of a similar age)  


2) She has a conversation with me 3 weeks ago about how she wanted a new car because she doesn't think her car was safe (although, we have had this conversation before). There was nothing wrong with the car that triggered this, but it's getting close to a cold season here. I told her we need to hold out, and should get new tiers for the moment.  


We have older cars (2009 &amp; 2010, both under 150k miles), but we keep up on maintenance &amp; inspections and they work well with expected repairs at that age.    


Now, my wife doesn't want to drive her car anymore, or my car (because it's just as old) because she no longer feels safe driving them. Now with this being the second time this has happened, she wants to get something new, or at least fairly new, in the next two weeks.  


I told her I want her to get a new car, but we need to hold out a few more months to save up some cash. Our money is tight, we're planning on buying a house next year so we need to keep saving for a down payment (we only have a total of 10k saved up, although we have no debt, this is really just an emergency fund) and the market is really, really bad for cars right now.  She broke down again about how about saving a little money isn't worth dying over, and while I really, really do understand her, making our largest purchase  \*ever\* in two weeks because of a scary experience sounds like we might be making an impulsive decision.    


To meet her in the middle we rented a car from a rental shop for now so should could take some time to driving something ""newer"" because I feel like I couldn't push her to drive my old car after her dealing with all of this, but after a week she will either need to start driving her car again, or my car.  


Am I being an insensitive asshole here?

I (19F) have a cousin, Ryan (29M). We didn’t grow up together but we were still close, with him calling and visiting us. Currently, me and family live abroad, but he’s still living in our home country. A few weeks ago, he told us he was getting married, and of course we were delighted! He’s my only cousin, so I was excited to see him be happy with his S/O. 

My family unable to attend his wedding ,unfortunately, as we currently cannot fly out due to some issues, but everyone is fine with it as he had promised to send us a video of his wedding. We have never met his fiancée in person before, but after a few video calls and messages we felt that she was not fit to marry Ryan. We felt like the fiancée, Ally (31F), was only with Ryan because of his money. Ryan’s maternal family was quite rich, with them owning several properties and some businesses. 

They already picked out a car to gift Ryan and Ally for their wedding, but she kept on telling Ryan that brand X was her dream car and it went on for so long that they had to buy another car to suit her preferences. Also, she kept raving on about how she wants only the BEST makeup artists, venue, dress etc, which tbh is fine but the way she expressed it made it seem like only the price tag mattered to her.

Ryan’s parents are divorced but they’re friends, but Ryan doesn’t like the topic being brought up. Whenever we do video calls with them, Ally always makes sure to mention that Ryan will “finally” get a true family experience, since her family members were very nice people. Ryan always seemed uncomfortable when it was brought up so we always tried to switch the topic, but yesterday was the final straw. We were having a nice chat when she brought up the family topic AGAIN, and proceeded to say things like how if she and Ryan have a child, she’ll make sure to keep the family together, unlike “some people”. This made me really pissed. It wasn’t even a joke at that point. So I called her out and said some mean things to her. She ended up crying and ending the call. My family (extended and all) are on my side for this, and Ryan is too, but he said I went too far and I should apologise to Ally since she was threatening to call off the marriage. Honestly, I don’t want to apologise and if she calls off the marriage I have one less annoyance in my life, so it’s a win win situation for me, but at the same time, I don’t want to ruin Ryan’s happiness.

So here it goes ;

I’m (25f) and my bf (28) we recently just moved in together we’ve been together for a year and a half.
I moved in to his place since he got a nicer, bigger but cheaper rent apartment and closer to work. 
And he got this one very nice soft amazing bedsheet. I’m a type of person who likes to splurge on bedsheet, bedcover, nice memory foam pillow, weight blanket, mattress, i think my bed should be as comfy as possible. 
And he got this one bedsheet thats smooth, lightweight, shrink resistant, it was truly the best bedsheet i ever slept on. 
So i want to get more of that, i asked him where he get those, and he said it was his ex Renee who bought it.
He used to date her for 3 years and live together for 6 months, she’s actually a mutual friend of mine. and she recently got married, she invited us to the reception and ceremony, we went there and no awkwardness and she start following me on instagram,things are very civil with us.

So a week a go i posted a picture of me taking a pottery class and she dm me and ask about the class, the price, location, etc. and i answer even encourage her to join and we exchange funny ghost quotes. And then i ask her, “btw, where did you get the silver-white bedsheet? Its really amazing i would like to buy it in different colors”
And then she left me on read, and then unfollowed my instagram and my boyfriend.

I didn’t think much of it but then our mutual friend Tiana, called me and said i was out of line to ask about a bedsheet, since it was the bed where she used to slept on with your bf, thats quite inappropriate. 
In my defend i already bought 2 different bedsheet that looks kinda the same to it, but it feels different, there are no tags or brand in the sheet or quilt or pillow case. 
There’s also time when i’m on vacation and the hotel got a nice mattress and i asked the hotel manager what is the brand of the mattress. 
Tiana said i should apologize and explain myself.
But i think that would be awkward, and my boyfriend also said she’s being weird, and i don’t need to explain myself he feels a bedsheet and a pan or a couch is no different, they used to cook in the same pan and watch movies in the couch together too, he ask her to take everything she needs and she bought during the course of time they lived together and she said it was ok consider it her 6 months rent, since she didn’t pay rent when they live together.

I’m at a loss here. I’m being told I’m the AH extraordinaire, whilst I think the other side is not just the AH, but also illegal.

My BF and I live in Europe. My BF comes just from the edges of Europe - a country that isn’t in the EU, is still developing, but one that has relatively close ties to the EU and is a place Europeans like to travel for tourism. Life in that country can be hard - but EU, alongside with many other international organisations, have deemed my BF’s country to be a safe place and having traveled there myself several times, I can attest that this place is safe for a woman to travel alone, let alone everybody else.

The gist of our recent fight is that two separate families of my BF’s family have decided to claim asylum in EU on bogus claims. One family asked for asylum from France, the other from Ireland. 

My BF’s extended families are not applicable for asylum under any circumstance. They don’t come from areas that are currently under crisis and they don’t come from areas that under or used to be under conflict. They’re not internal refugees either. They just don’t get paid as much as they’d like to and they want to live in Europe, specifically Western. They look down upon my BF because he lives in the “newer” EU and not in the West. 

One family that supposedly got a year’s permit in France already has a disabled child and they have been using said child as a reason for claiming asylum, saying they cannot get medical needs covered back at home. I know that to be a lie because the family didn’t GAF about the kid back home, he wasn’t even schooled in school, but at home because they were embarrassed. 

The other family is waiting in Ireland. They claim that one just has to wait 6 months, then you get permanent status and they can finally bring their two kids too. The kids have been telling everybody that they’re going to live in Ireland soon - that’s how often the parents tell them. 

Maybe I am an AH, but I told the extended family that what they’re doing is illegal and that they have no right to claim an asylum just because they no longer want to live in their own country, but have no education, no job experience nor language skills to support their emigration (both families were unemployed- low jobs were “beneath them”, good jobs weren’t available due to lack of skills). 

The same families that once mocked him for slaving away at school now tell him that he’s an idiot for not claiming asylum like they did because they will be in Western Europe and he isn’t. 

I admitted to my BF that I had considered notifying the authorities in France that the family claims asylum on bogus claims and that they have no real case. He told me that if I were to do that, not only was I an AH, but that he’d stop speaking to me because even though it was wrong of them to do, I should just let it go because it’s not like it harms me personally.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4836795,public,top,self,AITA for telling my BF and his family that what his relatives are doing is illegal and they should be deported?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7pwde/aita_for_telling_my_bf_and_his_family_that_what/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

They were roommates when we were. Scott was always super friendly towards me and we spent a lot of time when we were together with him. When Joe told him we were getting engaged he seemed unsurprised and very neutral about the situation. 

Once we got engaged things started changing. Scott would make side comments about how married people always became lame and would stop hanging out with their friends. We promised that wouldn’t happen and he would sigh or say sure. 

He made living arrangements with other people and started moving out. Soon my husband found an apartment to move into which was only a couple of blocks away from Scott’s new house. Looking back now it might’ve not been a coincidence. Scott asked to stay with us until his roommates moved in because he didn’t want to be there alone. We agreed for him to stay there until our wedding. He mostly would keep to himself in the other room only coming out to eat and use the restroom.

His birthday landed while he lived with us. We wanted to celebrate his birthday and we’re like his only family here so Joe made sure it was special inviting over friends and getting all his favorite foods from different restaurants. We made his cake from scratch and got him a couple of gifts. 

Everyone came to our house and Scott seemed really unimpressed. He ate and immediately left to his room to play games with his other friends. It felt really awkward in the room because we had no idea if he was coming back and we had our friends waiting there. We made the most of it and had fun. We could hear him talking into the mic (super small apartment) but he didn’t come out the rest of the time. This is were my husband and I started disagreeing. 

To me it felt rude that we tried to make it a special day but he just left us all without saying anything or if he was coming back. The next day my husband left the house and Scott came out when I was in the kitchen, he just walked past me to the friend to get a spoon and eat more cake. I didn’t bother to start a conversation.

When my husband came back home I told him how I felt and that it made me not like him as much as I had in the past. My husband was super offended and told me that I was looking too much into his actions saying I ATA.

(I'm sorry about format and grammar. English isn't my family's first language. This is happened on thanksgiving and I wanted things to cool down before posting) 


 I'm (26m) very close to my cousin Wednesday 24f (a I called her because of her style and her attitude. Yes I got permission to post). Wednesday loves horror movies and going out to our local club. There she met her boyfriend George (fake name) 

George (28m) is a 6'3 and heavy metal drummer for a local band on some weekends. But his job is a tattoo artist and his work is amazing. 

Sandy (29f) is Wednesday's sister. She's a total opposite of Wednesday. She's fashion forward and always in style.Sandy hates metal and always offers Wednesday a makeover. She told Wednesday that she'll be alone forever. 

So on thanksgiving, Wednesday brought George to meet the extended family. This is when I might be an asshole. Sandy everytime Wednesday is out of the room would flirt with George. He tries to walk away from it. But she follows and he was showing that he was uncomfortable. So when she asked why he wants Wednesday instead of her. 

I chipped in with ""Maybe she's not ugly on the inside like you are"". Sandy got mad and cussed me out before leaving as she caused a scene. 

 My aunt told me that was uncalled for and I should apologize. I told my aunt that what Sandy did was uncalled for and she made George uncomfortable by flirting with him when Wednesday was out of the room to help out. 

 My aunt left. She made a huge post about how thanksgiving is ruined because of Wednesday and me. She posted that I'm the asshole and I should apologize to Sandy.

The said friend has had a weekend off people, so on Monday morning we were catching up. She was at home sick, I was at work and not in the best mood because of some family problems. At some point she asked me if I think she is trustworthy and reliable, as her colleague had told her that she (the colleague) can never rely on my friend.

To this I replied that she probably is reliable and after my friend was not satisfied with the answer I told her that I think I would say that she is about 80% reliable. The friend said that that is good, but what would take it up to a 100%. As I was not in the best mood and also at work my answer was for her to analyze her behavior on her own. And I should have probably left it at this point.

On my lunch brake I decided to elaborate. I told her the things that she lacks in the reliability. Me asking her to keep something a secret and then finding out somebody else knows about it, her enthusiastically offering to help with something, but then when actually being asked for help not coming trough and how she always cancels our plans to meet or have a call because she is too tired. I said that I hope this didn't ruin her mood more, but help her understand where am I coming from.

Now the plan canceling had been a little argument earlier this year. Usually when she comes back to our hometown, to visit her mom, where I still live we make plans to meet up. There was a point where she had come back about 3 different times and rescheduled/cancelled about 5 times because of being too tired ( to be honest I had to reschedule one time too because I was going out of town). This meant that we haven't seen each other for a few months. At one point I got angry about this and blew up, but then I apologized and we moved on.

She said that this didn't change her mood and thanked me for being honest. The next message was that she never tells others what I have told her and that of course she is tired because she has her own apartment (during covid I had to move back in with my parents) and pets she has to think of, problems that I don't know of and that she isn't promising huge things, but sometimes unexpected things come along.

I told her that I understand all of that, and I don't hold it against anymore as I have stopped putting my energy into things I can't control anymore and that this is only my subjective opinion.

She said that she doesn't believe me that I do understand and that the fact that I said that it was my opinion is what hurt her and that maybe she also will stop putting energy in things that she cant control.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4836783,public,top,self,AITA for being brutally honest to my friend,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7pp8f/aita_for_being_brutally_honest_to_my_friend/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

[Tldr: My boyfriend lies all the time and not for the life of him, admit it. Accusations on my part leads to gaslighting on his part. Now one of his lies (possibly) led to the death of my cockatiel, to convict him I checked his browsing history.]


I've (f29) caught my boyfriend (m35) lying several times, but he always denies it, now matter the evidence and mostly blames me (why would I only seeking conflicts with him or how unfair these accusetions are). 

The situation escalated two days ago. I asked him to look after my sick bird for one evening and to turn on the heat lamp because I had nightshift.
When I got home the next morning, I found that my beloved Cockatiel had passed away and the lamp was out and cold. Absolutely devastated and sad, I went to my bf and broke the news to him. He seemed surprised.  
Then when I said, while curly up in bed next to him: ""You didn't check on the bird, did you?""  He got angry, he left the room and left me alone with my sadness and our restless and hungry dogs.
I also noticed that he couldn't have fed the dogs in the evening or let them out, later on. 

The next morning I confronted him about it and told him my suspicion, that instead of taking care of our pets, he spent (once again) the entire evening writing with women on dating/adult sites. The way he reacted told me I was spot on, but of course, he denied it as usual and tried to gaslight me (I would boycott the relationship, always looking for a reason to fight, I'm never satisfied with his actions and have been imagining everything anyway). 

I was so upset and frustrated with him that I checked his browsing history as that was the only way to prove it. And in fact, as soon as I left the house, he spent his entire evening on dating &amp; porn sites. Of course, this evidence didn't make him give in, he just got really pissed off and we haven't spoken to each other since.

I know I shouldn't have done this and I'm terribly sorry, but it seemed like my only chance to uncover the truth.

I told her I didn't want another mom. She was sad but said she understood. They married a few months after that and then when I was 9 she and my dad sat me down and told me she wanted to adopt me and that she loved me so much and her dream was to be my mom. I told them I still didn't think of her as my mom. She asked if I loved her enough to try, to give it a shot and we could wait on the adoption until I was ready. I said I didn't want to. She then said to do it because I loved her. Dad said there was no woman more deserving. I told them I didn't love her enough to let her be my mom. She cried. My dad told me he didn't know why I was lying but therapy would help me see I loved her.

I did go to therapy. I didn't change my mind on letting her be my mom/being adopted by her. So they tried to have a baby of their own. She was not able to get pregnant but they abandoned the idea of her getting her motherhood dreams out of me, which was good. But she couldn't get pregnant and so IVF was their next step. I'm not sure on all the details but they only got enough for one try and they waited and prepped her so the pregnancy would stick. She made it to 14 of 15 weeks and then she miscarried three weeks ago. It was bad. She was broken and she ended up staying in the hospital so they could help her.

My dad decided that now I need to give her what she wants. That 10 years of knowing her and 9ish years of her being his wife means she has been my mom whether I like it or not and I need to start showing her that I love and care about her. He told me the adoption would mean the world to her and would be the biggest help while she grieves. I told him I had enough and his wife's grief was not enough for me to let her adopt me. I told him I did not think of her as my mom, I did not love her, I was not a toy that could fill her motherhood desire.

We have known each other at work for about 3 months, very off and on, and I only really started hanging out with her say for an extra month. When we first started dating everything was great, honeymoon period am I right? But ever since she started on her birth control all her libido has basically gone to zero. It was such a drastic change in that she won’t even cuddle me anymore and I feel like I am initiating all of the intimate/affectionate actions such as hand holding and kissing. I am becoming jealous of her cat which kinda angers me. Idk what to do at this point because I would love to stay with her but I also have needs of my own. She is wanting children eventually and so do I which should in theory allieviate this problem but what if she decides to change her mind? Also what if she treats me this way after we have kids? We have talked about the libido issue already and I bought her some ointment that she claims will stimulate her into wanting sex but she has never used it.

She doesn't like me because I've taken her son away from her and all that but she's never been honest either to me or my husband about her dislike towards me. She'll only throw some masked insults to my husband about me but to my face she's acting like an angel and says how much she adores me and views me as her own daughter etc. Behind my back both her and my SIL say the most horrible stuff.

There's many horrible things she's done but on this post I'll focus on how she acts regarding us trying to balance time between families.

Since the first years of my husband and I being together MIL always had the expectation that her and her family should be prioritised more than my family. In some cases she spoke as if I had no family when my family is well and I have a great relationship with them. She always had demands that we spend every single holiday with them and whenever we balanced things out between them and my family she threw tantrums and constantly cried to my husband about how he abandons his dear mommy for his ""new family"". At first my husband felt bad for her but then understood her theatrics and anytime she throws a tantrum he's telling her ""like it or not that's what's gonna happen, go cry now and deal with it"". We still try to be fair and balance holidays.

Another example is how she demanded that during our wedding day I should get dressed at her own house because I'm like her daughter and she deserved to see me getting ready more than my own parents did. When I chose to get ready to my parent's house MIL was mad and said I disrespected her and that I don't consider her family because I did that.

So this year my husband and I made the plan. Thanksgiving lunch with his family. Thanksgiving dinner with mine. Xmas with his family and New Year's with mine.

Guess what. MIL didnt like that. After we were about to leave thanksgiving lunch with her she started making comments again about how we're picking my family over her and how she'll spend new years without us now too because we prefer my family more. Totally ignoring the fact that we'll spend Xmas with her. My husband even tried to accommodate her once and asked her if she'd prefer for us to spend Xmas or New year's with her and I told him no, she won't dictate our schedule, enough.

After she made that comment my husband ignored her and was like ""yeah ok you'll start crying again"" and she started yelling at my husband about how he's picking me over her and my family over her. She started throwing insults about my family and I couldn't hold myself but to talk back to her and tell her off for being a selfish person who expects the world to revolve around her and that she needs a wake-up call that she's not the only person in our lives.

My husband told me to get in the car and go.

as far as i know, the slur was initially contrived as a derogatory term towards chinese immigrants in america, and then was later used generally to essentially all asian ethnicities. 

the main point that personally got me to feel that all asian ethnicities “should” be able to say it (more so not be scrutinized if they do choose to say it) is because of the g slur (ends in -ook- o -uk-). so the g slur applies to those of korean, vietnamese, and filipino decent as far as i am aware. the reason that this leads me to believe that the c slur “belongs” to anyone of asian decent is because:
if we say that the c slur only applies to chinese people, then does that not undermine the fact that people of other asian ethnicities have also faced the racial discrimination that has been associated with the connotation of that word. the word is generally known as a racial slur rather than an ethnic one. i just personally feel as if saying that the g slur only applies to these three ethnicities and the c slur only applies to this specific one, then that leaves too much of an implication that all other asian ethnicities haven’t bared any weight of the racial discrimination that they have historically faced.

i hope that some people with any background in ethnic studies can give some input on this.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4836733,public,top,self,AITA for thinking that the c slur can be used by non-chinese people of asian decent,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7p43v/aita_for_thinking_that_the_c_slur_can_be_used_by/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

Long story short, kitten got stuck up a tree, i climbed up and rescued him and while getting out of the area i jumped through some brambles and had thorns sticking in my head and arm.

I got cross with wife for not coming over to help quicker with thorns in me (was painful) and cat. This has then spiralled into a larger argument over this as she thinks she acted reasonably and i cant believe she didnt rush over. 

Her point of view from my understanding is i am an idiot for getting stuck and should have just put cat down and basically being a wimp by making a meal out of some thorns. Also it would have been more of a faff to put the dog poo bag down.

We spent a lot of time together as it is, but around 3 months ago she lost her apartment and was essentially homeless as she didn’t have somewhere to live. I offered for her to move in with me, rent free, short term whilst she hunts for a new place, which she accepted. We share my bedroom, I split half my closet space, share my double bed, I pretty much gave up 50% of my life to accommodate her. I couldn’t date or have guys over as she was always there and my own space had become ‘our space’. I did ALL of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping etc while she just sits around and watches me. My shopping bill has almost tripled since she moved in  as she has expensive tastes and doesn’t like the ‘cheap stuff’. I reached breaking point around 3 weeks ago when I demanded she pay for the groceries and do her own laundry. She claimed that I am taking advantage of her vulnerable position and using her to afford my rent. We got into a huge argument and I kicked her out.

Yesterday, they passed away. I won't get into who's at fault or what happened.

[Bird tax](https://imgur.com/a/G13zHEe) (SFW)

I don't want to make their cage or remaining food go to waste. I want to buy my own single cockatiel and have it in my room well away from any chance that this incident happens again. My reasoning for this is that having been a dog family for all my life plus many years, some birds with personality, character that whistled and were naturally curious was and is very cool to me. Dogs are very bland in comparison in my opinion, or at least the way their personality develops in our house.

They were like friends to me, a hole that is again empty due to depression and whatnot caused by quite a bit of mental abuse and neglect causing me to not have any real friends.

My mom said their cage will be dismantled and their stuff will be put into storage and might consider getting a replacement a few years down the line due to the bad taste the whole experience left in our families' mouth. She said I could not get a bird, but I don't care. My reasoning for this is that I see her as the cause of the aforementioned mental abuse. She doesn't do it on purpose, but rather treats me and situations in the complete wrong manner, either putting down my skills, calling my lazy, etc. I might (no diagnosis yet) have been born with ADHD, which of course has gone untreated and has been severely aggravated by her behavior and ignorance. This bird would be a small bastion of happiness in a life I see as unsatisfactory and sad.

As I'm growing older I see more and more how badly things have gone when it comes to my mental health. But enough of this tangent. WIBTA?

Edit: another justification I am making for this decision is that my mom tossed them in the trash like they were undesired vermin.

I (M26) was in my hometown staying with my parents for the weekend, including a friendsgiving with my high school group, who are still my best friends. We have drinks, stay up late talking, stay over. This year our night ended much earlier than expected and I wasnt comfortable driving home. Easy enough, my parents house is 3 mins away so I texted my sister and she picked me up. In my mind, no big deal, routine responsibility. 

Only concern was my parents. They haven't had a drop of alcohol in their life. They have strong convictions, don't want to support an addictive industry. My sisters and I grew up under that, but since we've gotten older we see differently than them. It's led to some conflict over the years. While we love and respect their beliefs, we just dont find it as personally convicting and since we've each turned 21, we've come to enjoy some drinks in social and casual settings. We tell them essentially that we got this. That usually gets followed with a ""I just still don't understand it"" and we more or less agree to disagree.

Well, next day dad asks to talk. He hadn't slept at all, wasn't comfortable with my bringing the situation into his house and he was feeling that I took a step towards alcoholism. Mom asked me to consider costing me my gf. Now I'd like to think I'm doing well for myself, my gf is amazing, I defended my masters thesis this fall and love my job. We talk regularly so my parents knew all that and their support is important to me. Go from that support to fear of my life falling apart and the realization that I'm going to have to convince my parents I'm not an alcoholic, that's a huge emotional 180 that I wasn't prepared for. 

I kinda snapped. Did apologize that I brought it home but said very bluntly that it was in fact a safe decision among safe people, that I've been open for years and never gave them a reason not to trust me, that I'm a full-blown successful adult and if they really believe that they need to get better at managing their fears without putting it on me to convince them. Also mentioned that my gf and I are solid and we're doing just fine thank you very much.

Instantly felt terrible. It rippled through the rest of the weekend, they seemed pretty reserved &amp; hurt, didn't want to share much. I love my parents and of course I want them not to worry. I actually appreciate being raised that way, it led to my cautious approach and I credit them for a good head around alcohol. I just got so scared of them actually believing their fearful imagery so easily, I lost my cool. I stand by my responsibility that friendsgiving night &amp; where I'm at in life, and there's some healthy parent/adult child boundary lines to draw, but ultimately me asking to be treated like an adult requires approaching conversations like one.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4836719,public,top,self,AITA for yelling at my parents about alcoholism on Thanksgiving?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7oukq/aita_for_yelling_at_my_parents_about_alcoholism/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

Safe to say they mentally fucked me up, and I’m still trying to heal from it. It was awful and I’m lucky I had enough sense to break up with them when I did, because if no one made me realize it I’d probably still be with them. Anyways, what frustrates me is the overlap in friends we seem to have. When we were together, they didn’t really have any other friends aside from me and a couple others I didn’t know, but after we broke up they seemed to have fostered friendships with…. literally all of my friends. 


To be fair I don’t have many, but I would say it’s at least 8 friends, all that they are friends with too. I don’t care if they’re friends with them I guess, but they’ll constantly talk to me ABOUT them and how nice/fun/cool they are despite me a.) being massively uncomfortable hearing that, and b.) knowing full well what they did to me and apparently just ignoring it.


I’ve brought it up that it makes me uncomfortable multiple times, and I was astonished to learn a lot of them think I’m being a dick. One even suggested I “talk it out” with my ex. It makes it feel inescapable, that no matter what they’ll be in my life and around everything. I feel awful constantly. A couple people at my work told me I should drop them (or tell them I can’t be around them anymore if this keeps happening and choose who to keep) and also make new friends.

One of the things on my short list of wants was a garage. I detail cars when i have time as an extra source of income. I was looking more for an income property that i could rent part out while also living there to cut my bills back. I wrote out full budget projections for these types of properties. Some properties we saw would have left me with a solid income from renting out units. I ended up (overbudget) with a 2 bedroom bungalo which my dad assured me we would renovate the basement into a unit. I actually cried the night i heard we got it because i thought it was a terrible idea. But it was exactly what my dad wanted, i got my garage, and he assurred me he would help with the extra expense. Renovations never happened, my mortgage went up with the interest rates, and he has been sending money to me and my sister(28f, lives with me) to help with the bills. Total bills are about 4k monthly and after seeing how expensive the bills are, hes been sending about 2k to help while also telling me i need to get a better job to afford my own bills. Now he tells me that hes going to look at a car next weekend and hes going to be parking it in the garage at my house for the winter. My dad is not poor by any means.

During this frantic three-minute call I was:

- Informed that I am in the Will

- Informed that I am entitled to half the estate (from a pot of money)

- Informed that as the estate was willed 50/50 “we will have to talk sometime or something otherwise my kids get nothing” (i.e., informed that he will essentially contest the split because he believes it is unfair his children were not specifically designated as beneficiaries also)

- Directed to go to the bank ASAP to sign a consent to release the funds (no details given)

A week later and I have to ask to see the Will. No further information was offered or shared in any form.

So my older brother had issues. He was essentially one of those bratty and evil kids you read stories about.

He got older and got into drugs and other illegal stuff. Our parents had enough and kicked him out after he became uncontrollable. It was mostly done for me as I was still pretty young.

We didn’t hear from or about him until he was in his early twenties. Turns out, he was married, had a good job and a kid on the way. Now he has 3 kids and is still happily married to a very lovely woman. 

We see each other on Christmas, Easter, thanksgiving and a week during the summer but he mostly comes so our parents can see the kids. He usually doesn’t say anything and keeps to himself. 

At first I was afraid, confused and resentful for a lot of things but I have since forgiven him. He’s not a bad guy-honestly never was. He just needed help. 

My parents hosted thanksgiving and it was pretty normal. The usual. 

All of a sudden, there’s a sound of glass breaking. My nephew accidentally dropped a plate while trying to help my mom set up. 

My mom loses it. She starts yelling at him. The poor kid starts sobbing (he’s only 8) and runs to his mom. 

My brother obviously asks our mom what that was about and that it was just an accident and my mom immediately goes “oh shut up, maybe if I yelled at you more you wouldn’t have made everyone’s life a living hell.” 

My brother didn’t even react. He and his wife just gathered their kids and left. My mom immediately started to cry once she realized he wasn’t coming back and said that she didn’t deserve this and that he has no right to keep her away from her grandkids. 

I told her that he actually does have the right to do that especially since she lost it on his innocent 8 year old son.

My mom started to cry even harder and said that she didn’t need my opinion and that she can’t believe I’m on his side after everything he did and everything she did to protect me from his addiction etc. “I kicked my child out of the house for you.” Is what she said. In a way, I guess she’s right. I probably should’ve kept my mouth shut.

I asked if she could also fly back home to get it or get her mom to fly here and deliver it but she said she couldn't get the approval from work to travel. 

When I told her no, final, she said she'd just ask someone else then and said it was really important for her and would have appreciated it if I could have at least tried. I feel like this was passive aggressive.

I could be the asshole for not getting the inhaler for her even if it was unlikely to cause issue.

On our 2nd date he shared that he had a recent positive biopsy for cancer. And, I was warned by Chris, and his friends that his parents were horrible people. His mother meets all the criteria for a sociopath, dad is a narcissist. They treat their adult children horribly, use them to meet their emotional needs while offering nothing but manipulation and criticism. All the while roping them in with strategic (small) financial gifts, cutting them off when they don’t do as they do - basically using money to ensure loyalty and proximity.  Add their toxic individualistic values, and they truly are some of the meanest, most selfish people I have met.

I fell in love with Chris and despite this all, partnered up. We had an amazing connection, and I felt it would be worth any pain to share even a short time with him. I tried a lot in the beginning with the parents treating them to dinner, inviting them to visit or vacation with us, buying them gifts, etc. None of this was ever reciprocated. I was mocked, disrespected, and very obviously excluded from all family references, holiday newsletters or family photos, etc.

All the while, Chris was looking at a chance to beat this disease. There was a window where with proper treatments, less stress/more rest he could have created a window of remission. Yet his parents refused to help, even when in the midst of debilitating treatments. They kept insisting ‘everyone dies, and it will be better for you to have something to do’ and made it clear they disrespected his choice to quit working- even if he might have a chance at a bit longer life.

As a result, I took on most of our expenses, while singlehandedly caring for him while burning through my retirement. I also worked myself into chronic illness that has left me with chronic fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, etc.

We didn't make it a a couple (the stress broke us) but we are still best friends. I'm here for him. Chris is now staying in an empty apt his uncle owns, while myself and his sister take care of him 24/7 - he doesn’t have much time left. I am sleeping in my van as short term rentals are out of my budget at this point. His family has made it clear they think I should be handling ALL of this on my own.

His mother did agree that she would pay for whatever funeral arrangements Chris would like. (So annoying she will pay for him to die and not to live). Yesterday we learned that this limited to 25% less than needed for a basic funeral. As a result she won't pay for his gravestone - or a reception- and they conveyed to me that they expect me to pay for it. I replied we would have an unmarked grave until they can “scrape up some cash” for a headstone. This feels petty, and I  feel I have to say no, for my own sake. Do I have unrealistic expectations about how loved ones/family ‘should’ show up for each other?

I asked them to tell me the reasons and they just ignored me and left.

I called my neighbour and asked her to explain herself and why animal services let her off so easily. She basically told me off for being all up in her business and told me she has no reason to give me an explanation on why she doesn't take her dog for walks and I should just mind my business.

I M(18) was very good friends with this girl f(19)let’s call her C. I slowly fell for C over a period of time. Sadly she didn’t. My best friend M(20) had a crush on C(knowing I liked her) and dated her for 2 weeks then broke up with her which really changed views on dating saying that she would never date anyone ever again. 

I did try for C and we texted every single day and became very close we had a good friendship and I didn’t want to push our boundaries but eventually I fell in love with her so I did start sending these cringe texts and C did  so as well. one day my sisters friend who is a good friend of C told me that her and C were talking about me and C said “I know he’s the right guy for me but I will never go for him because he’s fat” this physically broke my heart and I was devastated. I never told C I found out.   

One day C sent me some screenshots of all the cringe conversations I had with her in private and I told her to promise me not to send these to anyone and she agreed

But later that day C’s friend(whom I have never talked to and don’t follow on Instagram) had posted all those conversations onto her story and thousands of people had seen all those screenshots which were meant to be private and my friends who followed her started sending her story to me. 

This just broke me and C hadn’t spoken to me about it and pretended it never happened I decided I was done with her and I blocked her without telling her anything about this. 

Her friend later messaged me from another account calling me an AH and to get over this and this was nothing

I, 15F, have a best friend I'm gonna call Dave. Dave, 14M, has a partner who we'll call Grey.  
  Earlier today I got a text from Dave saying that his grandfather had passed away, and that he wouldn't be coming to school the next day. Of course, I give him my condolences and tell him that it's okay that he won't be going to school. Grey says it's not fair to them because ""Dave is their safety blanket."" 

  
  My boyfriend, (John), tells Grey that Dave can stay home if he needs a few days, and John and I both tell Grey that we'll be there to hang out with Grey and keep them company. Grey does NOT like this, and tells John and I that we aren't the same as Dave's company. Understandable, I get that they didn't mean for their words to come across as rude. I leave the chat alone and about 2 or 3 hours later, Dave texts me outside of the  groupchat. He tells me that Grey is sounding like one of Dave's ex boyfriends, Noah. Noah was notorious for having attention seeking behavior and being overall toxic.

  Jokingly, I say ""Oh do tell"" and I'm hit with a massive paragraph. To sum it up, Dave tells me that Grey is saying that they're not going to sleep tonight because they don't see the point of sleeping if they're not going to see Dave tomorrow. I calmly respond with ""wow."" I tell Dave that Grey is definitely exhibiting attention seeking behaviour, and that even though I care about Grey, they need to realize that not everything can be about them all the time. Dave starts defending for Grey, saying that it's been a stressful day all around. I tell Dave that even if he doesn't realize it, he's making excuses for Grey, and I tell him that he's basically babysitting Grey at this point. Dave agrees with me and apologizes to me for having to deal with all of this, and tries to sleep.

  Later, Grey tells the groupchat that they're going to a mental hospital for tonight because they ""can't stop switching."" Nobody knows what they're talking about, and John decides to ask what the hell Grey is talking about. Grey suddenly mentions their DID which has never been brought up before and then stops texting the groupchat. When they come back, they say they passed out from stress. At this point, none of us have enough energy to deal with this so John and I just move on after making sure that they're okay. We send a few memes into the groupchat and ask Dave about a project that's due soon, but Grey goes in to an absolute fit and starts accusing us of not caring or holding any feeling of love toward them because John didn't know that they had DID, and because Dave and I had texted behind their back about them.

Dave claims to have not told Grey about our conversation, but there was no other way Grey would know. Dave thinks I took it too far by calling Grey attention seeking. Other friends of ours agree with Dave, but John thinks I was perfectly justified.

We got pretty serious to the point where I had practically moved into her place and we were spending holidays with each other’s families. Our relationship was going fine until we went home for the summer. Due to unresolved feelings she had for her ex and her being back in the same area as him she made some poor decisions and admittedly completely sabotaged our relationship. She saw that she had made a mistake and hurt me so she promised that when we were back in the same city we would work together to fix things and that she messed up and was going to make it right. She promised and told me I had to promise too and since she didn’t at any point cheat on me and I saw a possibility of us fixing this I promised too. Instead of spending my summer getting over her I spent it preparing to get back with her. She gets an apartment in the same building as me and I help her move in as school is starting. When we sit down to talk about what happens now she says she changed her mind and won't have enough time to fix a relation ship. At this point I would just count my losses, quit talking to her completely and move on the only issue is we share a lot of friends including my best friend (21 m) who I currently live with. Since our break up they have only gotten closer to the point where she is constantly in our apartment in his room, wearing is clothes, after parties sleeping on his couch in his room and the most recent thing and the reason I'm making this post is he has started staying the night at her place in her bed. Its frustrating because she clearly lied about having no time but she's spending it in the room right beside mine.  Not only has this made it incredibly hard to get over her but it has also made me highly suspicious of their relation ship. I have confronted my roommate about this twice now both times not trying to be accusatory while asking if their is anything going on between them and telling him how I personally think its weird. Sharing clothes maybe but I definitely wouldn't spend the night in one of my friends ex's bed. He denied that anything was happening but I still feel really uncomfortable with the whole thing. Her sabotaging the relationship as well as leading me on all summer really negatively effected my mental health and now that my best friend is acting this way its like I lost the 2 closest people I had. I don't know how to feel or what to do. I'm thinking of confronting him a 3rd time being a little more stern with how inappropriate I find their relationship but I don't want to push him away by getting mad at him and losing my best friend even more than it feels like I already have but I can't continue to feel this uncomfortable.

So a few days ago I sat in one of my friend’s classroom and we played some mobile games. While I was distracted with this game that we played I accidentally rolled my chair on a charger and the charger made her pc fall to the ground. The pc is not damaged, but the charger broke.

 I checked with IT and they said the charger would cost 30 USD to replace. And I thought that was a reasonable price and asked who’s at fault for breaking the charger and the IT lady told me that it was 110% her fault and that she had to replace it. You see, we are supposed to have our pc fully charged and ready for school and make sure that if we charge that the cable isn’t in the way and it was. It was between two desks that I was going through.
 I see this happen all the time, the only difference here is that the charger actually broke. And I myself think that I should be paying half since I could be more careful and when I told her this she got this big attitude (she is one of this stereotypical blonde popular girls).She told me that I should pay the whole thing since she wasn’t even there when it happened, and I do see where she is coming from, but then again it is her responsibility to make sure that this doesn’t happen. And I don’t even have to pay anything at all. I am offering to pay half because I myself think I should do so. 
And now I’m thinking trough this over and over again and I’m wondering am i the asshole and should I pay everything? It’s not that I can’t afford it, it’s just that I don’t want to pay everything when she gives me an attitude like that. She could say it in a nicer and more adult like way. We are not 13 anymore.

To which then my step dad says if you think X person was a terrible president imagine how terrible Meghan Markle would be.

For context my step dad talks about Meghan. A lot. At least once a week or whenever she appears on the news he just goes on and on about her being X, Y and Z. I personally have no interest in her or keep up with her on social media. I know she married Prince Harry and I heard she has a kid. I also watched Suits a few years ago. That’s it.

So after my step dad keeps complaining about Meghan I was annoyed. It’s the same routine over and over. And to be honest I’m sick of hearing about her from him. I said ‘who cares? You’re a bit obsessed with her.’ I recall I was definitely calm and casual in my delivery. 

He starts getting angry at me and says ‘you’re not keeping up with the news haven’t you?’ I don’t hear about her much at all on the afternoon news and he’s on Facebook a lot so I suspect that’s where he’s hearing things about her.

My response was ‘I do not. I only ever hear about her from you. You keep talking about her. It’s so random that you’d bring her up now.’ 
 
He says to me ‘well its because there was an ad on TV and it’s part of the conversation, and if you don’t like it I’m not going to talk to you.’ He’s since been giving me the silent treatment while I do stuff around the house, scowling. He seems really upset.
