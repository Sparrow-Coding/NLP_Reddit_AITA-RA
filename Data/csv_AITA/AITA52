The issue is with Steve. After being single for the past three or four years he finally has a girlfriend, Pam (f60-ish). Everyone was very happy for him. After meeting her a few times, I commented to Steve that she's very nice and seems to have a heart of gold but didn't seem to be very smart and was a little needy. He wasn't offended and agreed. He said her good qualities out weigh her bad points. And I said as long as he's happy that's all that mattered. 

Since at time, I've been around her several more times. To say that she's not very smart and a little needy was definitely an understatement! She literally needs help with everything, I'm not sure how she's made it though life, her ex-husband must be a saint for putting up with her for so long. 

It's gotten to the point that I can't stand to be around her. She drives me nuts. She repeats everything five or six times, can't figure things out on her own, etc. I'm always nice to her, for Steve's sake but if there is a way that I don't have to sit near her when we're all out then I take that option every single time. She on the other hand will always choose to sit near me even if that mean she's not near Steve. 

The issue at hand: We were all at a bar together. The others wanted to go to another bar, I wanted to go to the market and then home. No problem until Pam heard that I was going home. She and Steve where in one car. She decided she'd had enough and wanted to go home too. Steve said, no problem go with OP. I was like seriously... WTH! I told her I had to stop at the market for a few things and she said no problem. Now I have to spend like 40 minutes alone with her! So we leave, but I decide I'll drop her off and go to a different market than I was planning on going to just so I don't have to walk around a grocery store with her. I couldn't get the specific items at the market I ended up going to and was even more mad about the situation.

Both of us are students and since the city we live in is facing a huge housing crisis at the moment, we took in a friend of ours in September to stay in our living room temporarily. Initially this was only until he found somewhere else to stay so we didn't charge him rent for September and October.

As a side note, my flatmate and I are very clean so him moving in with us got tedious after he started to leave the living room in a state and smell it up (I presume he didn't shower too often or take care of his personal hygiene). There were multiple times where he left the bathroom window open, once when we had all left the flat. He also left the front door open at night one time, during which anyone could have entered the flat from our close.

In the end, we charged him rent in November (higher than what would have been the case if we had split the rent 3 ways but we figured that we needed to give him an incentive to find a new place, and make up for September and October). Throughout his time here, we split the bills for electricity, gas and WiFi 3-ways between us. All in all, we charged him ca. 750 GBP (incl. rent and bills). At the same time, my flatmate and I paid 2000 GBP + between ourselves for the same.

After we charged him rent for November, he found another accommodation quickly and opted to stay in an AirBnB for the rest of December. He only told us he was moving out a day before, and didn't even say thanks when he left.

I know it was maybe mean to charge him rent considering we only have 2 keys (so he had to leave every time we were out of the house 9-7), and the fact that we were nagging him about keeping clean.

Hit by a drunk teen driving a BIG truck a few years ago. Lots of hospital and doctor visits. Newest on the list: Heart Surgery and Pacemaker a few days ago (Happy Thanksgiving!!).

I had to go in to the pharmacy, which is located at the medical clinic where my Primary Care Physician is located. The Pharmacist told me that I had to update my information, in order to keep the meds costs down.

I went to the reception area. The young person asked for my name, which is SOP. I spell it, as its Dutch and has a lot of vowels, to make it easy on everyone. Then I give my first name and date of birth.

The person keeps asking me for my last name, my first name and DOB, yet can't find it. She giggles a lot and bats her eyes, thinking that I'll give her a pass for being incompetent. The fourth time she asks me to spell my name and ""what's your first name?"" I told her that my first name is I WANT TO SEE YOUR SUPERVISOR.

Supervisor comes over, making excuses for the receptionist. ""She's only been here a month.""

My response: ""She's been here a month and hasn't learned how to type in a name in your system, and she relies on being a giggly sweet young thing, in order to get a pass?""

The supervisor was bristling and I cut her off at the pass. ""I'm in a lot of pain, because of heart surgery and new pacemaker. See???""  I pulled open my shirt neck, showing the four inch cut in my chest, bruising, stitches and all.""

Supervisor backs down, takes the information ONE TIME, finds me, updates the information and I can finally get my prescriptions.

Question: Am I a complete jerk for expecting people to be efficient and to listen to patients, and to have no patience for giggly sweet young things who expect to be given a pass, when they don't learn to perform their jobs?

The beginning of our relationship was super easy. However, it all went downhill once I started working.

During the summer, I work for my brother-in-law who is a luxury real estate agent (I'm basically his personal assistant). I love my job. My parents are not well-off, and I am determined to create a life for myself in which I am financially stable and can take care of them. Cam's family is incredibly wealthy, and they always have been. I didn't think this difference would cause any tension between us, as we live in an affluent area and the majority of my close friends come from rich families. Here's some context...

**Notes about Cam:**

* he does not have a job, and never has (makes fun of how much I work)
* he doesn't really care about school, despite the fact that his parents pay for him to go to a private college-prep school
* he hates driving, and I am often the one to take us places
* often has mood swings where he randomly gets quiet and withdrawn for no visible reason
* hates waking up early
* hates hanging out w/ our friends/other ppl; prevents me from hanging out w/ them
* blames me for all his negative emotions
* lays in his room and does nothing when he's not w/ me

**Notes about me:**

* I can get carried away with prioritizing my job/academics to the point where I neglect my relationships/friendships
* My primary focus right now is setting myself up for a good future (college), not this relationship
* I am pretty extroverted and often mistakenly assume that other people are too
* I am (sometimes overly) obsessed with being financially stable
* I love waking up early
* I hate being wrong

This all exploded yesterday. We had the school day off, so we went to one of our fave spots in the city and walked around/shopped for awhile. I drove. On our way home, I noticed that my car needed gas, so I pulled over at some random gas station to fill it up. The gas station was older, so the pumps were different than what I was used to. I asked him to come help me, to which he responded, **""I don't know how to pump gas.""** I laughed because I thought he was joking. He wasn't. He said that his tank is always filled because his mom periodically fills it up for him. I said, ""Cam. You're literally 18 years old, how do you not know how to pump gas?"" He got really upset and defensive, and we got into an argument. I said he was unmotivated, which really offended him. I dropped him off at home and we haven't talked since.

Keep in mind I'm only detailing the bad side of our relationship- he does a lot of sweet things for me, and I love him a lot.

My wife and I are not upset at each other, however her friend may think I am angry with her and truthfully I’m just fine with that for now. Although, I do not plan on harboring any long term animosity. 

Everyone in the context of this story is in their early to late 30s. 

A few weeks ago my wife went out with her friend (Meg) while I looked after our infant. Meg’s bf (Dave) ended up and joining them out for drinks and Dave brought a friend (Dink). Dink ends up enamored with my wife, talking to her the whole time and telling her how great and beautiful she is. I know this because Meg brought it up a week or so later when we were all (Me, wife, Meg) together. Naturally, this raised eyebrows, but I trust my wife completely and from the way it was being spun: “Dink is just a nice guy who is about empowering women”. If anything, I thought it was nice for her to go out and get some attention as our life with an 11 month old has been hard work to say the least. Obviously I know Dink is a single male and wants to hook up with her. Again, I am comfortable in saying there is zero percent chance of that happening. 

Fast forward to last night. We are together in the bedroom with our baby and I am on her phone looking up something baby related we are talking about. A text from Meg comes through: “Dink wants me to tell you he adores you and can’t wait to see you again.” Ok. This for me crosses a line. It was cute and funny or whatever that one night I guess, but Meg, you are essentially wingman-ing it for Dink at this point. I send a text from my phone to a group text with me, wife, and Meg: “Tell Dink to watch his back.” Meg never responded to me, but has told wife she really hopes I’m not mad at her.

Background: he was given to my cousin when we were little (3 and 4), but my aunt didn't want dogs, so she was sent to live with my grandparents. 
She lived in the yard for about 12 years, only me and occasionally my cousin would play with her (she is a small dog, so she could have lived inside), my cousin never paid attention to her and my aunt didn't like her because she was dirty (my aunt suffers from depression and other disorders that I don't know about, so she acted out a lot with my cousins).

One day we decided to have her professionally bathed, that's when my aunt decided that she always loved her and that she was hers. She didn't care about her health or her meals, she just held her sometimes and told her she was very pretty.

When she got cancer, they were sad, but never bothered to take her to the doctor or give her medicine, they even went so far as to say that we would not have taken her to the doctor when we asked them to cover part of the expenses (it was a lot of money and we covered it between my grandparents, my mother and me).

When we brought her home we asked my grandparents for permission, and then my cousin (mainly out of courtesy, since he was the one who got along best with the dog).

When she died we put the ashes at my grandparents' house, but I didn't like her being there, in the last years it became a very toxic place and the dog was not happy there, so I brought them to my house.

Now my aunt and cousin are complaining saying that it was their dog (although they never cared for it) and they want it back.

It's in a US state that is traditionally a hot real estate market. The mortgage has been paid off, so they own it in their 50-50 partnership free and clear.

They are both retirement age, so about a year ago they decided to wind up the business in the coming year.  A few months ago, they decided to sell the building.  They have always done business somewhat informally using connections.  They got an offer from one of those connections, who is a friend of theirs, to buy the building for $4.5 million. Both my father and his partner did well from the business, but their half of $4.5 million would be a substantial boost to each of their net worths.

I have a sister and the other partner has two sons. My sister and the two sons are fine people, but none of them work for the business and work in blue collar jobs.  I work in finance and have a focus on real estate, so I know this business well.  My father and his partner told me they thought $4.5 million was a good offer, but wanted my opinion. I did some research and told them we could do better. I told them I would help on the condition that I receive 5% of any net amount they receive over $4.5 million. They both agreed.

I executed a strategy of leasing the building to a strong credit, national industrial company under a 10 year lease for market rent and, knowing that the financial market values the income stream more than they value a vacant building, took the building to market with the lease in place.  After commissions and transaction costs, but before my 5%, they sold the building for $7.8 million. I made $165K off of the deal and my father and his partner split just over $7.6 million, much better than the original $4.5 million offer.

I offered to give my parents the $165K, but they told me to keep it, that they didn't need the money (obviously) and that I earned it.  My parents and my dad's partner were quite happy with the extra $3+ million. Unfortunately, my sister and the partner's sons are pissed. So is the ""friend"" who through he had a deal at $4.5 million.  My sister and the sons think I stole from my dad and his partner and, as family, should not have taken the $165k and instead helped for free.  The friend is telling people I stole the building out from under him (there had been discussions, but no signed LOI or purchase agreement).  The friend is a real estate estate developer, so I think he was just trying to low ball them.

Rent here is cheap though and it allows me to live without roommates, which I enjoy. I live here with my dog, a 3 year old female husky/shepherd mix, who loves playing with other dogs. She isn't the best with strangers and is very protective of me (she's seen me get assaulted before so she's quick to keep people away), but we've been working on her reactivity and she's been getting better with time.

I've lived here since mid-August and so far haven't had any issues. My post concerns a newer dog that I've never seen before this past week. It appears to be a Bulldog, which I have no issue with, but said dog keeps attempting to attack my dog. My dog is dog friendly and jumps at the opportunity to play with another dog, even if said dog is showing clear signs of aggression.

This dog has torn part of the screen off my patio door attempting to get to my dog through the glass. Both times I've seen this dog it's been off leash (which is strictly against the apartment policy) and is clearly not dog friendly. I can hear it growling and snarling through the glass of my patio door, meanwhile my dog would be whining in excitement over the possibly of playing with a new dog.

Both times the owner comes up after like 30 seconds and grabs the dog, and both times the dog has managed to break away from its owner to come back to my patio door and harass my dog. The second time happened earlier today. I happened to see the owner while I was walking my dog about 20 minutes later, his dog nowhere in sight, and casually asked if his dog *was* outside because I would take mine back inside for her safety.

He said no and I was relieved. Then I asked if he needed a leash or harness for his dog because I knew I had a spare that would probably fit his dog. The guy got defensive and said, ""I don't need none of that for my dog, he's fine off leash."" I really didn't want to argue, so all I did was point to the sign about 'keeping your dog on a leash at all times' and said if his dog was going to keep harassing my dog while she's in her own home that I could get the property manager involved.

My friend “Aubrey” is a bridesmaid. Aubrey has heavy psoriasis and is self conscious about it. She’s wearing a long sleeved dress in the wedding, by her own request. At the time, the only visible places were her arms and legs.

In recent months, it’s developed on her scalp. She’s had to buy a special shampoo so the patches and flakes don’t show in her hair. Once again, she’s super self conscious. According to her, doing the treatment herself really hurts and makes her feel worse about herself. Her dermatologist prescribed a special shampoo and conditioner that’s supposed to help loosen it so she can brush and comb it out. She does what she can do it doesn’t look too bad, but sometimes she just gives up and the flakes show. They’re big, plaque-like flakes that pop up on her scalp. She wears a lot of hats or hoodies.

The thing is, I wouldn’t have minded her wearing a short sleeve dress and showing her flakes/plaque on her arms and legs as it’s really not an issue. However, because you can’t see the redness, just the flakes, her hair looks unkempt often. It’s her hair, so I don’t care on every other day….except my wedding.

I originally told the girls I don’t care how they do their hair, they don’t have to use my stylist, can do it themselves, even if they don’t do anything special. However, with Aubrey, I feel its  not too much to ask she treats it.

I spoke to my stylist and asked if she knew anyone who could help. She has an associate at her salon that actually specializes in psoriasis on the scalp. She’d be willing to do the treatment on Aubrey’s scalp the day before (giving it time to heal and relax before the wedding).

I spoke with Aubrey and explained the procedure. I said I’d be willing to pay for it. She got super embarrassed and reminded me how much it hurts. I said I understand but that was her doing it. The stylist says she can do it in a way that may hurt a little as it’s removing a decent amount of plaque, but she’ll be gentle. Aubrey told me no, even when I gave her the stylist’s number to talk about it in detail. I tried to be reasonable and said the options were the stylist doing it or Aubrey herself would have to do it. She got really upset and said I’m not a true friend if I can’t accept her as is. She’s now not returning my calls or texts.

Because of his age, he can't get chemo. This new years eve is likely his last. New years eve comes up and usually family members come together. However, things have gotten really bad among us.

I have some family members who think family is really important and should be prioritized over most other things. When plans get made, they want you to be there. Around this time, plans for new years eve usually get made and I'll probably be getting a lot of crap if I choose to go to friends. But I'm used to it. I always either ignore it or will go if I think it's important for me to be there.

Our family used to be very close but a lot of recent events, including my grandpa having terminal cancer, tore our family apart. A lot of mental issues rose up. I now have some aunts and an uncle who became really toxic. Yelling, screaming, crying and recently even stealing from each other. Most of the time for very little things. It makes me not want to be in the same room as those family members.

To give you an idea of how bad it is: I decided to spend my last birthday with family. Even though I was still recovering from neuritis vestibularis, I bought a cake, hopped on a train and went to my grandparents' house, where we gathered. It was misarble. Once in that evening, I went upstairs to lie down because my head was bonking. When I heard screaming downstairs, I went to check it out. They were furious at each other. They kept going for each other's throat, even infront of me. Later, I found out it this was something about and aunt not seeing another aunt or uncle still behind them when closing a door. This mixed with giving a wrong look. It resuled in a yell fest that ended the evening and me going home. At the end of the evening, the aunt that was yelling told me to my face: ''I'm sorry that it happened on your birthday, but I don't regret what I did''.

It only got worse since that day. They hate each other now. I know they want to gather for my grandpa and I want to do it for him, but I know the evening will be absolutely misrable. If I go, I would only go and suck it up for my grandpa. However, I'm considering to now go. I love my grandpa and want to be there for him, but it will be hell.

(Okay, so maybe just a little...) 

Myself and my partner only recently moved into our first place together a few months back. We both work pretty full-on, hectic jobs and the past few months have been absolute non-stop in terms of social life, new ventures and general workloads increasing. 

Both of our families live on opposites sides of the country, so for the past few years we have alternated between houses to try and keep it fair. Neither of us really like the travel (and neither of us really have great families so there is always some kind of tension or debacle each year so it gets stressful just thinking about it.) This year when it was brought up, I suggested we spend our first Christmas here and start our own traditions, seeing as its our first Christmas together in our own place. Plus both of our jobs have been manic lately so it'd be nice to just chill out and relax. (We're both on the edge of burnout.)

Surprisingly, they shot it down, stating that ""people don't really start having Christmas alone together till they have kids.""....?   wtf?

Now, I know they get to take two weeks solid off over the Christmas period, which is fine, they work hard at what they do. But I work in retail and I have to work between the Christmas and New years period, which means I really don't get a break. Work's been absolutely crazy lately, especially in the are I'm in, given the economy right now.  It's a flat-out job, both physically and mentally draining. (I love the job, but staffing issues have made it really stressful and problematic and I've been taking work home more and more just to get it done lately).

I though having a nice and relaxing, cosy holiday together would be nice but they just flat out said that they're not spending it here with just the two of us, that that was silly and they want to spend it either in theirs or my parents.

I'm tired. I am on the verge of a mental burnout and really, really just want to chill out this year and not have to deal with... people.

She also calls me ""the boy who cried wolf"" because I've had so many past issues.

My mom always comes with me to doctors appointments (mostly virtual cause I'm bedbound) and tells them stuff like ""Tuna has a lot of trouble being objective about what is illness in her body and what isn't.""

My dad also told my new GP that ""Did you know that Tuna sees a psychiatrist? and is on Lexapro for anxiety??? Maybe there's a mental health component???""

Basically, doctors never take me seriously because my parents are saying these things. But I don't know whether I'm being unreasonable in NOT wanting my parents to speak about my trauma history to my doctors. 

My mom tells me that ""we have to be honest with the doctors and you are being secretive and hiding things if you don't want us to have an open conversation."" 

Also! The wonderful and amazing Janet Dafoe (someone who's very prominent in the MECFS community) actually took the time to speak to my mom. Apparently during the call, my mom immediately regaled her with a history of my teenage issues (none of which are a problem for me anymore) and told her basically that I have been one problem after another and I can't have MECFS in light of all my earlier trauma. 

The other day, I spoke to an ME/CFS specialist (one of the ones who diagnosed me) over the phone and my mom was VERY reluctant to have me talk to the specialist alone. She gave me only 10 minutes speaking to the specialist before she came into my bedroom and joined the call.

I feel like I'm living in the Twilight Zone. I don't know whether I am being dramatic and making everything up. I'm so confused and feel like I'm losing my mind. I feel kinda like I did when I was in a bad relationship and always doubting myself.

Also - my parents are EXTREMELY intelligent.  They are very convincing, and I.....I have high functioning autism, I'm a young woman with a history of trauma.

They're also not being completely honest with me. They're all telling me one thing and telling each other something else in secret (which I overhear, or read in an email my mom showed me)....

 I know my sleep pattern, so when by 3am I hadn’t fallen asleep I knew if I fell asleep I wouldn’t be up till 12 that afternoon - baby wakes up at 6-7.

So I just didn’t sleep, I did complain to my partner because I can’t have coffee. I mean we had a pretty good day though, we went for a bike ride and fed the ducks, I pushed her on the swing for a little while and then when we got home I took us to my bedroom and put a film on, I must’ve fallen asleep (2 hours at most!) but my room is pretty much empty aside from the bed and tv, child friendly.

I guess my niece mentioned to my sister I’d fallen asleep, I apologised said I hadn’t slept that night and I hadn’t planned on falling asleep.

Sister went off on one about how irresponsible and unsafe that was, how will I cope with a baby etc, she said “I thought you were an adult, do you even think?” And left, my mother has apparently been agreeing with her that it was completely irresponsible and even then I should’ve checked with sister if she was ok if I napped.

Last night she told me that she came up with birthday plans already, she and her best friend are going to go to a very expensive concert that tickets needed to be purchased right away. I was a little bummed when I heard this, I mean, half a year beforehand she's actively excluding me from her birthday celebrations. I tried to keep it to myself because, you know, it's her birthday, she should obviously do what SHE wants on HER birthday.

But I guess my face and change in conversation was kind of revealing, and she asked what's wrong. I tried to skirt it, but eventually I was just honest ""It's a little bit of a bummer to be excluded from your birthday by plan rather than happenstance."" All this immediately turned into that she ""never gets to do what she wants for her birthday"" because she shares a birthday with her sister and they would usually do joint birthdays. I didn't see how this was relevant, I've been with her for some time now and witnessed many a birthday and their usually exactly what she's decided on for that year - i.e. her wanting to spend her birthday with her sister and having to compromise on activities to do so is not the same as ""never getting to do what you want.""

I made it clear I don't expect her to change her plans, I was just a little surprised by what she said and did find it a bit of a bummer. However her reaction has me feeling shitty today and like I might of created a source of tension for the next half year.

I’m (43F) divorced with two teens (15F &amp; 17M) and remarried to my husband (42M). We have the kids every other week. My husband works night shift and we have two dogs, one puppy who is still working on separation anxiety and barks when alone. Probably doesn’t help that I work from home in that regard. But, I keep the dogs occupied during the day, they sleep most of it, and try to keep them quiet so my husband can sleep. My daughter has a lot of appointments, therapy, physical therapy, dermatologist, and random others. She asks me to schedule them and I ask if she wants me or her dad to take her. She always says she wants me to take her.
So here lies the problem. My husband is frustrated that I take her to all of her appointments and never her dad. I’m used to it, he’s an ex for a lot of reasons. That’s mostly the basis, but he also gets frustrated because he is often woken by the dogs when I leave. He’s also diabetic and sometimes needs his insulin or food if he wakes up from a spike or drop while sleeping. It doesn’t seem to be any one of these issues, but a combination that makes him upset that I take my daughter to all of her appointments. 
What gets me thinking is that she’s perfectly happy to have the other house, likely her step mom, take her for her nail appointments or hair appointments or to get her lashes done (which I’m wholeheartedly against at 15, but gotta pick my battles).

The light makes me feel better as I can therefore see who's out there. 

The lack of privacy and my own use of the garage compounded with this text about my light was my breaking point and talked to my landlord. She agreed he shouldn't have more privileges to the property to me, that he wasn't even paying her ""rent"" for the space. She kicked him out of the garage. She said he pulled the same stuff with her regarding the light when she lived in the unit. 

2 weeks ago he sent me another text at 720pm on a Saturday again asking of I intend to have my patio light on when I'm home. Said it lit up his entire backyard and he's extremely light sensitive. 

I didn't reply. 

He texted me again a few nights ago flat out asking me to turn off my outside light at night, for the same reasons. 

He has a 12 foot fence plus hedges around his yard and a second floor with no blinds. 

I texted him the day after and said that I do. I turn off my lights before I go to bed. 

He then persisted the issue asking me what purpose it serves if my blinds are shut (they aren't always), suggested shining a light onto my house or toning down my light. He says if he can't have darkness in his backyard it depresses him. 

I texted that I don't need to justify why I want to have lights on at my house, if there is a light by law I'm unaware of to send it to me. I mentioned he has no window coverings on his second floor and if he is that sensitive to light maybe he should consider some. 

Also told him that I've given notice and he only has to deal with it for a few more weeks. 

The texts kept coming, claiming that I never had that light on before. I'm tired of dealing with this so I got my landlord involved, despite not wanting to cause more drama. 

If he had blinds up, I maybe would have been more empathetic. But instead he's expecting me to turn my lights off at night.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4847205,public,top,self,AITA for not turning off my patio light?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zatuvm/aita_for_not_turning_off_my_patio_light/,all_ads,6,,,,

* hates waking up early
* hates hanging out w/ our friends/other ppl; prevents me from hanging out w/ them

It started around a year ago. My friend, let’s call them Jordan, and I were in a group of friends together. 
One day, the day before my birthday (which Jordan knew), Jordan messages me saying “I left the group chat, can you tell them it’s nothing personal and I just need some space for my mental well-being?” 
I respond saying of course, that I totally support Jordan if they need anything and that working on their self and their health is a priority and that I’m always just a message away if they need. 

I occasionally send Jordan a meme or two to look at. No spamming, literally 2 memes within two months. 

I ask Jordan if they’re planning on going to a certain party; because I haven’t seen them in awhile and I’d like to say hello. I get a message back from Jordan very angrily saying that they wanted nothing to do with me and that I needed to stop talking to them and messaging them. 

I’m sitting here thinking “woah, what the heck did I do to make Jordan hate me so much?” 

I at first just shrugged it off as maybe Jordan just wanted some space. But I kept thinking that if nothing was really wrong, then why would they snap at me like that?

So a few months after that I message them asking “hey, what did I do?” The same response. “Oh you didn’t do anything to me I don’t hate you”

Now I’m just confused at this point. They don’t want to talk, but they don’t hate me, but they want nothing to do with me…

Now I’m very much a person who cares a lot, and it can come across as pushy. But I’m also very sensitive when it comes to things.

Now Jordan also has a few other friends, some of which I’ve been chatting with because they are nice (not because they’re Jordan’s friends, but because they have the same interests that I do). However, Jordan’s friends have been giving me the vibe that they don’t really like me, so I figured Jordan said something to them (whether it be through a rant or whatever). 

It got to the point where every time I tried to participate in a discussion with Jordan’s friends (and a few others), I just felt so shitty because I didn’t feel included in the conversations nor did I feel like they enjoyed my presence. 

So I message Jordan saying to stop saying bad things about me to others because according to them there was no issue in the first place, so why talk bad? 

Jordan responds calling me immature for assuming that they’re talking bad, and that they’d never say anything because there’s nothing to say. 

I then apologized for assuming and tried to explain why I thought this, but they blocked me after my next message. Basically calling me selfish and immature for thinking they’re a bully, and would appreciate if I didn’t assume they were talking about me.

He lives with my sibling and his gf (25f). 

Everything has always been fine. I never really cared about the age gap and I don't think that is relevant to this situation.

We watched TV together for a bit but my dad and his gf were mostly cooking or just not in the living room. They've been doing that a lot, but my dad has done that my whole life so I didn't really think much of it. 

Anyway, after a bit GF comes out and starts getting angry and yelling at us because we haven't done enough to make her son feel welcome and that he didn't want to come over. 

The child was not there yet. I have never fully understood the custody arrangement and never really felt it was my business. 

I have met this child a handful of times and always been nice to him, but I never really planned on seeing either of them outside the context of my dad. I also only really go over once a month because I work a lot and weekends are for me and my husband.

She continued yelling at us and then my dad joined in. He has never screamed at me like that before. 

During the yelling I was pretty shaken and confused, but every time I asked what they could do my dad brought up other kids I had babysat in the past. My bestie's nephew was with her a lot and I lived with her. He brought up another child that again I met a few times.

My dad really laid into my sibling because her son really looks up to them. My sibling is a cool music kid and very much into their own thing, which I feel is the age to be that way.

My (26F) very best friend (27F) in the entire world has been “dating” an incredibly toxic guy (31M) for about 3-4 years now. Initially, he was her stalker. He couldn’t handle that she didn’t want to be exclusive with him, so he would find her location through mutual friends, appear in public wherever she was, and throw very public, pitiful temper tantrums begging her to date him. He purchased all of her drinks and then would lure her back to his place to sleep with him. He threatened to take his life if she stopped seeing him. There was a point where she nearly had to file a restraining order.

I spent about a year and a half of my life consoling her because she painted things to me as if she desperately wanted to get away from him. I offered my home up to her as a place of refuge, offered many words of encouragement, support and advice, offered to financially assist her, offered my boyfriend as a physical presence if things became unsafe, and much more. My support for her was so intense that it even affected my own relationship.

We had a major falling out. I was not only extremely frustrated that she was being disingenuous with me, but she started lashing out at me for pointing out that she was spending more time with him than me, and that our friendship was fading because of it. She told me that I was being unreasonable and possessive. (huh?)

We eventually rekindled things and I realized that it wasn’t my place to attempt to dictate who she sleeps with, or tell her how to handle her relationships and choices. I let A LOT go. She apologized sincerely and has since made effort to dedicate more time to our friendship. She is transparent about the fact that she needs to eventually break things off with him. The juicy part is, she’s now pregnant by this asshole.

My hangup is this, which brings me to the purpose of my post. She insists on bringing him F*CKING EVERYWHERE. They are surgically attached at the hip, meaning that I essentially can’t hang out with her without hanging out with them both. I think I am justified in my distaste with this dude, and she is clear about how I feel, yet she refuses to draw a boundary and ask him to stay home. I have vocalized my frustration to her many times, which she claims to understand, yet continues to bring him along. She is now growing increasingly frustrated with me for being vocal about this issue.

AITA for not wanting to hang out with them as a couple? Is my distaste for him justified, or an overreaction? This girl is my best friend in the world and soon to be maid of honor. She is an angel on earth, with the exception of this shitty dude’s influence. I just want my friend back, and don’t know if I’m in the wrong.

Little did I know that she had actually gotten through the line and was about to pay for the ticket IN THE FRONT! Saw my message and cancelled the ticket! 😭😭

As soon as she told me I told her to quickly check again because the website holds the ticket for you for 10mins but she said that it was cancelled already. 

Now, I have both tickets, I didn’t refund it or anything but…I feel so bad, only if I hadn’t texted her, she’d get it too. I am looking everywhere for resales so I can get it for her.

We had a great time together. There were moneyboxes for a wide range of charities (about 20? 30? if I remember correctly) at the church and I ended up using up all my coins!

Fast forward to now and the festival is on again for the first few days of December, including tomorrow. Grandma, Mum and I all wanted to go, but Grandma is not feeling well and told Mum we should go along without her. The plan is now for Mum and I to go to the festival just us two, buy a present for Grandma there and stop by Grandma's house on the way back to give her that present.

Earlier this afternoon, I was sorting out the coins I was going to put in the moneyboxes at the festival. I should probably mention that I have autism spectrum disorder and anxiety which makes me unable to work or live independently, even though I would love to have a job and maybe my own place. Since the start of the pandemic, my dad has been the one doing the majority of the shopping (to limit the number of people leaving the house) and he has preferred to keep it that way, so I have a fair amount of benefit money I don't have much use for. I figured it would be good to give some of it to those in need via the charities at the festival. Some of my money is kept in a mug, which I emptied onto the table before putting the £1, £2 and 50p coins into my wallet to take with me to the festival, and the other coins (1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p) back into the mug. As I was doing this, Dad walked into the room and I told him what I was doing when he asked ""What are you up to?"" He thought I was putting all the lesser-value coins into my wallet and I corrected him, saying I was taking the £2s etc. with me.

He told me I should be taking the lesser-value coins with me as ""that's what normal people do, they put in pennies instead of pounds"" and ""the money will end up in the hands of the administration rather than with the people who need it"" and that I shouldn't give too much away as I ""won't have enough left for myself"" (bear in mind, there is also at least £200 of banknotes I left in the mug, plus all the money I have in my bank account for when I order something online). I got annoyed at him trying to tell me what to do with my money but didn't want to argue so I didn't respond, but he kept pushing for me to answer him so I just said I'm taking with me what I'm putting in my wallet. I walked off back to my room and he said ""I'm just trying to teach you how the world works"", to which I responded ""No, you're trying to tell me what to do"". When Mum came home from work later, I overheard him telling her what I had done and she groaned about it, as if to say ""oh, for goodness' sake"" in agreement with him.

When my wife was applying for college, her parents told her that they would help pay for her loans and she shouldn’t worry about it, so she took loans out believing they would help cover the cost. This was my understanding when we got married. When we got married, she was in graduate school so her loans were in deferment and we didn’t know how much the monthly cost would be. I figured they’d be similar to my monthly loan payment (which is reasonable) and I was sadly mistaken.

She has a job but apparently doesn’t make enough to cover her expenses and loan payments…allegedly.

I tried to keep it to myself because, you know, it's her birthday, she should obviously do what SHE wants on HER birthday.

But I guess my face and change in conversation was kind of revealing, and she asked what's wrong. I tried to skirt it, but eventually I was just honest ""It's a little bit of a bummer to be excluded from your birthday by plan rather than happenstance."" All this immediately turned into that she ""never gets to do what she wants for her birthday"" because she shares a birthday with her sister and they would usually do joint birthdays. I didn't see how this was relevant, I've been with her for some time now and witnessed many a birthday and their usually exactly what she's decided on for that year - i.e. her wanting to spend her birthday with her sister and having to compromise on activities to do so is not the same as ""never getting to do what you want.""

I made it clear I don't expect her to change her plans, I was just a little surprised by what she said and did find it a bit of a bummer. However her reaction has me feeling shitty today and like I might of created a source of tension for the next half year.

I (f54) was recently divorced.  I joined a dating app and met a guy.  His (m44) profile said he’s single with no kids but doesn’t have a picture due to his job.  We match, he tells me he is in law enforcement and we find things in common.  We agree to meet. 

We meet for drinks near my home and chat for a few hours.  There is chemistry.  Tells me he broke up with his gf of 6 years 4 months prior.  We chat again and it gets steamy.  So we agree to meet more privately.  I offer to go to his place but he said it’s a bachelor pad and he’s embarrassed for me to see it.  Mind you, we had talked back and forth via text for hours on end on a daily basis.

He comes over, we have amazing sex.  Two days later he tells me he has to take an undercover assignment and can’t have contact (I know, I know).  I even teased him that he didn’t have to make up an elaborate lie to get rid of me.  He stops by the day he is supposed to leave and we have sex again.  

I don’t hear from him for 3 weeks, then out of the blue he says he’ll be in town to give a report and can we meet.  You know the drill.  At this time, I’ve started having feelings.  He says he won’t be back til the end of the month.  Boom, never hear from him.  

I’m thinking I did something wrong and wondering why I’m not hearing from him.  I’m downtown one day and looked at my app opened his profile and it said he was 2 miles away.  I do a reverse image lookup.  Come to find out, he’s not a cop, he is married, has 2 kids and a wife.

I thought it would be great but the first week we moved in, one of my roommates (we’ll call her Paisley) became controlling about what rules we had in the apartment and where things could go. She told us that certain kitchen appliances of ours could not be in the kitchen because she needed space for her stuff. I understood, she has the right to lay down rules and organize things how she wants but it was getting on my nerves a bit 

Paisley had a boyfriend. every time this boyfriend came over, he would make a comment about how our apartment did not look clean or about how other roommate was stupid or lazy. this hit at a big insecurity for her because this particular roommate has ADHD and works extremely hard to be able to keep up with cleaning and school work. 

because of this, i told paisley that she could have her boyfriend over but he needed to either watch what he says or stay in her room the entire time. she was actually very respectful of this and the issues with him subsided

fast forward a couple months and she tells me she is going to move in with her boyfriend next year. she said it was because she could not handle the mess that my other roommate was leaving. i left it at that and assumed she would tell the other roommate so that we could begin looking for a new roommate. 2 months have gone by and she still hasn’t said anything. i had to be the one to tell her. 

throughout these 3 months she spends 90% of our time together making snide marks about our other roommate behind her back, constantly talking shit about her and trying to convince me to move out. eventually the shit talking became too much and i told OR about the situation. this causes a riff in the friendship with them and eventually both of us pulled away from that relationship and spent more time just the 2 of us. 

this sent paisley into a dark depression (apparently) so she decided to talk to not one, not 2 but 3 of our mutual friends about the situation without our knowledge or any way to defend ourselves. this upset me a lot because i did not want my reputation to be ruined for something that is simply not my fault. i don’t owe my time or attention to anyone and just because im not talking to you does not make me a bad person.

long story short, i found out who she had been talking to because one of those friends approached me about the situation. this led me to talk to paisley and confront her about going to my friends about something that had absolutely nothing to do with them. i made sure to talk about the situation with peje that did not know her so that her reputation was not ruined. this led her to say “i will not apologize for talking to my friends because i was living in an unsafe environment”

BG: The unit is 4be/2ba. I was assured that only two people would be sharing a bathroom. I’ve always been particular about that and I like to keep it clean + expect a reasonable level of cleanliness from others (eg cleaning out 💩 stains in the toilet, no pee on the seat). The roommates are randomly assigned.

My bathroom-mate and I both kept the entire apartment and our shared bathroom clean. He has partially moved out but his lease is still remaining so I have the bathroom to myself atm. He can back up my claims.

About 2 months in, 2 new people moved in (mid-20s M) (A and B) who would be sharing the other bathroom. Right off the bat, there were a lot of issues. 

\- Dishes would be left in the sink/dishwasher

\- Stove and countertops are left dirty

\- A used my personal cookware to cook and would not clean it for some time. 

\- We had only 1 fork that A left dirty in the sink

(for reference this is all provided by the building)

\- Out of the 6 glasses, B always uses 4 at once and A the rest.

\- I’ve told them repeatedly we have roach infestations.

I politely asked A to do the dishes after at least 2 days, (2 times A has been out for 4 days with dirty dishes left behind). B once left dishes in the dishwasher for 10 days because he saw a roach in there. I had to ask him to take the dishes out. 

The bathrooms are cleaned twice a month. A once left the bathroom dirty causing B to use my bathroom. He never(which, here, understandable) but his entire attitude regarding- as if he was entitled to use it. I didn’t say anything despite being uncomfortable. He made it a habit to use it on-off.

B once used my bathroom and didn’t flush. I politely said that he hadn’t flushed and he didn’t even apologize. I requested B not use my bathroom unless necessary. He was very rude after this.

It was brought up again, B apologized before saying that he will continue using my bathroom, that anyone can use any of the bathrooms, which I told him was not true. He didn’t concede and he said he ‘doesn’t care’ and will do what he needs to. There was more I don’t recall because I was frustrated and trying to be polite instead of being bitchy because of his attitude

I overheard A and B talking about me and how I’m constantly “complaining” (the complaining is asking them to clean up THEIR dishes and put them away) and basically just laughing at me/the entire thing and talking about how I ‘need to chill’

We had a fight with Simon's sister (Rebecca 30) over a matter.
So Simon has a smaller brother - Andy.
Andy is finishing final year of high school and is going for a vacation after. We live inland and Andy will head off to the coast with his girlfriend and friends.
So earlier this week we were told that we had to drop off Andy and his girlfriend at the bus station at 3 on Sunday. Rebecca already bought the tickets. That's fine until we learnt where the bus station is. It's in town in a rather shady area. 
Then when we made a fuss about it, we were then told that we are overreacting and making everyone scared. This arrangement was made a while back but then me and Simon were only told on Tuesday to drop Andy off on Sunday. Simon is working till 2 on Sunday in the other side of town. So that basically means I need to be involved.
When Simon confronted Rebecca she then says no Simon is acting on emotions and that I'm overreacting. Simon called her and she essentially dropped the phone without giving him a chance to say anything quoting a big sister you don't talk to me if you're angry thing.
If they gave us some heads up we would have been fine to chip in together to get Andy plane tickets. But right now it's too short notice to get affordable plane tickets.
My point is Rebecca says it's not that bad but then refuses to drive there because she doesn't feel safe. But then... its okay for us to drop Andy off there??? Rebecca keeps insisting that it's not her responsibility and that it's Andy's fault.
Andy is no Saint either. He keeps springing us last minute plans and gives us no choice to react.

This was a pretty last minute decision as I'd spent the last year basically raving about how I was so excited to go to college abroad and start a new life. I was accepted into all the colleges I applied to, except for the ones in my home country.

For some backstory, I've struggled with a lot of depression and anxiety in my life and can admit that I'm incredibly terrified of change. When the deadlines for acceptance were coming up, it started hitting me that I would have to uproot my entire life and start again somewhere else. During that time, I was medicated for my anxiety so I could get through final exams and all in all, was a very fragile individual. I began to understand the enormity of moving away to college in a European country where I didn't even speak the language fluently. So, I decided to decline my acceptance and told my parents.

They're input was basically that I was being rash and unreasonable. They think if you can do something now, you shouldn't put it off because it would be a massive waste of time that you can never get back. I countered this by telling them all the plans I 

had for the year so that it wouldn't go to waste. I was taking up an online coding course, getting a part time job, learning a language, and writing and publishing a book. I also gave them a realistic time frame for all these projects. They then told me that they were planning on selling the house and that if I didn't move out, they would be stuck with the house for another year until I left and by then, the housing market will have crashed and they wouldn't be able to sell again for 10-15 years. Keep in mind, my two older brothers have their own housing, one is in a full time job and the other is almost graduated from university, so they're both set, and selling the house wouldn't really affect them at all.

5 months later, I'm doing all the things I said, but now, my mom is trying to get funding for chemo and my dad is settling his business for when they leave. I can tell they want to speedrun the whole thing, that I'm in their way. They don't know where I'll go when they sell the house and they want me to come with them, but like I said, I'm not ready for a change like that yet and I want to stay in the country until I go to college next year. If they don't sell the house soon, they probably won't be able to afford my mom's chemo, as well as my college tuition next year.

On the other hand, I know that my decision was right for me. I'm in a much better place than I was 5 months ago and I'm actively working towards my dream career now. I don't even care if I can't live in this house for another year, I can always get accommodation somewhere else, but my parents don't want me out on my own if I'm not in school.

Background: My mom married and got pregnant super young and when my dad ""went out to buy milk lol"", my mom looked for care on my grandpas and they took her in for some months until my mom found out my grandpa was cheating on my grandma, and my mom told her. My grandma thrown my mom out to the street because she was angry she find out lol. From there my mom and I were all alone. 
We are only two grandchildren in the family. 
My cousin, ""J"" (18M) and me (24F). We live in different counties.
Last Xmas we were all together for first time in 8 years, it went downhill after we were playing a family game and J started laughing as his dad because he was losing and his dad started accusing us of  teaaching J bad manners. I got up and left and my mom followed me. It's typical of my uncle to throw tantrums when he's losing a game and my family normally just go with it, and he doesn't even apologize.

When J and his fam moved to country A, my grandpas started visiting us more and after my mom moved to country C, my grandma decided to be closest to me.
Well, J's high-school graduation is tomorrow and so it's my birthday, my whole family (except my mom and me) were invited. As my family has to travel to another country to celebrate J graduation I asked them if they could come to my city a little sooner and celebrate my bday with me, specially cause this is the first bday that I'll be spending all alone and considering that they are obliged to come to my city as the cities were they live do not have an airport thought it was a good idea. They said the couldn't and gave generic excuses. 

This is only one of the similar things they have done with me when my cousin and his dad are around. They have done if since I got memory 

I'm honestly super tired of feeling like I'm just consider part of the family when my cousin is not there. I'm tired of being just the replacement of someone. In thinking on going LC with them but some friends said that my fam has been there for me so ill be an as* if I fo that to them.

I’m a mom, 42.  I have a college aged son who has also started doing some modeling for extra cash at school. I am fully supportive of him and all of his decisions, no issues there. 

He posed for a recent project in the nude. Again, it’s art, I have no problems with it. A few if the shots have been highlighted in the photographer’s portfolio online and even in her studio, so it’s a cool accomplishment for him. They are getting some attention in the art community, evidently - the photographer is very talented. 

The thing is, I feel weirdly conflicted about looking at the photos! I haven’t seen them, I am just up in my head about whether it’s appropriate or weird or whatever for me to see my son in that light. Two of my friends have seen them and said they look great, he looks great, and that I’m being uptight about this. One friend in particular has challenged me for not being as supportive of my son as I could be.

I’m proud of her.

Excuse my grammar, English isn’t my first language.

Meghan trainor released a song called “made you look” and my daughter loves this song, I recorded her doing a little dance to it.

Another hobby of my daughters is gymnastics, we’re looking into classes but right now it’s just the splits and backflips - she’s 7 she thinks the splits are “*the coolest*” 

So while dancing to this song she’s doing the splits etc, I found it funny.

She asked me to send it to some family, so I sent it to my parents and aunt.

Aunt responded; “** Bit mature.. looks like a stripper.  Funny not funny.  X**”

What does that even mean? It’s not the first time she’s made comments about my daughter being grown up/too much, it’s annoying and I do take it as criticism and I don’t think that comment is suitable for a 7 year old - **nobody encourages my daughter to dance the way she did, me and my partner joke she’s like a teen already, but it’s 100% her**

So I just blocked her, I’ve told her before I don’t appreciate comments and even if I didn’t who says that about a child? She also makes comments about my eldest (9) being too shy/reserved, so it’s like I can’t win? They can’t win.

Anyway my parents asked me to unblock her it’s just her age showing, I should ignore these comments/they don’t hurt anyone, my child doesn’t know about them etc.

It is making family life difficult because obviously Christmas is coming and we do this huge family thing and it’ll be tense if she’s still blocked.

I’ve been an international student in the US for 6 years. I don’t have a big income by any means, I survive off the stipend of a graduate student. 

Growing up our parents worked a lot, and OB left home when he was 14 cause my parents sent him to live with our aunt so that he could get better schooling. OB was never the brightest student academically so my parents felt like he needed the extra help. So I basically had to raise YB (cook, clean, homework, etc.). Him and I are very close and the kid idolizes me. So every time I’ve had the chance to go home I always got him expensive presents, even if I didn’t get any for anyone else.

OB is not very good with money. When I was in my undergrad he was getting his masters in the UK. And he told my parents that he couldn’t work cause then he couldn’t focus on his studies. So my parents just helped him and told me to figure it out by myself cause he needs it more. I guess I’ve always held a grudge against him because he always got the help and I never did. 

Fast forward to this year, my parents wanted to come visit me during the summer (their first time in the US), and I demanded they bring YB. They said they couldn’t afford it, so I offered to pay for his entire trip (cost me $2k+). OB emigrated to Australia in July and is working at a grocery store, while trying to find a job in his field (accounting). In October OB DM’d me saying that his landlord was gonna sell the property and it was getting demolished and he needed to move out. He wanted me to loan him 2k AUD cause he needed to pay movers and pay security deposit. Reluctantly I agreed, cause he was in a new country and didn’t know anybody and I wasn’t gonna let my brother go homeless. I told him that I absolutely needed the money back by Dec 1st, and he agreed . I also purchased a car in the beginning of the year, and after paying for YB’s trip and loaning OB the money I was in fairly tight (not dire) position financially. 

On Nov 27, OB texted me if he could pay me back mid Jan cause he couldn’t gather the whole thing (I was adamant I didn’t want installments cause it’s messy and hard to keep track of it). I kinda snapped and told him that I didn’t care and I need the money back Dec 1, and how he would would get it to me is his problem. He got very quiet and paid me back in full on Dec 1st. I got to to know that he loaned money from some guy that is gonna be charging him a lot of interest. I feel really guilty cause I didn’t really NEED the money back, but I hate it when people don’t keep their word and don’t respect boundaries. In my culture it’s also very disrespectful to talk to your elders that way. And I know he is struggling to make a life for himself in a new country and maybe I should have been more flexible?

Of course I've been cooking for myself, lots! But I don't have the time to learn more as I'm REALLY busy with college. I can't order takeout or drive anywhere because I'm far from food places. I can't keep cooking the same things for myself as they're not entirely healthy, and I'm not good at it at all..

My parents never had a problem with cooking for me until now. My mom is often angry at me recently (I have no idea why) and now says ""why should we cook for you? You're 20"". They have no problem with cooking for the entire family, but they keep excluding me... I am busy with college, my bus is constantly fucking up so I have to catch up at home all day and I have exams now soon. I have no energy because I haven't been getting food.

Im 27F and my friend is Kyle and he is 28. This happened when Kyle was hanging out with me and our other friend Mary (28F). 

Kyle Mary and I went to highschool together and remain close. This happened when we were out for a couple of drinks and Kyle was once again upset about his dating life. We all share this type of information with eachother and ask for advice. So don’t think it’s always Kyle complaining. Mary and I complain too. 

We try to help Kyle and boost his self esteem. He thinks he’s overweight and ugly which is why he’s struggling so much with dating. He’s a little bit bigger of a guy but in no way is he fat and ugly. I know skin and bones is considered the “hot” guy nowadays and he’s not that, but he should be able to get a pretty girl based on his looks. 

He’s gone on dates with teachers, financial consultants, accountants etc and he says he never gets a second date even though he thinks the first one goes okay. He asked for our honest opinion. Mary told him that maybe he’s coming on too strong or just happened to meet all big bitches and it’s not his fault. 

He again tried to claim it’s his looks and I told him to stop thinking he’s ugly. I told him my honest opinion and I wanna know if I was an asshole for this. I told him that the women who he’s gone out with probably are turned off by the fact that he works as a cashier at a marijuana dispensary. 

I know my parents would probably ask what the hell I was doing if I told them I was dating someone who works at a weed store. So maybe they hear about his job and think he’s a loser (I did not say that to Kyle, but I thought it). 

He got very upset and questioned why I’d even say that. I just said he asked me to be honest and I gave him honesty. A lot of my other friends in professional positions wouldn’t want to date a guy who does that regardless of how hot he is. 

I told him that they probably think 2 things when hearing this info. Like if we date long term and have a future, 1.) does he have a marijuana problem? 2.) will I have to be the main breadwinner? I told him to reconsider going to school and look for other employment. He thinks I’m wrong in every which way.

So for little context: 

• Parents divorced since i was seven and sister four. 
• Dad got a new gf pretty quickly and i’m not as close as my sister. 
• Now, I’m 15 and sister is 12 

I’ll go to the weeknd‘s concert when he’s in town with a friend. We got two tickets for 90€ each so 180€ in total. I don’t work bc i’m too young and i have some important exams to focuse on but i went with a friends dog out and got money for it earlier this year. 

Yesterday I told my sister that i got tickets and asked if she wants pictures and recordings. She then replied that she will go to the concert too with my dads gf. See, i have a problem with how she gets everything paid and done for her. I asked my dad about it and he replied that he’s not involved in it. So now i feel like i should get some money for it too because my sister will pay nothing for it and i pay 90€ 

Some important informations: 

Sister gets nike hoodies and jeans as just random gifts. One hoodie costs like 30-40€. She gets nike shoes and football clothings all the time. I don’t get anything except food. 

She also went on vacation with dads gf and her mom for like a week or so. My dad and i will have small trip probably so that’s not the main issue. 

My sister also started playing football, or soccer however you call it, a year ago. Since then my dad and gf attended EVERY training and game day. they are like 3-4 days where they go to see her play football because of it. My sister don’t want my mom see her play. When i had dancing my mom attended almost every dance occurs. Dad went a few times with me but was never focused at any of my hobbies like he’s at my sisters.

I was a nanny to his nephew and his caretaker. I fell in love with my partner, but he said we couldn't marry because he was poor. My partner comes from a very conservative and old-fashioned family. Before his nephew was born, my partner was next in line for an inheritance from a relative. Unfortunately, the nephew was born. All the inheritance was now meant for him!!! 

I felt terrible, because my partner refused to marry me due to his broke status. He said he was not good enough for me, and he was sorry. He continued to give me mixed signals, and our relationship broke apart.

However, I was determined to marry the love of my life. He was the one man that made me feel important. He made me feel heard, and loved. I would do **anything** for him. And it just so happened that an opportunity presented itself.

While I was looking after the nephew, (I was still the nanny at the time) we went to the beach. He said he wanted to swim to the rock in the water. I knew the currents were strong, and he was always a poor swimmer. He continued to whine and my ears started hurting from his stupidly high pitched voice. At this moment, I realized how much I despised him. If it weren't for this dumb child, I would be happily married with *my* partner!!

""Please let me go to the rock!!"" his whiny, ugly screeched. 

The opportunity simply arose, so I took it.

""How about this? I'll let you swim there and you can surprise your mom by waving to her on the rock!"" I enthusiastically said.

The demon child smiled at me and rushed to the water.

It was not my fault.

The water was simply too strong.

I swam after him, too.

I was just too late.

We decided not to tell my dad and would save our way gradually to it. That money was the minimum balance amount of my account that my dad paid for. 

Initially I didn’t press her at all for her share as money often causes a rift between friends and it was frankly not worth losing her but I never specifically said that I don’t need her money at all. I always maintained that we’ll do it eventually and she shouldn’t pressurize herself.

Then came July and my dad asked to see my account, so I had to come forward. Suffice to say he was extremely mad at me for being this irresponsible. I then told her of this and asked to hurry up a notch. It is also at this time that I realized that she’s been on two trekking trips and going to expensive cafes and partying almost every weekend but whenever we spoke about it she was “running low” and “ haven’t received my salary yet”. We briefly argued about it and she boldly stated that she’ll pay the full amount in August. Yes, she was unemployed in April and May but got a better job later on. It used to break me but I always hoped that she’ll pay. I on the other hand had my account blocked for a while, had my credit score sink and didn’t party and shopped due to the extreme guilt until July. I am still living a bit miserly.

In August she paid $50 to my account but since it would have been hard for me to manage this apart from my living expenses, I gave her the money back and asked her to save it in parts and later send me the whole thing. She agreed

Then October came and she bought the iphone 12 on EMI and I was fuming but didn’t say anything. Meanwhile I had saved up $90 by heavy budgeting my hostel expenses. I had received a flight delay compensation of 300 euros in November which was due since August and she knew that I’ll be able to afford it then but the airlines took till November. I told her that I have received it and asked her to hurry up a notch. She keeps saying that she hasn’t received her November salary and she will. 

Today my parents asked about her share and I told them that she’ll do it once she receives her salary and my dad jokingly said that she doesn’t intend to and it has been 10 months. I have been listening to similar taunts by my boyfriend too about her and finally confronted her about it. Needless to say, she is extremely pissed and tells me that I only just asked in July and has stopped responding to my texts. So AITA?

I am doing my masters and my parents pay for it and my expenses, and she works and earns around $600 per month.

I’m a college student. My laptop broke, but I have an IPad that I use to take notes during lectures and study. At the beginning of the school year I decided to purchase a bluetooth keyboard because I found very unpractical to type notes on the screen, also because I need to type very fast to write down the important things the professors say. I didn’t not have much money to spend on that, so when I found a second hand Logitech keyboard on amazon I purchased it, and I’m very happy with it because it was basically new but incredibly affordable. 
Now I guess someone can find it quite loud, louder than a flat keyboard or a laptop keyboard, not as loud as a mechanical keyboard, but as I said, I also type very fast. Some classmates told me they found it a bit annoying, but that they eventually got used to it. A couple of times people told me they had to change seat because they found the clicking sound too annoying and they could not stand it, but others, when I asked if I was bothering them, told me they didn’t mind. Today I noticed that a girl sitting next to me was not able to concentrate during the lecture, and I think it was because of my keyboard since se moved seat later.

I've known K since the start of the year and only met R recently). R is diagnosed autistic, K very likely is but her referral was halted because of COVID.

Today K approached me in tears because she said R had mocked her grandad (who died recently) and made fun of the cat toy she carries around as a comfort item. She also said R stole another girl's plush fox (which went missing the day before). I sent her to support, where another teacher took her to tell the head of year. Meanwhile, I ran into R and asked if she had the toy or saw anyone with it. She said no and I told her I believed her. K remains convinced it was her.

At lunch, I caught up with K, who was still very upset. R and her friends came down the hall, and they started mocking K. R called her toy ""stupid"". I told R she was being mean. R's friends began laughing at K, causing her to hide behind her friend. I told R quietly that she was being mean. R responded, ""look she's hiding from me, she's scared of Black people"".  I tried to remain calm and told her we should try to sort out the situation before making accusations. Another teacher who knows R better than I do came to speak to her and her friends. I gave a brief description of what happened, and the other teacher said the same as I did.

It was only after the other teacher took over I realised how badly I reacted. The way R said it, plus her and her friends laughing at K, made it feel like they were picking on her, but now I feel like I was playing favourites and believing a white pupil over a Black one. As I said, I barely know R beyond what's in her file. I am considering passing R's comment on to HoY.

Im a 21y girl and have a 22y m bf and 21y m roommate. Neither of them get the shared stuff for the apartment unless they’re the last to use it and they need it asap. Including toilet paper and dishwasher detergent. And I’ve been asking for dishwasher detergent for over a week cause we are about to run out. And the roommate keeps asking me for my laptop charger to borrow. He never keeps it longer than a few hours, but he’s been borrowing it all semester. Last night when he texted me after I was already asleep saying he’d need it when he got home at midnight, of course I couldn’t give it to him cause I was asleep and didn’t see it. This morning when I saw it he was already gone, I responded asking if he’d be able to get his own charger for next semester cause I feel like I’m being used for it.
I want to be more stern cause my simple asks from my roommate and sometimes my boyfriend go ignored. 
Our toilet has also been broken (not unable to use, just the handle) for literally months and I told them I put in the first work order and when it broke I was busy and asked if they could put the work order in. So it’s been broken for months cause neither of them will email.

I have two children from my previous relationship, 5 and 8 years old, and I have always struggled with keeping a pristine home.

My partner has been getting upset because I am at home all day and I don't keep the place spotless. They won't say that directly, but I can tell from their body language and behavior towards me that they are upset.

I try, really hard, I struggle though with PTSD and depression due to my upbringing, winter is especially bad for me too since i have a vit D deficiency that exasperates my symptoms. Growing up, we always had a dirty home. Mold in the kitchen, piles of laundry you would have to walk over, PC desks covered in cigarette ash and such. I do NOT keep my home that badly, but it also isn't entirely spotless. This is related though because I was never taught how to upkeep a home. We would just make a mess, get evicted, and move out of the mess and leave it for the landlords to deal with.

I am trying, really hard, to get better habits going but its proven to be harder than I thought. I also though feel like I have 2 small kids, it's not going to be pristine until they learn to clean up after themselves. Which I am trying to teach them, the 8 year old does pretty well, but you can only expect so much from a 5 year old.

I can't help but feel bad and feel like they think I'm an AH. I'm not trying to be, and the weight of this issue is exasperating my depression so I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Am i an AH for this? I don't mean to make it seem like I think they are an AH, they just like a really clean home which is fine. I partially feel like I am an AH, but I also feel like I'm not cause I am sincerely trying. I've been trying to set routines through apps, making lists, start my chores at different times of the day to see if it helps at all. I have changed a few habits now but it doesn't seem like it's enough.

My partner likes to have everything spotless and pristine, and I just don't know how to keep up.

So ! (27M) have a 10.5 F cat who is a living shadow and due to her rough kitten-hood prior to rescue, is only half the size she should be. So, she wears a reflective, glowing collar with a little bell so we can see and locate her in a dark room.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother (47F) has a M cat we took in several years ago but his age in unknown. (We guess he's 8-10.) He's a nice enough cat but he will intentionally run ahead of you JUST to flop over in front of you and trip you or he'll basically sit on your heels so you cannot avoid stepping on him at every turn or every step you take. Also, like every other cat, he enjoys sleeping in dark hallways. (He's a black/grey tabby so hard to see.) I would also like to add that even with the sun coming through the windows and all the lights on, our house is still very dark so the cats NEED the collars.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to get mom's cat a collar like mine and sure enough, almost right away we noticed we tripped over/stepped on him a lot less because we could hear him and see the collar flashing. However, every chance she gets, my mom removes the collars from both the cats; going as far as cutting them off. (The ones I use now are $5 but previously I bought my own cat a $20 leather collar which was intended to be a dog collar that glowed in the dark and came with her name-tag and address.) She says ""The collars are inhumane/stops the cats from breathing right/stops their fur from growing/get in the way of the cats quality of life."" (If you can make sense of this, please do.)

&amp;#x200B;

Right away, mom started screaming at and hitting the cats for being in her way/hidden in shadows so I replaced my own and she left it alone. However, I am putting a collar on her cat several times a day and finding them cut off hours later; sometimes less. She always complains he's in her way/invisible but then says I am ""strangling her cat"" whenever I put a collar on him because you can hear him wheezing from across the room. (He's 20 pounds. It was solid muscle when we adopted him and now it's just fat. He's on a diet and no it's not working. Hence the wheezing.) I assure you that you can slide the collar on and off without undoing it because it stretches some (easier for him and I) so it's NOT choking him and nor is there a reason to cut it off.

&amp;#x200B;

She refuses to keep her cat collared despite the fact that when he IS, we hardly trip over him anymore AND while both cats are outdoor cats (they come in whenever they please but on nice days, they only come in to eat and at night) her cat wanders and is super friendly and will go to anybody who speaks to him. (Mine won't even come to ME most the time and she stays in the yard/close to me.) We've already had to collect him from the pound twice and both times they said ""Please collar him if you cannot afford a microchip!"" On top of that, they said if we have to collect him once more and he's NOT wearing a collar/chipped, they'll just keep the cat ""because clearly she doesn't want him.""
