I do not really have a problem with this. I have a guest suite over my garage. They are welcome to stay there. 

Here is the issue though. Their insurance is rebuilding their home and providing them with funding for temporary housing. But they want to keep the all the money from the insurance. I want to help them but I don't think that is fair. They do not want to pay anything. Not even utilities. 

They think that since ""I am family"" I should not just help house them, but also pay for their electricity, water, heating, and Internet. 

I told them ""NO"" and that if they wanted the suite they could rent it. For cost. And that I would expect all of the money from the Insurance company to go into an account that would cover any damage they did while living with me. 

I think that is fair. But my parents and her in-laws are bugging me to let them move in without anything to cover my butt. basically everyone thinks that  I am being a greedy asshole for trying not to get screwed.

After the event, my boyfriend (19m) called me. He was excited for me and wanted to celebrate with our mutual friend, Holly, and I. He told me his plans of dancing before going to his mentor’s dinner party. I, being a people pleaser, agreed despite feeling terrible.

By the time I got to the agreed upon location, I felt even worse. My boyfriend was not there yet, but Holly (19f) noticed my discomfort. She offered to drive me to her place so I can have a power nap, comfort food and maybe make gingerbread houses if I felt up to it. I eagerly agreed.

Holly let my boyfriend know that plans changed and that we would be having girl time instead. She brought me home, fed me take out and we talked. I felt calm for the first time in weeks.

I was ready to take a nap on her couch while she watched Christmas movies when my boyfriend texted. He was, understandably, pissed off that we left and excluded him. When my boyfriend gets upset, he gets passive aggressive, so he told me that he couldn’t go to the work party anymore. I tried calling him, but he hung up.

I felt terrible for going back on my word, so I told him I’d go to the party. When he picked me up, he refused to talk to me. I tried apologizing but he ignored me, and he did not talk to me unless he had to.

When he dropped me home, I felt distraught but angry. I feel guilty for making him feel so terrible that I deserve the silent treatment. On the other hand, I feel like I was justified.

For context I am not a very social person and go to bed at 9 or 10 every night because I have work early in the morning. My roommate, however, tends to stay up late and is very social. This alone would not be a problem if his guests could keep quiet while they’re here because I am usually trying to sleep and I have issues with sleeping when I can hear voices. I’ve told him this many times and frequently have to ask him to quiet his guests down so I can sleep. This alongside a range of other living differences has made our living situation strained which sucks because we have been friends for 5 years. About a week ago I got home late from visiting my family and just wanted to go to sleep, it was about 1am. My roommate had asked if his coworker could spend the night previously and I had said yes. They come through the door (I’m assuming drunk) as I’m starting to fall asleep and I wait for them to quiet down since they were making noise. It sounded to me like he brought back multiple people and they didn’t quiet down, in fact the coworker started throwing up. This wouldn’t be a big deal if it weren’t for the fact that the bathroom connects to my room through a door and the toilet itself is about 5 feet away from my head, it’s a jack and Jill bathroom. She proceeds to loudly vomit on and off until almost 4 in the morning at which point I texted my roommate telling him “whoever is throwing up needs to go home, I’ll even drive them if need be but this is too much”. The vomiting stopped after that and my roommate did not respond so I went to sleep and didn’t think about it until I heard from a mutual that he (roommate) was complaining about me. Whatever, people are entitled to their opinions. But then I saw that the coworker unadded me from Snapchat so I asked him if he showed her the text and he said that she saw it when he opened his messages at work, also stating that he didn’t see the message until the morning after I sent it. I don’t really believe him and he also keeps inviting this same coworker to spend the night so that she doesn’t have to drive home (30 mins away) between work shifts.

He's probably about 4 years old and has lived with my family for the majority of his life with just a short half year stint living in a different house. This staffy is not very well trained, he barely listens to them, sits under the table begging for food at dinner and jumps all over you, even at your face when you are at his level. But they think this is all fine even though we have told them he needs structure and boundaries for a safe, healthy life.

Anyway, he got into the sheep pen and grabbed a sheep by the leg, the family managed to get him out and technically the sheep died because the family didn't handle the injury properly so it succumbed to infection due to the injury. They decided this wasn't a problem and got a shock collar for the dog so he wouldn't get into the pens again. Fast forward a year or something and he gets into the pen again and this time he bites a sheep around the neck. The sheep survives, luckily because the family actually got a vet in straight away this time. Still fine, did nothing with the dog.

Now, I am fed up due to this latest incident. They have three dogs; The staffy, a rescue which seems to be a mix between a whippet and something else, and a pug x griffin. They went out and left the dogs alone at home, which is completely normal, and when they got back they found the pug x griffin lying on the floor in a pool of his own blood, the blood having been spread all over the floor. The little dog was in shock so they thought he was dead but saw he was still breathing. They took him to the vet and they tried everything they could but the poor thing ultimately died. They knew it was the staffy because when they bathed the dogs, his coat was saturated with blood, the other's was not. This staffy grew up with the pug x griffin from a puppy and they had lived together virtually his whole life. The only time they ever had snaps was at dinner time over food. This was so unexpected and we have no idea why it happened. So what did they do now that the dog has attacked two sheep and killed their family dog? Nothing. They did nothing. They said they didn't want to lose two dogs. I said they should put him down and my wife agrees. They said they wouldn't. So we told them we would not be bringing our little dog over anymore for his safety. It is sad because our little dog also knew the staffy from a puppy and they always enjoyed each other's company but I still have no idea why the dog snapped at the family dog so it doesn't seem safe. They seem to be upset over this and I do not understand why they think they have the right to be upset that I don't want to see my pup's blood staining the floor. The reason I wonder if I'm the asshole is because I know telling someone they should put their dog down is a bit extreme and upsetting so I want to know if I really did come off as an asshole or if it is warranted.

This has caused me a great deal of pain and they have been very aware of that.
Recently, I calmly let them know that it had been too much for me to handle and I was peacefully going my own way and spending my time with people in my life who make the effort to have a mutual effort within our relationship.

Today was my birthday and I got bombard with photos and happy things from years passed.. and I am a very empathetic and loving person.. I usually would on about how ""lucky I am to have a sister/ brother like them"" and ""thank you soo, much""

Instead,!I felt myself only able to muster a ""thanks.”  

..genuinely that's just what I felt.
I didn't want to cause a stir by ignoring them.. and I *do* love them. But I don't want to keep draining myself dry for the zero effort I get in return.

Anyway.. this must’ve freaked them out or something because suddenly they all showed up at my apartment door completely unannounced. Not only was my place a mess and I wasn’t prepared at all for guests.. and they have literally ditched me on times we did have plans and the place was in a condition I was excited and proud to show them.. so then seeing it for the first time in all these years the way it was hurt to think about.

My sister texts “a gift is about to be at your place soon!” .. so I looked out my window and there they are trying to figure out my front gate. So  I lied and texted back “I’m not in the state.. my friend took me to Pennsylvania to get away for a bit for my birthday. I will ask a neighbor to grab it. Thank you.” 

She immediately send back a photo of my apartment and you can tell she’s a little pissed off. Kind of a like “well I tried!” Attitude and I think the point is lost on her.

And at this point their presence isn’t something I want to have to treat like a gift to me.. after having been so coldly abandoned for so long.. they live 40 mins away. And prior to me finally telling myself I’m going to stop going to them to see if they come to me (which was Feb 2020…) I had done things like flew across the country for the weekend for them if they had a special occasion coming up… I would be at their homes for every holiday, birthday, always with gift in hand… always available to talk when they need.. always supporting them.. helping them … but nothing in return.. not even once. 

I had once gone to my sisters home and been turned away because her husband “doesn’t trust me” and judges the way I live my life.

I only agreed and went along with the idea because she was the type that always wanted my hair short and she did not like the idea of me growing my hair out. So her deciding to come up with that idea was a sign that she'd at least learned to respect my choice. Trust me if you knew how much of a piece of work she is then you'd understand why I agreed.

Anyways, it's been a month or so give or take and I had almost completely forgotten about the whole proposition. Until today when she choose to dump it right back on me after I had just finished cleaning her car. She takes me to a woman who knows how to plait hair and that's when things went down hill. Now I figured that my head was going to feel a bit tight due to the braids, but I completely did not expect to feel like my scalp wanted to rip itself off of my skull. I still wanted to give it a shot and figured I could just sleep the headache off when I got home. So I let the woman do her thing, mother pays her and I get to come a little cranky but still kicking.

I take a painkiller, plopped right on my bed and hoped that the pain would subside when I wake up. Some time later I wake up and while my head still felt tight it felt like the pain had finally numbed out. That was until I woke up fully and learned that the headache and pain were still very much there. I looked up how long this stuff is supposed to last and apparently it can last for a couple of days. I had not too long ago took a second painkiller but God this has to be the second to third worst pain I've ever experienced in my life. And I'd accidentally lobbed a piece of my thumb nail off in my teens chopping some vines off the back of our fence.

I really want to give this plait thing a chance and I don't want my mother's money going to waste. But even I don't think I'm mentally strong enough to nurse this constant tightness and headaches for two or three days for it to finally disappear. And I don't want to keep asking my mom for painkillers because without this plait she needs them more than I do whenever her body starts kicking her in the back.

I work in a 24/7 Veterinary ER/ICU. We are one of the few in my area, we see hundreds of people every day - we also employee over 100. I am a FTP and my baby is almost 7 months old. I really haven’t had a problem with the mask mandate being lifted a few months ago, I have enjoyed not having to wear a mask myself. 

However where we live RSV and the flu have just been decimating our community. Several of my coworkers have been calling out. A couple of my coworkers have children who caught RSV, one baby having to even be hospitalized. Unfortunately the pediatric hospitals are filling up and many are having to send pediatric patients to other states because of the high cases of RSV and flu and there not being enough beds. 

This has been weighing on my mind constantly putting me in a state of anxiety. It wasn’t until the other day that I snapped. First I clocked in and i could tell a few of my coworkers were sounding and looking…. Rough. I started working on a patient, and chat with the owner. As I’m getting my history, I look over at her and she is pale in the face, coughing every other word, an extremely hoarse voice, and runny nose. As she’s talking, she adds that she’s been keeping her dog and her boyfriend separated for the time being because her boyfriend currently has the flu and she “didn’t want to pass it on to her dog.” After I leave the exam room, I complain to one of my coworkers that this lady comes into our hospital while she’s obviously sick and doesn’t bother to mask up. We had joked about making her wear a mask and a different coworker butts in, gets defensive and says “you can’t just ask this person to wear a mask. You’re not the boss. That’s not your decision”, I mean just goes on. But she had a point.

I decided to email my boss explaining my concerns and if we could just implement a short term mandate. My boss said it was a good idea (she went into remission from breast cancer a few months prior and We actually had a mask mandate for 2 years.) 

half an hour later we all got notifications that we were starting a mask mandate for every person in the building until December 23rd.

Now a lot of my coworkers are pissed. one even referred to “whoever started this” as a nazi. No one wants to do it, which I get, but the reaction is worse than I thought it would be. I find that no clients would be wearing masks and the front staff would have all of theirs hanging around their chins. I end up having to stop what I’m doing to tell people in the waiting room to wear masks (even though there are multiple signs from the front to back door.) I remind the front desk team to make sure people coming in wear masks and they act annoyed.

I don’t think it’s that’s big of a deal. A lot of people are pissed, but some are glad we’re doing it.

Fast forward a few years, my elder brother comes home and introduces my bully as his fiancée and that she was pregnant, they were getting married. I was so hurt, so were my parents. He threw a fit and said we can’t control who he loves, so I said fine, but I don’t want to interact with her in any form, my mother also said she just doesn’t see herself welcoming the fiancée in her home. He could always come to see them with the child, without her. 

She came and cried and apologised, all about how she changed and is grown up, regrets what she did. Eventually my parents decided to forgive, but I just couldn’t. I told her I understand she is sorry, but I can never get over what she did to me, she stole my childhood, I am left with all these mental health issues, and only getting over an eating disorder, her sorry is not gonna fix any of that. My brother had a huge fit, called me toxic and said  he was cutting me from his life, and when my parents sided with me he decided to cut them off too. 

We had not seen him for seven years when he showed up at my house distraught. Apparently they got married, had the child and three more (twins and one more) 

The marriage soon turned sour. She verbally ab-used and manipulated him, got them into debt with her shopping addiction, and neglected the kids, even though she was supposed to be a stay at home mom and he worked two jobs.

 The last strand was when he found out the first and the last kids are not his, and she was leaving him to go be with their father who she had been in a relationship with throughout their marriage, and now that he came up financially, she didn’t want my in debt brother. 

He was left homeless, no car, lost his job because of depression, and she left the twins (his kids with her) with him. 

I told him I feel for him, but I’d rather just not be involved or even stay in touch again . I can’t get over how he expected me to just shove my hurt aside and play happy family with my bully, and when I didn’t, he cut me out. 

He has been begging to reconcile, and my parents and the rest of the family are with him, saying he lost everything, he needs our support. I am doing very well financially and they want me to not only rekindle our relationship as siblings, but also support him and his kids financially while he gets back on his feet.

At the end of 2021 I was desperate to get a job because I had not been able to get it due to lack of ""experience"" because it would be my first job. My boyfriend had already been working in a small company for 3 months and he recommended me there because he had told me that they were treating him well and the environment was good. I went to the interview and they accepted me immediately, I was surprised when they told me that it would start the next day, we were only 4 employees without counting the management. My first day of work arrived, I was introduced to the staff, and they gave me a tour of the building until they took me to the employee eating area, it was a small table with only 2 chairs behind a bathroom.

At first everything was going well, except for that fact hahaha, I got along with everyone, the workflow was good, I felt efficient. Until there came a point where small attitudes were happening that gave me a red flag. They didn't allow us to talk almost at all in the office, we all had to always be working; It bothered them if we left the office for a moment, even if it was to go to the bathroom; when the power went out in the building they did not allow us to go home even if we spent more than 3 hours without light and without eating; they did not have a microwave to heat up the food, we sometimes had to wait until after our lunch hours for the secretary to heat up the food for us; They promised us raises, improvements and commissions that never came; They spoke to us badly when there was a misunderstanding. 

All this earning a salary well below what any professional would earn, then I was ""promoted"" and was in charge of the area, but something happened that gradually filled the glass; one day I felt so bad while working, I had a fever, my throat hurt, so I asked for the day off the next day, it turns out that I had dengue, I was on leave for a week and when I returned they blamed me for my area things were going badly for him and that I had gone on vacation. 

That's how many things happened until I decided to leave work, I resigned a week in advance. My boyfriend, for his part, had conflicts with our boss's partner because he was a very conflictive person with all the employees and accused him of false things. He decided to leave a month after me and without notice due to an argument with this person in which he was disrespected in front of the other employees.

TLDR my family is so upset and say I ruin Christmas because I’m literally the only one with small kids and I refuse to travel to my grandmothers house (over 2 hours away) on Christmas Day.

I truly don’t know why it’s become such a sticking point.

I (28F) have two nieces (8 &amp; 5) from my sister (38F). They’re my only family, but I’ve never been super close to my sister or our mom (63F), so I’m not super close to the kids. Even less so when I moved 6.5 hours away a few years ago, and they live in the same city. I only see any of them during Christmas, a week over the summer, and one weekend trip close to the girls’ birthdays. They’re good kids, I love them and have fun with them, but we just aren’t that close.

A month ago I asked my sister what the kids wanted for Christmas and she said she was finally relenting on their wish for tablets, but asked if I could get them because both her and mom are tech incompetent, while I’m a software engineer. So I said cool- got a tablet, headphones, and a large squishamallow for each of them. Got good deals all around, so I only spent $125 on each kid.

The problem came up because I also saw one of those “pick a kid off the tree” charities, where you buy gifts for low income children. I had always wanted to participate, and since it’s the first year I’m not a broke grad student, I thought, why not!

Picked a 10 year old girl who wanted books, science kits, and board games. And I don’t know if it’s just because I’m passionate about girls in STEM or also love reading and board games, but I found myself getting so excited to shop for this kid. Ended up getting like 20 presents- a mix of board games, science kits, clothes, a skateboard, brain puzzles, journaling kit, and a bookstore gift card. Took advantage of Thanksgiving deals, spent about $250 for $350 worth of presents.

Well, we share an Amazon account and I guess they saw all the purchases, assumed it was for my nieces, and called to ask. When I explained, they were both so upset with me? They said that they aren’t able to get the kids much this year (both teachers), and if I had that kind of money, I should be spending it on family instead of some random kid I will never know. I hadn’t really thought about the fact that I don't actually know this kid, but retorted that my nieces have three adults buying them gifts, while this kid might only get presents from the charity.

We argued in circles, they accused me of being cold / not really loving my nieces, and hung up in a huff. But have been pestering me about it over text for a week now.

She would go out of her way to be nice to those in the ""popular clique"" in my school. However, at times when she did not try to seek attention from them, she was just my best friend. We were best friends for 2 years already. She seemed to stop trying to be popular and we just hung out.

However, a girl from the clique took interest in Lily and invited her to join them. Lily just left me for them, without a word. I was confused when I couldn't find her at our usual table. She didn't even tell me about leaving. I was heartbroken when I saw her giggling and chatting with them. I heard them talk about me saying I was an idiot, and a dork. Those words came out of Lily herself and I felt betrayed. When we would meet by accident, she would ignore me, and mutter things under her breath. She had changed a lot, her hair was curled, she had the latest gadgets and clothes, and wore makeup. We used to be in the netball club, but she left to join cheerleading. She cut all connections with me and that was when I decided to let her go.

That was about 6 months ago and I found new friends, the ones I knew would not leave me. Then, one day, Lily came to our table. Naturally, most people would like being popular, even me. So, when my friends saw that she was from the popular clique, they gladly invited her to sit down. She acted as if everything had been fine between us and asked to sit with us. Apparently, from the rumors I heard, she had been kicked out from the clique for humilating and making fun of a member or whatever.

I was willing to accept her apology, but I hated that she had to look for an empty corner for us to talk. Why? I was considered a nerd, someone not popular or cool. She didn't want anyone to see her talking to me, it would ruin her image. Regardless, I waited for her to apologize. But guess what, she didn't. She asked me if she could sit at our table for a few days until her clique took her back in. I refused and told her she could find another table. 

She ignored me for a few days. Then, I found her sitting at our table. One of my friends, Sarah told me that she had invited Lily. She sided with her and told me to give her a chance and be her friend again. I'm literally just laying in my bed thinking about it, maybe I should give her another chance?

I(21F) have a group of friends that are all around my age. On of them is a guy(22) that I worked with this past season that has not gotten his driving license yet.

We all tried to explain to him that, in the place we live, it is mandatory to have a driving license and that he can't always count on us for a ride. I mean, it's not a problem if we're going to the same place, but what if he has to go to work or to any other place that we don't?
So we all had a talk with him, even dragging in the fact that the gasoline has an increasing cost, and we all agreed that if by the 1st of December he didn't have his exam scheduled, we would all stop giving him rides. Anywhere.
This was meant to motivate him to study.

He kinda laughed it off and promised us that it wouldn't happen as he was studying everyday and he'd soon schedule an exam.

The 1st of December came and, guess what, he hasn't scheduled his exam, so we did what we promised. It's been four days now since he had to start walking himself around and a few hours ago he snapped calling us s-hitty friends and aholes as it's freezing outside and it wouldn't cost us anything to give him a ride, that he's studying but he's having an hard time focusing because of dyslexia so it's taking him more time.

A bit unsettled by this, I decided to just dm the guy saying that Instagram wouldn't let me see what I had said that cause such a response from him, and he responded with ""You are too lazy to go back and see what you wrote"", so I explained to the guy that I could not see my comments that people had tagged me on in large insta threads.

But to no avail because he just called me lazy again, now I will admit that I lost my cool on him and replied all caps ""I JUST TOLD YOU I CAN'T"" and then proceeded to give an even more detailed explanation on how it was completely out of my power to see what I had commented and that we could've been avoinding that whole ordeal if he had just told me what I had said in that comment section. (At this point he starts using swears, and tho not directed at me he uses them, I then called him dumb for not listening to what I had to say

He then gives the SAME arguments, as if he read everything I had said to him and just chose to say everything opposite or just dismiss it and then proceeded to say that ""I feel bad for your parents"" ""Maybe get a new phone or upload insta again"" and for whatever reason (I guess I was just so unbearably angry at this guy at this point, that I gave him an excrutiating explanation, something that I wouldn't have bothered to do for some internet stranger)

He then says ""Oh I understand, ur fkn lazy get a grip n sort ur shit out if u cant get ur phone to work then don't comment on insta""

Then there is just a bunch of the same old: me giving him explanations and him completly dismissing them and calling me the same things, and then it ends on this note

Him: ""How long is this going to take""

Me: ""Idk, ALL this pointless arguing could've ended if you had just said ('you said this\_\_\_\_\_' ... \~ ""and my response to that is\_\_\_\_\_\_"" ""I told you this Out of my hands, and I can't control instagram""

Him: ""Are you just expecting other people in life to sort out your problems?"" ""sort your phone out""

Since we started dating during the pandemonium, so there are still many friends of mine from back home who he has not met (we started dating in college). 

Now that things are winding down and we are able to travel I have been slowly introducing him to all of my friends. I just have one friend who I’ll call Penny who I just don’t feel comfortable with him meeting. I have known her for almost all of my life as her family is really close with my own. 

In about the last 6 years she has changed a lot and picked up some weird habits. One of them being this weird need to try and “get with” people who are already in a relationship or are just taken. Her and I have talked about this and she has said it has something to do with her own trust issues. She says it’s like she wants to prove that these people who she gets with are really not good people or something. She also has said it helps her own self-esteem just to see if she can get with them.

Since this habit has kicked in, I have distanced myself from her as I am not really comfortable with her actions but I know that at one point my bf will have to meet her as our parents are basically inseparable. The only problem is I don’t want him to and a part of me doesn’t know why. 

I understand why I don’t want her to meet him. She has no issues with her habit encroaching on some of her friends so I get that but I also trust my boyfriend completely (or at least I thought I did). So why should I have issues with this? 

I feel like me saying that it’s only because I don’t want to watch her try to flirt with my boyfriend wouldn’t be the whole truth. I think I do fear that she will try to like stay in touch with him or something… I don’t know, I just feel so weird about it. 

I really do trust my boyfriend and I think some of this might just be my own self-esteem issues.

So for context months ago my (20F) group of 7 friends decided to take a trip to Bali. We booked and organised things months ago. The relavent people are Liz, James, luke and Emily. Im also not that close with Luke and Emily but close with Liz and James
Also important to note that Liz and I are the biggest drinkers and go the hardest where as the others don't drink that much.

Anyway so since booking everything I discovered that I no longer want to be friends with Emily as she made several sexually suggestive comments towards me as well as making me generally uncomfortable. Now I become tense when in the same room so I decided that I would not be hanging out with her during the trip as I can't relax when she's there. I told James and Liz and they agreed they wouldn't either but there were other people going that she could be with so I figured it was fine. I was supposed to be in a room with James and another friend. And Emily was supposed to be in a room with Luke and another friend. However, the problem is the other person in Emily's room had a family emergency shortly before we left and couldn't go. This friend acted like a bridge between Luke and Emily so it was probably very awlward since they were now alone in the room. This didn't affect me decision and I still didn't want to be around her. 

The friend who dipped was virtually Emily's only friend. During the trip James began constantly trying to guilt trip is into hanging out with Luke by saying ""but he's alone with Emily"" knowing I'd sympathise with that. But if we wanted to invite Luke out Emily would follow him around since she didnt really have any friends now. I told him no I won't be doing that but he can go hang with them, as my close friend liz was more than happy to go get fucked up together. Since they wouldn't really want to drink that much anyway we thought they wouldn't want to come. He didn't want to go without us as he's more of an introvert where as Liz and I aren't. He would get mad call us stuff like selfish assholes and storm off. This sort of thing happened a few times. Everytime I told him you can hang out with Luke if you feel bad and Liz and I will go somewhere for a drink. Then he told Liz and I our lying to avoid Emily was ruining his trip. Liz and I were confused bc we'd had a great time and also felt that the constant guilt tripping was putting a damper on our trip. We didn't tell him this tho bc he's sensitive and we knew he'd get mad. So we just didn't argue and he called us assholes again and left.

The whole day had been filled with planning and discussing her divorce from her physically, sexually, and emotionally abusive husband; and strategizing next steps for this new chapter in her life on her own. I’m 36, she’s 32. We continued our discussion when we entered the Uber after we greeted our driver. There was no music playing and he didn’t seem to be a talker, so she and I started talking about how she was going to inform our family about the divorce. We were discussing  reactions different people might have and how to deal with it etc. Eventually, we started talking about our brother who is 50. She said something like “maybe he’ll have some advice because he’s older.” I said, “Well he’s not really great at advice. He hasn’t lived a lot of life. He told me he has no dating advice for his daughter. He’s had the same wife AND job for 30 years.” 

At this, our driver interjected. “My parents have been married for 60 years.”

“Oh, that’s great!” I said, unclear what his point was, but trying to be friendly and see where this was going.

“I’m 36,” he continued, “I have 3 children. My oldest is 19. So when people say not to have children until you’re older, I say well I’m done now. I can do whatever I want.”

“That’s true. That’s amazing.” I replied, still somewhat confused but trying to be affirmative.

“I’m not going to divorce my wife because I’m tired or want a break. That’s not marriage.”

“Yeah, of course not.” 

And then we sat in silence for 15 minutes. 

Am I an asshole for talking in a silent Uber with my sister about shit that was really top of mind that day? Or is this guy an asshole for lecturing two women he does not know about the stoicism of marriage and virtue of being young parents?

She was in between jobs and struggling to make ends meet, so we offered to let her stay with us rent-free until she got back on her feet. We even offered to help her out by buying groceries for the three of us. However, she has been refusing to contribute any money towards groceries and has been taking advantage of our generosity.

At first, we didn't mind too much because we wanted to help her out. But now it's been several months and she still hasn't found a job, and we're starting to feel like we're being taken advantage of. We've had to dip into our savings to cover the cost of groceries for the three of us, and it's starting to put a strain on our finances.

We've tried talking to her about it, but she just brushes it off and says she'll pay us back when she gets a job. But we don't know how long that will be, and we can't keep supporting her financially indefinitely. We're starting to feel resentful and we don't know what to do.

To make matters worse, she has the audacity to go out and spend money on non-essential items like clothes and makeup, while we're struggling to pay for our basic necessities. It's not fair and we're starting to feel like we're being taken for granted.

We've also talked to our parents about the situation, but they just tell us to be patient and support our sister during this difficult time. But we don't know how much longer we can keep this up.

We're at our wit's end and we don't know how to approach the situation without causing a huge fight. What do you guys think? AITA for wanting her to pay us back for the groceries?

I thought she was really cool, so I tried really hard to build a friendship with her. Now, we're friends, but it seems like she doesn't really treat me as a real friend. She's so hard to communicate with as in she's a terrible texter and rarely picks up phone calls. But everything she calls or texts, I have to respond or I'm the rude one. About 8/10 times, she cancels on me last minute even though she would be the one who proposed the idea to hangout. 

For example, she recently called me to ask if I wanted to go to the beach. I said yeah of course because it would be nice to hangout with someone I consider a good friend. I asked again today to make sure that we're still going, and she said, ""oh I don't know if I'm going with you anymore because I asked C (another of her friends) if he wanted to go before you. He said no before so that's why I asked you but now he's saying he can go.""

I'm not going to lie, this pissed me off so bad. Because I've been getting stuff ready and saving money so I can go with her. This plus all the times she canceled on me is really starting to make me wanna drop her. 

Not only does she cancel on me, she's also super sensitive to the point where I'm walking around eggshells. We were at a bar and then I called someone over who was walking by because we're all friends. What I didn't know was that B and that friend got into a fight because she never told me anything. So she got super mad at me and kept snapping at me all night. 

Just today, I saw that this guy with the same name as this person that keeps trying to stalk and mess with her swipe right on me. I never saw him before and only heard his name. So I texted her asking if that's him. She said ""yeah"". I said ok then I won't talk to him. B said ""it looks like you already swiped right on him..."". In my mind, I was like how the fuck do you think that since I still have the heart option available to me to swipe right on him which clearly indicates i never fucking swiped right on him. I don't know why she's so mad when I never even said a word to him. I CAN'T CONTROL THAT HE SWIPED RIGHT ON ME.

I took a nap after all that because it seemed like everything was OK. I woke up to her text saying, ""if i find out you have talked to him knowing the situation or even knowing i have talked to him in the past i am going to block you and you will not be friends with me or anyone i introduced you to. there won't be any arguments you just will simply never hear me again. are we understood?"" 

At this point, I'm about to just drop her because I just making sure that's her stalker so I can avoid him but then she gets pissed at me plus she's cancels on me last minute and day of. 

I don't know maybe it's me. AITA?

For those of you who don't know it would take maybe a half hour. It's been maybe about 2 months and I kept asking if they'd read it yet, I mainly would ask on their days off when they're not doing anything as to not bother them too much about it.

I was a little sad everytime they said ""no"" but I never got genuinely upset until now.

We were talking about video games and I was talking about Fallout 4 and they said I should play New Vegas and that it is the best. I never planned on playing it but I told them I would if they read my book. I was nice about it and was just kinda being playful, I was going to either way because i figured it would have meant alot to them/made them happy. if they'd just kinda blown it off and said ""fine"" or ""whatever"" and rolled their eyes at me I would not have gotten upset, but no. They raised one hand up high and said something along the lines of ""this is how important New Vegas is"" and put the other hand down low and said ""this is how important your book is"". 

I was pretty shocked that they had said that considering playing an entire video game would take much longer than a short book, and the fact that I said I'd do it and they still felt the need to point out that what I asked was not important. They said it just ""Wasn't their thing"". I told them they might as well just give my book back to me and they said they would, the next day. They also said they'd ""make it up to me"" and I told them that they wouldn't be able to.

I blew it off for the rest of the day and tried to not be upset about it because I figured I was just overthinking it, but I literally cried later that day because I felt like they were indirectly saying that I was not important enough to them to do a small task.

I gave it a good 24hrs to think about why it had upset me so much, I was cold to them if they tried to talk to me, I told them I was not upset at them despite that not being true and actually snapped at them at one point. Then I messaged them about it.

""It really sucks that I asked you to do one thing that would have meant alot to me and you basically told me you won't and that it's not important.""
""So yeah, I was upset at you but didn't know to explain why so I didn't bother""
""At this point you'd only do it because you felt obligated, so don't bother, I'll get over myself""

They read it almost immediately  and then left me on read the entire day/never responded and now I feel like I over reacted and that they probably won't talk to me anymore.

2 years ago I got a long haired cat and decided to get him shaved during the summer because he has a really thick coat and seemed to overheat.
Since I have not had any experience with grooming salons I spent a few weeks looking into potential places and asking around before finding one I thought would be okay.
The appointment was at 2pm and I arrived 10 minutes early to fill out paper work and make sure everything was okay, I asked about approximate time it would take and they said a couple of hours which was perfect and let them know I would be waiting in my car, they said okay and took my cat to the back. I decided to stay since the drive was kinda far and was anxious about leaving my cat because he had never been away from home
After 2 hours I walk in and ask how everything was going and was assured by the worker at the front desk that everything was great and would only be another hour. I thanked her and went back out to my car. An hour later a different worker comes out to my car and says they are ready for my cat which startled me, I let her know that I gave them my cat 3 hours ago and asked where he was. The worker seemed startled by this news and rushed back inside, I didn’t hear anything else from them. Since hearing that news I went in every hour to ask about my cat where I was given the same generic answer and the worker seemed annoyed. I do feel bad for bothering her but hearing that they didn’t have my cat really put me on edge. 3 hours later (around 7-8) I get a call saying they are done, I rush inside get my cat and tip (35%) and leave.

She was apart of the class of 2020 so she never really got a graduation or prom, he first year of college was spent in her dorm, she was diagnosed with ADHD and depression, she put on at least 100 pounds, dropped out of college, moved back in with us, got a pretty decent job, and has now officially moved out. I know that overall she has been doing better, much happier, more active, etc. But she wanted to get a dog forever. She’s busy between work and her hobbies and doesn’t feel like she could take care of a dog.

So now she wants to either get a pair of mice or a pair of rats. She told me that with rats, she gets the benefits of a dog without the difficulties that come with a dog (most rats only live 2-3 years, she can teach it tricks, they can be affectionate,etc). I think they’re disgusting. They belong outside, they’re stinky, and just ick. She told me that it’s a lot easier spending an hour a day tending to the rats cleaning, feeding, and making sure they have enough water than to get a dog. She’d still be able to play with them and give them love and attention. She would have something to love and care for that is all her own. She thinks it would improve her mental health. I told her if she gets them she can forget about me coming over there or her younger brothers for that matter, absolutely no pet sitting coming from my household. I told her don’t even go as far as to send photos to them or talk about them with any of us.

She got really upset and was all like “would you at least support me? Would you still be proud of me?” When I told her no, not for that decision she got upset. Now it’s been a few days and she’s not answering my calls.

I also don’t really talk to a lot of people except for my girlfriend ofc (19 yo Female) and basically she went out to hang with friends 👍🏾 ok cool i mean I don’t mind then come to find out it’s a guy there… I didn’t know that and honestly I didn’t like it, she got me a lil sum sum but this is on me, I chose a bad time and I spoke on it and through a lot of back and forth and etc I overheard him saying are you off the phone” and I ofc got angry because she didn’t realize I was still otp and she said oh shit” and hung up, naturally me being petty I was like well I hope it was worth it etc etc and basically she called me back, and I felt kinda berated a bit and I mean am I wrong for feeling some type of way about that? She even went out of her way to say “I’ll have sex with him if you want me too” “ if you don’t stop annoying me I will” and obviously I don’t 🤨 I felt like she took it too far and she emasculated me, she laughed while I spoke to her in pain and that simmered all day long, flash forward to Sunday(today) at this point we had very little contact and honestly I assumed she cheated on me as per the last conversation, every-time I attempted to say something she would say she was high and she needs time but I know she’s talked to her family and so naturally I won’t why can’t she talk to me then?? That’s pretty odd. So basically I go and make a fake number and text her like hey, are u single?? We talk and she say yeah I am,, (note that’s the last message I see before I close the app in anger) she calls me and says we’re done and I’m like ? Because it turns out one of her friends who we will call Anton I basically used his name and said he gave me the number and apparently she called him and cussed him out and his family overheard and now their mad at her… and now she’s angry at me for doing too much and etc. Now I realize this was a mistake but part of me thinks hey, well she’s logged into all my information, but I don’t have that access and after multiple attempts to talk early on I felt neglected and I admit I messed up by faking that but what she said to me was unacceptable and she says she doesn’t remember saying it but part of me thinks she knew

In the meantime, I've had to pick up extra shifts at the laundromat, where I work, to make up for the lost income. 

My cousin (26M), also named Alex, stayed at our house last week, while he was recovering from a hair implant surgery. For the first time in 4 months, someone was there at home during the day with my wife. My cousin, Alex, came to me on Friday and asked me if I knew that my wife is bringing other people over during the day. I asked him to elaborate, and he said that, during the day, he was resting on the couch in our family room, and my wife presumably thought he was sleeping. Someone rung the doorbell, and my wife opened it, and brought her doula (31M), Brian, into the house. 

Alex said that my wife sat on a chair in the family room, and Brian started massaging her shoulders. He says that my wife and Brain talked about her pregnancy, and then headed to another part of the house. My cousin says he didn't want to do anything until I got there in case my wife decided to kick him out. 

I thought about it, then confronted my wife, on my day off, today, and asked her if this was true. She got really mad and said that it's been so hard for her to go through her pregnancy by herself and that Brain is only a doula and nothing else. She also accused my cousin of being lazy and ungrateful for her letting him stay in our house. I told her that I find her relationship with her doula to be inappropriate and that she should tell me if she's having company over, particularly if that company is male.

We're in an argument now, because I think that she should only meet with her doula if I'm there and that she lied to me by omission by not mentioning that people were coming over, and she thinks that it doesn't matter who comes over during the day and that she wasn't dishonest by not mentioning it to me.

Throwaway account because my friend is on here. 

For context, I (27f) have 4 girlfriends - Jay (25), Dee (30), Ann (30) and Tay (26).

We always go on trips/vacations etc. Last weekend, we invited Dee's fiance, Sean (33) to get more acquainted with the group. 

Sean cheated on Dee multiple times in the past so noone likes Sean but we didn't say anything as we didn't want to upset her during that time. 

Halfway along the trip, Tay pulled me and Ann over to let us know Sean was 'checking' me out. I didn't want anyone to think I 'liked' the attention or that I was encouraging it so i went along with Tay's advice to split away from the group on occasions. Due to this, I didn't bathe in the ocean because I was afraid they would think I encouraged Sean by wearing my bikini. Again, this was Tay's idea. 

The thing was Sean wasn't showing Dee attention. Instead, if there was a cliff or smth, he'd come by me to help. I couldn't exactly say no or it'd seem weird at those moments but I avoided him every other time. Tay and Ann also noticed this. 

The worst part was where he was helping me down a steep cliff. I actually appreciated the help cause it was wet with rainwater. But I slipped and he sort of caught me. And I made a noise. I swear it just came out. That sounded very much like a surprised moan/squeal if that's even a thing. I could see that he was affected cause his arm went around my waist and squeezed. And I mean we were...very close. And Dee also saw that. 

She didn't say anything. Due to that, I stayed by Tay and Ann's side for the rest of the trip until we had to split up for the hike. 

I was in the middle with Jay cause I'm used to hiking whilst most of the group was lagging behind. Then Sean hiked up to us when we reached a fallen tree. Jay crossed and resumed hiking. Then I crossed - and Sean made a very weird/sexual comment that I looked sexy with my legs open. 

I told him to knock it off and it's inappropriate. He did for the remainder of the hike until we reached a rest house. We were one of the few there and he blocked me by one of the windows. Rest houses are small. He said he knew I could 'feel' the attraction to each other. Proceeded to touch my arm. I shoved him off and left. Nothing else happened at the end of the trip. I haven't told Tay and Ann what happened.

But Dee asked if I was trying to seduce Sean. Ofc I felt offended cause they're my friends. Friends don't do that to each other. But I'm scared this doesn't look good for me and I'm thinking of taking this secret to the grave. I can avoid him in the future. I know what I'm up against now.

He was a little touchy (not sexual) and sometimes acting weird, like he wanted me to eat with him and forced me (physically, but not in a hurtful way) to join him at the table. But, I wasn't scared and I don't think he wanted me to feel awkward.

At the end of the day, I told what happended to my colleague who was about to take over my shift and he was very pissed. I told him that I will talk to our supervisor about it face to face this week.

But, he went behind my back and wrote to our supervisor about it, even after I told him that I'll do it.

His reasoning? He didn't think that I would talk. I told him that I had no problem telling him, why would I have a problem telling our supervisor. 

I understand he wants the best for me, but it's the fact he went behind my back. He didn't text me or call me.

I just wanted to talk and make sure it wouldn't happen again, that's it. Now, he doesn't even get paid. 

Oh and they need my report quickly since they started the investigation before having the complaint!

I am not upset to know he supports me, I'm upset about how he did it. I agree that the new guy needs to learn that that behaviour is not acceptable, I am not stupid. And I think it makes me kind of sad that my colleague thinks I'm just some kind of a weak woman who can't defend herself.

My best friend (27F) of 20yrs living in my home country recently started med school. We were chatting in March &amp; she made a comment about how everyone at festivals is always on drugs. I stated that wasn’t the case here, drugs are there obviously but most people just drink or smoke weed. She snapped back that weed is a drug. I agreed that by definition it is as is alcohol, but here it’s not included in what people would consider “hard drugs” given it has less restrictions on it than alcohol does. She said I sounded like one of her “druggie friends” &amp; we got into a whole argument where I was saying how cannabis has many uses beyond recreation &amp; she was going on about how wrong I was &amp; insinuating that I’m a druggie etc. Eventually I stopped replying as she was dismissing everything even when I linked peer-reviewed studies &amp; calling me a layman. We’d had conversations before about how I use weed because of the stress of my job + insomnia, so to me it felt I was being shamed for doing something my doctor recommended (over taking addictive pharmaceuticals). 

We stopped speaking. When my birthday came around in May she didn’t say anything. In June I travelled to my hometown for a month for the first time since covid. Given we hadn’t spoke in months &amp; she ignored my birthday I didn’t reach out to her. However, we still shared our locations with eachother &amp; I was posting pics to social media etc so not hard to figure out I was there. 

I leave &amp; when her birthday comes around in August I decided I’d be the bigger person &amp; wished her a happy birthday. She replies as if nothing ever happened, so I assume we’re just ignoring everything &amp; moving on so I go with it. 

Later I mention something I did when I was home &amp; she immediately gets pissed that I didn’t hang w her in June. I explain I didn’t think she wanted to see me given our argument &amp; that she ignored my birthday &amp; also it wasn’t a secret that I was in town as she has my location &amp; it was on my socials. She stated that she forgot my birthday as she was consumed by her studies, wasn’t using socials at the time &amp; rarely checks locations &amp; “It’s these sort of classic things where you need to ask otherwise it’s all in your head” &amp; then goes on about how the weed argument was a silly and wasn’t a big deal &amp; she would’ve asked for my side if the roles were reversed &amp; how her mental health is bad &amp; she’s “in no way insulted if you didn’t sign up for this &amp; want a break from me. I don’t have much to give right now.” 

I’m conflicted, it’s been a shit year for me too &amp; that really added to it so I kind of want to reply &amp; say that I think it’s BS that it was all in my head given we hadn’t gone that long without speaking ever &amp; that it wasn’t a “silly little argument” for me &amp; she’s old enough to take responsibility for her shit so the mental health explains it but doesn’t excuse it &amp; I want a proper apology.

In one of the days I was there, me, V, sister, bil and the baby had gone to the mall, and me and V had gone to a shop while they went to another one and me and V started to talk about the community in general, because she’s quite aware of it, even if her parents don’t talk about it near her and whenever I mentioned something about it near her, my sister would shush me quickly.
I didn’t explain to her that I’m trans, but she started asking the differences in it and I explained it (including saying who trans people were) and she told me she liked a girl from her class. We didn’t talk much about it in the following days, I came back home and all was well until this morning, when my niece texted me saying she had told sis and bil about it and asking me to say that she asked about it and not tell them about the girl who she told me about. A few minutes later, my sister texted me asking for my bank info to send me some money of something I had bought them that they didn’t tell me I shouldn’t, but instead of calling me by my dead nickname, she called me my full deadname (another reminder: I already legally changed my name) and didn’t say anything else after I sent the info to her, just texting me the payment voucher a bit later, but even if she didn’t tell me anything about it, I know she’s pissed with me and I’m pretty sure it has to do with me talking about it with V.

About an hour later someone else (a mutual friend I guess?) commented to tell me I needed to shut up and that I’m an idiot, then proceeded to tag said friend in a comment and tell her about how there are so many people who want to give unsolicited advice etc. I asked her to stop and she continued, and about the time she posted her 6th comment I fully removed myself from the situation and messaged my friend to apologize for the drama - but not the information.

This happened a few days ago, I was working from 5 to 9 PM and was on my 15 minute break, went to the Panera because it was the only place still open. Ordered a large coffee and a bowl with extra chicken and feta. I don't go there very often and felt bad because I had just been let on my break and it was 7:40 when I ordered, and they closed at 8. I struggle with an eating disorder and i'm not exactly thin, so I was just going to skip eating that day, but my manager made sure I went and got food somewhere since he knows a bit about my ED struggles. Since it was 15 minutes, he made sure i ordered food and then went back to the store to relieve the second worker, and said since it was slow i could eat in the back room of the store.  


While I was waiting for my food and coffee, the two foodprep workers both acknowledged I was standing there and I apologized for placing an order so late after I heard them start complaining about getting an order when they close at 8. They then, very loudly, started talking about how I didn't look like i needed a large or extra and such, and how I was being a pain in the ass for ordering so close to closing. I was trying really hard to stay composed but it just made me feel sick.  


After I got my food, I went back to work and drank my drink but saved my food for later. they ended up giving me a small drink and instead of extra chicken and feta, they gave me none. I mentioned their comments to my manager and apparently the workers in Panera talk like this to a lot of customers.  


I've been struggling even worse with eating after this, I feel really self conscious about it and when I talked to my mum she got PISSED.

Days later, they came, the kids went up to play. My husb was upstairs, I invited her to sit so we could chat. It was nothing like when we met prior. I tried to crack jokes &amp; make small talk. She never laughed.

After an hr, she had asked me something &amp; interrupted my answer with ""Ugh, am I ever going to see your husband??""

Now that he was down, the convo flowed smoothly. I made lunch for the kids-while I was cleaning she asked if hers could spend the night. I agreed. First she told me to clear it with 'the man of the house'...
She then asked if I had soy milk and 'good snacks'. I said no, but if it was a dietary thing we could run to the store. We went, I purchased stuff for her kid that she approved of, &amp; a case of tea she mentioned she would like.

While I'm putting the groceries away, she told me her husband didn't approve of the sleepover. By this time it was getting close to dinner, I was unsure of how to tell her it was time to leave. My husb kept giving me looks, but neither of us brought it up. So..I made us all dinner.
Close to 8, they left. On her way out, she took all of the teas. A few hours later, she called my husb. He ignored it. She texts me, ""Can you meet me and bring me my milk &amp; snacks?""

Essentially I said ""that sucks. Maybe your kid can nap with you. byee""

A few days later, she asks me to babysit while her and her husb shop for bday presents. She specified that it would only be for 2 hrs.
Time comes, I call and ask where she's at. She tells me they haven't even left yet. I told her I can no longer babysit, &amp; I'm on the way. They weren't home.
She finally txted and said they had left to grab some lunch, they needed another hr.

I know it's worth a lot of money and I don't want to part with it, but I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do.

Here's the situation: I was engaged to my ex-fiancé for about a year before we broke up. When we got engaged, he gave me a beautiful engagement ring that was worth about three months of his salary. It was a big investment for both of us, but we were happy and excited at the time.

Now that we've broken up, I'm not sure if I should keep the ring. On the one hand, it was given to me by my ex-fiancé and it's rightfully mine. On the other hand, I'm not sure if it's right to keep something that was given to me as part of a failed relationship. My friends are split on the decision but my ex-fiancé has been harassing me for the past two months asking for the ring back, but I'm not sure if I want to give it to him.

While actively doing that I have ran into the few “freedom of speech” jerks. That’s whatever to me now, but I do sympathize with the people who are hurt &amp; affected by ignorant comments like that.

Anyways, I had posted a vid on my campaigns tiktok page about how some people are just addicted to hate and will attack those who try to stand up against it &amp; attempt to make the peacemaker look like a joke. I also mentioned how there is a time &amp; place for the extremely unfunny “skill issue” “”joke””
With that being said the entire comment section was full of nasty nasty comments. However, this one young teen girl had commented thanking me for making the video bc she had just lost her father and her classmates were calling it a skill issue (which makes no sense.) 

Anyways, some random kid with profile picture of neurodivergent baby responded to the girls comment saying “that’s a coping issue, get over it.” I respectfully responded to his comment, saying to please have respect for someone who is grieving and how there is a time and place for certain jokes. A few minutes later I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. This kid made a video response to the comment I left in attempt to stand up for the girl. In the video was two boys in front of a casket with a wreath that said “rest in peace, dad”on it, but the words were crossed out with skill issue photoshopped over it. The comments surprisingly were filled with people asking him what in the actual hell was wrong with him. I commented on the video and told him to please leave the girl alone. He responded to me saying “chill it’s fine. I’m the kid in the picture.” I responded saying “I am so so so sorry for your loss but your pain and grieving is not an excuse to harass other people, especially those who are dealing with the same thing that you are. Not OK on any level. I understand everyone grieves differently but maybe I can help you come up with a better way to process your pain rather then projecting it onto people.” He then just blocked me.

I have a twin sister and 2 older brothers.  The eldest (I'll call him Frank) is 10 years older than me and my sister and these events took place between my 7/8 and 14 years old. Frank always had strange attitudes and dubious behavior with me and my sister.  For example, when we were little he used to ask us to give him massages because he was very tired and then he would say that he had to give us massages too to thank us.  He used to come into the bathroom when my sister or I were taking a shower and sometimes he tried to help and then he always said not to talk to anyone.  This mostly happened when my parents weren't home.  My father passed away when I was 10 and from then  things started to get worse.  Frank started sneaking into our room during the night,touching me or my sister inappropriately.  Sometimes he asked if I was enjoying it and although I always said no, he continued.  He only stopped when he went to work abroad.  For many years I kept these memories hidden.  It may seem unbelievable but when he came to visit we acted like a normal family (I now know that this is normal defensive behavior for a victim).  Time passed, I moved out of my mother's house and then out of town. I started going to the therapist and I started to feel more and more resentful towards my brother.  More and more disgusted.  And I cut off all contact with him.  I finally told him everything I felt and that I wanted to no longer be part of his life nor he of mine and that if he tried to get close to me again I would tell the rest of the family everything he did.  
Whenever there were family gatherings and he was there, I didn't go.  It was getting harder and harder to justify why I avoided Frank completely so I ended up venting to my other brother.  He was shocked, he cried and apologized to me for never realizing it and for not protecting us.  His look told me that if he had the chance, he would kill him... I asked him to keep it a secret and that I only told him so that he would understand why there was no longer a relationship between me and Frank.  Well he also cut all contact with Frank and he broke down and went to talk to my sister.  Now my sister is angry with me for telling ""our secret"" and she feels ashamed.  And she told me I'm an AH for not talking to frank and causing our brother to stop talking to him too, as that would raise questions from the rest of the family.  She says this all happened a long time ago and I should move on and not hold grudges over past mistakes.  This especially hurts me as she knows what I went through as she went through the same thing.

Own hair done as well. After 3 hours and six stylists we were able to get the matting out and recommended home care to the child. At first the mother said no to those products but purchased for herself (eventually ended up purchasing home care) 

Now April comes and this little girl is back AGAIN for a dematting. Again three hours and five to six stylists working intervals. 

Today…. The girls mother drops her off and stating her father will be here to pick her up in two hours.
The girls head is matted from scalp to ends. She is in tears as we work. The father suggests cutting it however it’s so matted to the root we would have to shave her head. She came in at 930 am and we had to relieve her at 430 pm and is scheduled to come in tomorrow to finish it up.

This last summer my mother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My parents thought I might be developing it as well, but we were just focusing on my mother. When my grandparents heard about it, they rented an apartment right next to us and moved out. When we heard the news we were excited for a little extra help, but not too thrilled it was them. In the past they've been known for hiding/making mom's mental health worse. My grandfather is also a very controlling person, but we went with it. The week my grandparents moved in I started school again. I'm in all honors classes, the school musical, the soccer team and student government. In the beginning we were actually glad they were here. My grandma helped around the house, but she made a lot of hurtful comments about my clothing. Meanwhile my grandpa helped give us rides. It was fun seeing them, but it went downhill quickly. They tell all of our friends details about things at home, giving us no privacy. 

I had soccer practice before school every morning. My grandpa took me. It was great for a little while, but then he would repeatedly say bad things about my mom. Calling her insane and delusional. I did not like his words, but I just dealt with it. Outside of school our grandparents would show up. They wouldn't ask. Grandpa went into my room and made creepy comments about how messy it was. 

One day after I explained a big issue at school to him in the car, he told me my concerns don’t matter and all I should be thinking about is my mom. The next week after a bad day he lectured me again. I was mad so I yelled at him. He then explained that everything he said was from a 'medical perspective' and he 'didn't mean to hurt me with medical terms I didn't understand'. I went home. I told my mom about all the things my grandfather had said to me (it had been almost 3 months at this point). I said I didn't want him to take me to soccer anymore. My mother understood and we worked out a way for Dad to take me. I learned later that Grandpa was also saying the same things to my dad and 13 year old brother. 

At the end of the week my mom made me apologize for what I said in the car. She said it was more hurtful than it should have been. I said I would apologize to him after he apologized to me, but that never happened and I was still forced to send an apology note. I rode with him for the final week of soccer. Then they ruined our thanksgiving by canceling our plans. So I texted both of my grandparents. I sent a long mean note. Now things have calmed down, but I've refused to talk to them or let grandpa drive me anywhere. My family thinks I'm being harsh. I don't want to see them, but now that my whole family is against me I've got to know.

I was accepted into a prestigious internship program and paired with a mentor who works for Vogue Magazine. Being an editor for a magazine has been my life-long dream. When we started speaking, I noticed she only ever had negative things to say about Vogue. She hated her colleagues, her boss, the stories she was writing, the pay, the events she went to, and so on. She rarely, if ever spoke positively about her work. When her contract with Vogue ended, I applauded and congratulated her since it seemed like she really disliked that job. I realized very quickly that that was a grave mistake. I could tell she felt extremely disrespected. She told me she enjoyed her time there and will continue to work with them on and off in the future. I had an internship in London (which she encouraged me to apply to in order to meet her), but she ignored me the entire time I was there. I was absolutely devastated. My last week in London, she told me she had been too busy partying with her friends in Ibiza to grab coffee with me. I can’t help but feel like it’s because I insulted her job.

I began inviting her to my biweekly parties with my other friends as i believed they would mesh really well.

When Alex moved she joined tinder to find hookups in our city and met “Bob” (18+M) (idk his age). Alex was really interested in him and would talk to me and our mutual friends during course. To be honest i didn’t like him, because of things he said to her while at past partys, such as me and my friends “manipulating” her into drinking even though she’s above legal age here in NZ and she can make her own decisions.

Now two weeks ago we had our biweekly party and Alex invited Bob without asking me or my flatmates (19 and 22M). I found out because i had also invited another friend and she told me when she had arrived. I then messaged Alex asking if it were true and she had said yes it was, and if it was ok. I said not really, She then stopped replying and showed up with him anyways.
Flatmates and I weren’t happy about this because we only invite close friends since we are all LGBT+ and Neurodiverse, and only like getting drunk around people we feel comfortable with. Throughout the night, he made really racy jokes about flirting with minors and about the LGBT community that no one really liked. He also would repeatedly touch/slap her ass around us, which made it extremely uncomfortable. 

By the end of the night, I told Alex that he made us really uncomfortable (all of us had been talking to each other privately about it) and that he isn’t allowed back, but she is free to come again. I said it was nothing against her, but we were setting boundaries for the future. (Admittedly, Both me and Alex were drunk during this convo, so maybe my tone could’ve been off but i don’t exactly remember) she had agreed and she respected the boundaries we set. 

Two weeks have passed and throughout those two weeks, she has been very icy towards our small study group, even yelling at them (i wasn’t there for that but heard about it the day after).
Today i went up to Alex after our midterms and asked if we could talk  as she was warming up to the others but was still completely icy towards me. She snapped at me by saying “i don’t really want to” in a tone that count only be read as angry.

This has made me super upset as i have past trauma and diagnosed ptsd around people, especially friends getting mad and ignoring me and eventually dropping me. Her snapping at me triggered my anxiety and i had an anxiety attack on the bus home. I don’t wanna lose her as a friend over this, but i’m not sure if i did anything wrong because she won’t talk to me and hasn’t talked to me these past two weeks

AITA?

My wife and I have an infant son. We made an agreement that since she is a SAHM she will do the night feeds when I have to work the next morning and I will take him on my days off so she can rest. It’s not entirely fair, I know, and he is a good baby for the most part but he has his nights where he is a lot to handle. My wife is a wonderful mother and takes such good care of him almost to her detriment sometimes. Things that a lot of mothers would let go of so they can rest- she doesn’t. That boy is probably one of the best taken care of babies in the world. 

Today when I got home my wife was visibly tired and mentioned as much. So I offered to take him for his night feed (he is down to one now) so she can sleep mostly uninterrupted even though I have work. After spending an hour and change with him directly after work while my wife showered and did dinner I left to the front porch to sit for about 15 minutes and have a cigarette. For context I am an air traffic controller and I need to be on my shit when I show up to work. It can be stressful and sometimes I need a few minutes to decompress from the day and this is known to my wife. 

I was on the porch for about 10 minutes and my wife opens the door and shakes her head at me. I come back inside and ask if everything is ok. She says “I thought you were taking him tonight.” I say “I am I was only on the porch for about 15 minutes I said I’d do his feed.” She responds “One feed?” with this incredulous look on her face. “I guess I misunderstood what you meant.” I said “It’s ok I just wanted a minute I’ll take him for the rest of the night.” She refused and she has since been very passive aggressive.
