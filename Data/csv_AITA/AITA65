It is my first full time job (9am-5pm), and I don't have much money yet. 

So here's the story: in my team, we have 2 remote days per week. But because of my situation (2 hours from work, no car yet), I asked my manager if I could take one or two more remote days here and then until I get an apartment closer to the site. He answered that it would be unfair for the others to officialy allow this, but I still could stay at home some days since it is a temporary situation, and it doesn't affect my work.

So now I am looking for an apartment, but I am a bit short on money and still in trial period, and that blocks me for at least 1 or 2 months from moving there.

However, my manager puts more and more pressure on me for being absent on some non remote days, asking for proofs that I actually can't, by any way, come to site. I said that I technically could come, but it's not worth it to degrade my mental health by doing 4 hours rides 3 days a week to do the exact same thing I can do at home. Then he threatens me that I will maybe not pass the trial period because of this.

As I said, I have not much money, so I can't afford taking a new apartment then instantly lose my job, making me stressfull for taking the decision to try to keep this job, or if I should just find another one right now.

Other than that, the job and my coworkers are great, if there was not this problem I would stay without any hesitation.

So here's my question: AITA for taking more remote days than I should, or am I right to consider this pressure abusive considering I am actively trying to move closer ?

Yesterday, I went to work – I commute about an hour and a half a day, my partner works from home – to find we were very short staffed so it was a really hectic shift. When I arrived home my (partners) nephew was at ours - we have him once a week - and last night we had organised to take him to a shopping centre for Xmas.

I did some laundry, made dinner, loaded the dishwasher and then drove us all to the shopping centre. We spent most of the evening looking for gifts for our nephew.

Around 9:15pm, we left and I drove us to my sister in laws house (about 30 minutes away). We went in, said hi and had a little catch up. It was getting later so I let my partner know I was tired and asked if we could head home soon. He said sure and carried on chatting a bit longer which was fine. I asked again a few minutes later and we left. I drove us home (another 20 minutes) and we got home just after 11pm. I work from 8:30am so I'm up earlier than my partner and wanted to get to bed.

We ended up having a row because he said I shouldn't have asked to leave early as he only wanted another 5 minutes with his family and he felt hurried. He explained that when he is with my family – regardless of how he feels – he waits until I want to leave and doesn't say anything. I'd never noticed this to be honest as he hadn't explained this was a rule and so I just assumed we were leaving at a time that he was also happy with.

So frankly, I hit the roof in a way which wasn't constructive. I have apologised for this already and will again later. My partner kept laughing at me being angry and that made it worse. 

I'd been working hard all day, driven to and from work (unlike my partner), done house work, driven him and his nephew around and at the end of it all I'm supposed to just sit and wait until I'm 'allowed' to go home. I just felt totally taken for granted and like he didn't care about how my day had been.

I kept bringing up all the nice things I do for his family. I'm renting his mum a property and asking for way less than the market rate so she can afford it – but he told me that wasn't relevant and I shouldn't bring it up. I do so many nice things for his family – when they come over I will cook for 8-10 people at a time and cover all the costs, and buy birthday and Xmas gifts and cards (he often forgets).

To be fair to my partner, he is wonderful with my family. My parents are separated so we have to spend time with both parties and he does this as often as he can. He has good relationships with all of them and although he doesn't buy gifts or cards, he helps out lots of with house jobs and stuff.

I just feel so hurt and confused and taken for granted. I tried to explain, yes I wanted to leave a little earlier than my partner did, but I had work and wanted to sleep.

Hi , Me 34 (M) and my wife (35F) have 3 children. 1 girl and two boys. 

 Our eldest ""Jordan"" ( 10f) was born in January. My brother's ( 30M) wife gave birth to a boy in November the same year and named him Jordan. At that point, we didn't care too much because ours was a girl and theirs was a boy.

Then, we had baby n°2 ""Sam"" (7M) , he was born in July then in June the next year my brother had his 2nd son and named him ""Sam"".  My wife was super pissed off, and struggled to accept it. But my family found it so cute, that I just went with it.

Last year in December we welcomed our third baby and son ""Levi"". Yes, you guessed it. My sister-in-law gave birth to a baby boy 2 weeks ago and named him Levi.

My wife refuses to visit my family now. I asked my parents, don't you find it fucking weird??? They said no. It's cute. My find finds it creepy and so do I.

I travelled alone to see the baby, and once him and I were alone I lost my shit. I told him something like this : 

"" You and your fucking wife need to find a personality and stop copying us. You are a sick bastard , what do you want from me?""

Then he went on to say "" Well there's nothing you can do"".

I insulted him. Now I keep receiving texts from my parents telling me how horrible I am, how I should we should be flattered.  This whole situation makes me feel so uneasy. My nephews are named like my kids !!!

Just to get this out the way, I' f32, am childfree to the core. I have no issues with kids I'm just not fund of the idea of having kids of my own. Mil thinks it's just a ""phase"" and that I'll regret not having kids especially at that age 🙄, but I have made it perfectly clear that I don't want kids.



She kept pestering me about it like mentioning how her sister, niece, neighbor's daughter are blessed with having kids. And also buying me random baby stuff on ocassions.


Now it's gotten worse because now she started using her new diagnosis to apply more pressure on me to have her grandbaby.


She started sending me baby pics every morning....like literally every single morning. Don't get it twisted, a pic of a gigling baby is cute but, I have literally *ZERO* maternal instinct when it comes to human babies, ZERO. I tried to ignore it, even asked her to stop but she kept on sending those baby pics daily. I got tired of it and decided to spam her with random pics as a response. I'd send back random stuff like a pic of a walrus, pluto, harry potter, pumpkin, buzz lightyear...just random stuff I find on the internet that literally makes no sense. Obviosuly, she got pissed off and started an argument about it saying I was being snarky and insensitive with how I responded to something she deems ""important"". My husband got involved and scolded me for it saying it was childish to basically spam his mom like that. I told him about those baby pics she kept sending but he said I could've just dealt with it more civily.

Now Luci was a large male cat with history of being aggressive with vets. In February 2022 I tried to get Luci to have an ECG, but as he was being aggressive against the vets they said they couldn’t do it. Furthermore, they mentioned the heart murmur was still in the early stage (I think stage one) and so there was no rush for scans happen. After this consultation, my mother said we shouldn’t take Luci to the vets for any scans, as he is fine and there is no point causing stress.

In September I took Luci for a routine consultation, and the vets heard a stage three murmur, as this murmur got worse quickly I instantly booked an ECG again the next week. This time they heard a stage four murmur, and the same issue happened with Luci being aggressive and no ECG done. Luci was then referred to a major vet hospital. 

I was worried about going there, as it took longer to get to than the usual vets. But I figured it’d be for one day, and we would be able to find out what was going on with his heart, and potentially get ahead with meds to offset any heart disease issues caused.

This hospital is roughly 45 minutes away, and Luci hates being in a carrier. I took Luci yesterday (28/11) to this hospital, after having to keep him fasted since midnight. The appointment was at 13:30. Luci made horrible noises, growling and meowing, I didn’t take note of this as he does usually do this when in his carrier.

The cardiologist took a look at my cat and like the other vets, declined to do the ECG as he was being aggressive. He instead said I could try sedating him myself with some tablets he prescribed (Gabapentin) for the next time. Now, the consultant had my cat with him for roughly 50 minutes and said he did not give Luci any sort of medication or drug.

After I took Luci to the car, I gave him some food as he hadn’t eaten for roughly 14/15 hours, he ate what little he could in discomfort as he was in his carrier and refused to leave, even with the entrances open. On the journey home, Luci meowed a few times, and then five minutes from home he passed away suddenly. His death was so shocking as he was so young. I was in the middle of driving when my dad told me he hasn’t moved, and when I checked, Luci was dead. 

My mother was very close to Luci, and blamed me for his death, saying I shouldn’t have meddled in his health as much as I did, and he was perfectly healthy the way he was. My father also said the same. I can’t help but feel responsible for his death. Both my parents told me not to take him to the vets as there would be no point in starving him if he seemed okay. 

I am angry at my parents for saying this and haven’t spoken to them since. I get they loved Luci, but the last thing I wanted is for Luci to die. I can still see his corpse with his eyes open looking at me, and I can’t get that image out of my head.

This story concerns the oldest son, Chris (32M), and his partner Francesca (30F).

In our family, I host most of the family gatherings, because my house is big enough to accommodate everyone staying over. Now, I don't particularly enjoy hosting. The cost is astronomical, it takes a long time to plan, and it's quite stressful. However, I have no problem doing it, and I know that everyone enjoys it, and I certainly prefer being at home. There are upsides, but my point is, hosting is not something I jump at the chance to do.

This year, however, Francesca asked if they could host Christmas. Nobody was keen on this, as their house is very small, no one would be able to stay over so a good chunk of the day would be spent driving (so there would be no drinking for some), the kitchen is tiny so cooking for so many people wouldn't be simple, and they don't have a table large enough to accommodate us all. Despite all this, on the spot no one could think of a polite way to say no, so we all sort of went along with it.

A few days ago, Francesca sent round a group text asking if everyone would be alright bringing something to Christmas, a food dish of some sort, as their oven wasn't large enough to cook everything from scratch and if we all brought something to warm up, that would be easier. Later on in our family group chat (parents and siblings only) my other step-siblings said it would have been better if I hosted Christmas. Even George agreed and said Francesca was totally stressed out about the planning. At this point, my mum suggested maybe I should take it over, since that would take the stress off everyone and save them all a drive. Everyone jumped on the idea and practically begged me to do it. George said he'd talk to Francesca about it since everyone else was in agreement, and I said okay.

I heard nothing more about it until last night, when Francesca sent me a long message, and she was furious. She said I should have refused hosting when asked, because I knew how important it was to her (which I didn't). She accused me of ruining her chance to finally be part of the family, and of lobbying to host Christmas so that I could embarrass her, which is not true. I tried to explain to her that I was just trying to make everything easier for everyone, and that I didn't offer, I was asked, but it was a bit vague because I was trying not to throw everyone else under the bus. Eventually she just stopped replying. I really thought I was at least saving Francesca and everyone else a bit of stress, but a couple of my friends say I should have let her sink or swim on her own, since she was so adamant about hosting.

I had no problem in the start. In fact, I was happy that I could share my interests with my two sisters. 

But then, I started noticing that they started copying EVERYTHING: whatever I showed interest in, or whatever had become my passion or a sort of identity of WHO I am, they started doing it too.

Soon, it became annoying because I felt they were who I was. I started feeling like I didn’t have my own identity, if that makes sense. I couldnt have my OWN personal likes and passions that were solely just my one.

So I told them to not copy EVERY new hobby I started or my passion especially since we’re now no longer kids etc. and they were like “you have no right to stop us, if we like something you do, we can do it too.”

And I guess in a way that makes sense but I just wanted them to have certain boundaries when it came to copying what I like and I told them that.

I love her with all my heart, but there’s things I dont tell her because I’m scared she’d think of me differently… One of those things is things is that I’m bisexual. She had a really weird reaction when i said to her at one point that “I wasn’t into older men” And honestly, i decided it was best i held off i on telling her.

Now onto the point of this post.

I have an old coworker who I had(have?) a major crush on. He was tall, dark haired, perfect. I don’t know if he was into other guys at all. But that’s more information than what’s needed I think? The point is, me and said coworkers were joking around one day while accidentally bumping into each other at the gym. I don’t remember what was said but, as a joke he looked at me and was like “Hell yeah I’d eat your ass Gavin” And honestly, I’ll admit, I think about it a lot. Again, major crush. This was about 7 or 8 months ago in April or May I believe? 

Yesterday I texted my great friend about this guy and word for word I said “so Im at the gym, and literally all I can think about is how one time I was at the gym with John Doe, and coworker was there. One thing lead to another and somehow it ended up with coworker saying he’d eat my ass and thats all I can think about tonight 😂”

She texted back “oh yeah lmao” and I thought that was that. But a minute after she texted me “Well I think you should keep reminding yourself it was a joke” 

And honestly, Im pretty upset over it. I know its a joke. Its just also a fantasy. I don’t think its wrong to have fantasies even while you’re in a relationship? To me, it almost feels like it was implied I’d do something if the opportunity was ever given. When no, I’m in an very happy relationship. Plus i know how much cheating can hurt another person. I could never.

To make a long story short, I (f29) was married to my ex husband ""Cameron"" (m34) for a short time. I found out that he cheated on me with his (then) ex wife while I was pregnant and we got divorced. Our daughter is  3 y/o and he's pretty involved in her life, mostly financially. Tbh, there's been issues between me and his wife because she tends to get involved in the co-parenting that Cameron and I have. She's struggled with fertility issues for over 10 years and counting. I don't know if she's doing anything about it but it bothers me when she basically tries to parent my daughter on Cameron's behalf. I though I was being an overreactor but things gradually began to get worse. She'd get more clingy to my daughter.




My daughter spends the holidays with me and my family per usual. This is mostly because Cameron is usually so busy around the holidays (he works in the emergency department). This year's no different. However, I was contacted by him asking if I'd let him take our daughter to spend christmas at his house this year. I thought that he didn't have work but after he explained, it turned out that he'll be busy and won't be home for christmas but wanted our daughter to spend some christmas time with his wife. I was floored upon learning this. I asked if he was serious and he pointed out how I always have our daughter during the holidays and said it was time to make things even. I told him no, because for one he won't be home to spend christmas with her which is the point of letting him have her. And two, his wife isn't her mother and for him to expect me to let my daughter spend christmas with HER and away from ME her mother was ridiculous. He went on about how much his wife adores our daughter and how she's like a second mother to her, how she never got to make any memories with our daughter ""as a family"" for christmas and that it wasn't her fault he's never home on holidays. etc, etc, etc, I refused and said no.

I love her with all my heart, but there’s things I dont tell her because I’m scared she’d think of me differently… One of those things is things is that I’m bisexual. She had a really weird reaction when i said to her at one point that “I wasn’t into older men” And honestly, i decided it was best i held off i on telling her.

Now onto the point of this post.

I have an old coworker who I had(have?) a major crush on. He was tall, dark haired, perfect. I don’t know if he was into other guys at all. But that’s more information than what’s needed I think? The point is, me and said coworkers were joking around one day while accidentally bumping into each other at the gym. I don’t remember what was said but, as a joke he looked at me and was like “Hell yeah I’d eat your ass Gavin” And honestly, I’ll admit, I think about it a lot. Again, major crush. This was about 7 or 8 months ago in April or May I believe? 

Yesterday I texted my great friend about this guy and word for word I said “so Im at the gym, and literally all I can think about is how one time I was at the gym with John Doe, and coworker was there. One thing lead to another and somehow it ended up with coworker saying he’d eat my ass and thats all I can think about tonight 😂”

She texted back “oh yeah lmao” and I thought that was that. But a minute after she texted me “Well I think you should keep reminding yourself it was a joke” 

And honestly, Im pretty upset over it. I know its a joke. Its just also a fantasy. I don’t think its wrong to have fantasies even while you’re in a relationship? To me, it almost feels like it was implied I’d do something if the opportunity was ever given. When no, I’m in an very happy relationship. Plus i know how much cheating can hurt another person. I could never. 

This whole interaction has me pretty upset and stirred up on the inside.

When my dad entered into a relationship with her years ago, at the time I was struggling with severe depression and when he asked my bro and I to meet her, I didn't particularly want to; not because I had a problem with him finding happiness again after he and my mother divorced, but because I was in a wretched state and embarrassed about it, from bullying throughout my school years and also having recently got out of an extremely abusive relationship. Nevertheless, I agreed to because I was worried if I didn't, it would give the wrong impression.

It didn't go well. She treated me with scorn. Finally she told me to my face that ""you're the most pathetic person I've ever met."" Also, ""you're just trying to hurt your parents, aren't you."" In all honesty, I can't begin to overstate how wounded I was by those comments, and as a consequence I stopped being able to trust her, and my self-esteem plummeted further to almost pathological depths.

Long story short, we underwent an uneasy truce after her youngest son died a decade ago. My dad was on a golfing holiday at the time so she called me and asked me to come over, which of course I did because no one deserves that.

Recently, my dad was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I again went over to help out, as she was struggling and needed me to help him while she was at work, which I was happy to do. We wound up having a row as to how best to handle the situation, and she told me I was ""doing her head in"" by constantly talking about possible treatment scenarios. She had already asked me to stop and I admit I handled it badly because I was struggling too, so I reacted defensively and raised my voice; she firmly (and rightly) shut me down. I came home the next day, telling my dad I was sorry and it was no one's fault, it just hadn't worked out.

Yesterday I sent her a letter, apologising unreservedly for my behaviour and taking full responsibility, but followed that by politely asking for an apology from her for her previous dehumanising comments, all in the name of familial harmony, improving my own mental health and in the hope that I can spend what may be dad's last Xmas with him without possible conflict.

On thanksgiving we did the usual two houses, my house first DH house second. We have a 7 month old daughter. By the time we got to DH parents house we had already skipped a nap or two, but she was going strong. Anyways, MIL grabbed the baby and walked away into the kitchen. I notice my daughter was still crying a moment later and I get up to grab a drink and see if she’s good. She’s still crying, she’s over tired, it’s loud and there are a lot of people that I’ve never met. So I tell MIL “I’ll take her.” MIL says “you can let her cry” so I respond with “She doesn’t need to cry right now.” And I walk back into the living room with my now calm daughter and let DH know that I had just done that and I even mention it to my therapist the next day. 

Fast forward two days, DH is getting reamed out because MIL is saying my daughter wasn’t crying and that I said “I’m taking her before she starts crying” and all of a sudden DH’s 3 sisters are yelling at him about my behavior and claiming that they all witnessed me say that despite not actually being in the room. They go back and forth via text and DH tells me that everything is all my fault because I upset his mother and now I’ve created massive conflict in the family. I explain to him what had happened again and he insists that I should have at least stayed in the room and passed her back once she was soothed. Thing is, I took her back into the living room and put her on where she instantly fell asleep. Once she had woken up later I approached MIL multiple times giving her an opportunity to hold the baby and she did not even look at us. Anyways, his 3 sisters call later that night and I listen to them yell at him (again) about keeping the baby from the family and my inappropriate behavior because they feel like we don’t go to their house frequently enough despite MIL only visiting once in the past 3 months and SILs visiting on average once a month. The SIL who complains the most is the one who lives a 4 hour flight away. 

Last time MIL visited she was upset our daughter cried when she held her. She then took the dog home with her for the night (dog used to live with them). 

Anyways, because I literally cannot continue with this I sent them a lengthy text explaining that their relationship with my daughter is important and they can have their opinions, but they’re overstepping. They responded with they have concerns that they haven’t had alone time with my 7 month old and that I need to respect them as aunties.

He got so over pushing about that damn note and wouldn’t let it go! He continued to ask “is that about me?!”, “What’s on it”, “why is it locked”. Me: “no it’s just some joke shit, nobody specific just general ick’s”. Obviously I’m lying but I’m trying so hard for him to stop push and he does the opposite. He wouldn’t let the matter go! 

I ended up just showing him and it was bad. I know it was bad because some of the things I had written was about “narcissistic mother in law?”, “pushes me too hang out”, “shit at cooking”, “lazy and unproductive at times”, etc. you get the point… but I mean all of those things are true?! I wrote them down just to get a clearer view about if I wanted a future with this guy?

He read the note and I could see him getting more and more pissed off. He was ready to go off like a bomb… but he didn’t say a word…. He just got up. I was trying to say things to make him talk to me but he just continued to gather his bag. I tried to get in front of him and to explain myself. But he didn’t even look at me… he just walked out!

So I(F) have a group of friends that I regularly hangout with, most of us know eachother from college or are mutual friends or SOs. We mostly hang out indoors for movie night on weekend at someone's place who is avalibe to host. It's just a simple evening with snacks booze and movies and some random talks. 

So past weekend my friend 'Alex' hosted the movie night. Alex's sister decided to join us and we had no problem in that as she had joined us before. We were talking about movie to watch and she suddenly out of  owhere told me that there is no need to wear so much of makeup it's a night in. So I replied I am not wearing makeup. But she started calling me a liar and told me that last time when we met my sink was more darker, either I have too much keep on or have done cosmetic procedure to lighten my skin. And then wen on a Rant about how it's raisit of me to lighten my skin as many people suffer due to their skin being of darker colour.

After she had done talking I explained to her that I have translucent skin, so depending on the weather and on my energy levels my skin may look brighter or dull, I sometimes 9ut light makeup so redness of my face doesn't show when I am too hot or tired, but his wasn't one of those times. And told her I was not wearing makeup. She didn't belive me and told my bf, do you really want to stay with such a lying b*tch. This was uncalled for so I asked her to mind her own business and not poke her nose where it's not needed. 

She got silent went to her room and I thought that was it, but I guess she told her mom what happend and she came down and told me to not talk to her daughter like that in her house or I could leave. 

Alex was very apologetic and told me to ignore them, so we enjoyed the night. But now I feel I could have just ignored her and not put damper on our night.

It is tomorrow. We have established it is tomorrow, weeks ago. ((It’s a bit early but just the best opportunity)). 

One person tells us that they don’t have anything - he’s been busy apparently and haven’t been able to get it done. First thing that annoyed me - we’ve had weeks and like. Come on. ((I know for a fact that this person hasn’t been that busy - I also know for a fact this person goes to the shops just cause many many times a week)). 

And at least 2 other people have said that they didn’t spend money and they just made something instead. I am all for sentimental gifts, I’m a believer of gifts with meaning rather than for the price tag. But we set a budget right? $10-20. I spent $20, my best friend spent $10. At least 2 people spent 0. Again, I know it’s NOT because of financial struggles because of a variety of reasons that aren’t really relevant - but mainly, they spend a bunch of money on themselves and things they do.

Today, the dog is 15 and we have 2 kids, both below the age of 10.

Previously, we did go on overseas holidays here and there, and we would send our dog to a home-based boarder. For some context, our dog is considered dog aggressive. The boarder is a friend of ours and has dogs of her own. As our dog knew these dogs when he was a puppy, he gets along well with them. I've never used any other boarding service as this option works out very well for us.

These days, my dog's cognitive function has weakened and he has the onset of dementia. The boarder is also no longer available as she has moved overseas after her dogs have passed away.

My wife and kids were looking forward to a Christmas vacation overseas and I decided that was not feasible given my dog's current condition. He wakes up in the middle of the night in a lost state of mind and needs alot of soothing. I'm not keen on finding a boarding facility for him as I feel a new environment would be too stressful.

I understand that my family was looking forward to the holidays and I decided that the best compromise would be to either ask them to go ahead themselves or to also offer to pay for my in-laws to go with them.

My wife was unhappy at my decision and sees it as me prioritizing our dog over the family. I don't see it as choosing one over the other but my dog is at the tail-end of his life and I feel responsible for ensuring he's as comfortable as possible. There are no plans to put him down yet as his physical condition is still alright. He just has these lapses in his state of mind at night. I've also told my wife I don't see myself going overseas until he has passed. My wife complained to her parents and they are now labelling me as selfish and inconsiderate.

I'm 19 and trans and I'm very openly trans to my friends and to everyone in my college, but not to my family. They're not unaware of my identity though, I had tried to tell them about it multiple times when I was younger because I didn't know what being trans meant and thought there was something wrong with me. They either berated or ignored me so I suppressed these feelings until a therapist helped me put a name to them and what they meant. After realising how conservative my parents are I decided not to bring it up again but continued to dress more 'masculinely' and cut my hair. This year in college I started to fully go by he/they and had people address me by my chosen name. I've never been happier and I feel WAY less anxious than I usually do.

In September I visited my parents again and I had a conversation with my mom about being trans (she actually initiated the topic). She said she thought it was a phase. She told me she really loves me and can't stand the thought of me suffering because of these silly feelings. I calmly explained to her that my life will become way worse if I choose to ignore them instead. After our talk, she apologised and said she can't imagine the pain I had to go through as a child and that she would find someone to help guide her through what it meant to be a parent of a trans child. I thanked her profusely for trying to understand.

This month I'm visiting my parents for the holidays. My mom picked me up from college and since home was a long while away we got to talk a lot again. My gender got brought into question again and I remained patient as I answered all her questions as best as I could. She told me she found someone and understands my situation a lot more now. She still doesn't want me to use hormones and if I ever get a partner who is also male she doesn't want us to have kids (I never wanted kids to begin with). So still not completely there, but the baby steps are what matters. What upset me was when she told me she'll try to learn more about trans people only IF I agree to go to church with them every Sunday.

I am not a Christian and have not been for a very long time, but I know this will upset my parents so I pretend in front of them. However, my mom is very aware that I can't stand attending church. Alot of the churches my family attends are openly against Queer people existing. I haven't been shy from expressing how uncomfortable going to church is for me to my parents, but they just choose to ignore me.

I didn't agree or disagree that I'd attend with them and instead reminded my mom that that's a bit unfair because she knows how much I hate going there. She tells me it's not easy for her to get used to these changes either, the least I could do is suck it up and go to church with them. She keeps on telling me how difficult it is to get used to Queer people since she's only heard about them recently, so I don't know if this is a fair trade or not.

My background is Muslim but my parents always celebrated both religions' holidays. Christmas has always been my favorite time of year and I go all in every time.

My wife and I have been living abroad since we got married (7 years ago) and we only see our respective families once a year. Because of Covid we haven't seen my in-laws in 3 years. This winter break was our only option so we decided to visit them for Christmas.

My in-laws are not exactly good people. Neither my wife nor I are particularly fond of them but we never cut contact because the drama isn't worth it so long as we don't live in the same country. I could do an entire post about all the shit they've done but the bulk of it is : They're very religious (Muslim). My wife and I are agnostics. They accuse me of having ""de-converted"" her and generally despise me. They also recently found out I am bisexual and that my wife and I have had threesomes with men and I am pretty sure they now believe I am the devil (not as a metaphor, like literally the devil came to snatch their daughter or something, I caught echos of my FIL discussing it seriously). My wife doesn't exactly love her parents either. Unfortunately they verbally and physically abused her for all of her teenage years, she had to fight them to get through every life milestone. But we still keep contact so the kids can see their grandparents and to save face (This isn't something taken lightly in these parts of the world, and we don't want to become the talk of the town).

One very weirdly specific hang up they have is that I celebrate ""infidel holidays"". I always knew that, but I'm not exactly shoving a Christmas tree down their rectum so I never thought it would be a major problem. Then on a very weird call, around a week ago, my MIL made it clear that if I was planning on celebrating Christmas this year I better not come. I calmly explained it was a personal matter. Unsurprisingly she wouldn't budge. It became clear quite fast the plan was to stop me from coming so they could just see their daughter and grand kids. I would honestly be all for that plan, but my ILs hilariously underestimate how much their daughter absolutely despises them, she'd never agree to go without me. I tell my wife about her mother's batshit insane ultimatum, she had seemingly had enough and didn't want to argue with her parents so she just tells me to cancel the flights.

So I obliged.

Obviously they were livid when we told them no one was coming. Ranted about us prioritizing a holiday over family. They accused us of being petty. Here's where we might be the assholes, they are right.

He doesn't like showering. He works a physical job and generally wears clothes that tend to retain bad odors. From the very beginning he didn't care to present himself as clean, I would feel his BO and notice when we would spend the weekend together he wouldn't shower at all (not even wipe himself with some baby wipes). He didn't use a deodorant so the smell would be very noticeable after a day, especially two.

So I began telling him ""Hey, I need the bathroom for a while, do you need to shower or something?"" just to hint that a shower is an activity in life. He'd just say no. I did this for some time but ultimately I just became frustrated and started telling him I noticed he doesn't really shower or uses a deodorant. So he started using a deodorant but that didn't really help much as he's one of those people who just have a combined smell of perfume and sweat when using a deodorant (I'm the same, which is why I take care of showering and changing my shirts often, and experimenting with different deos). 

I do not want to force him to use a deodorant as I fully understand people not wanting to use deos filled with chemicals and whatnot. But there are alternatives...like showering and wearing clean clothes, using natural deodorants etc.

We're still in the beginning of our relationship and I would love to be able to cuddle with him or initiate sex without worrying how many times he went to the can without showering. I do not want to have sex with him not washing his ass for two days straight. 

Sometimes he would initiate but I would just say I'm not in the mood. After some time I bluntly told him that if he doesn't shower and he went to take a shit in the meantime, I don't want to have sex with him. I also don't want to cuddle under his smelly armpit either. I told him the same about washing his hands before sex. He'd eat chips and then put his hand in my pants. Yeah, I don't think so. As someone who had big problems down there, this is not debatable.

He didn't change his habits at all and I'm starting to feel like this could be a deal breaker for me. Not necessarily for the smell/cleanliness but more so because he could give two shits about how I feel. And it's not that he doesn't have the time. He comes home around 4, and plays games for 5 hours. But that's whole 'nother story.

I know it's his body and I can't make him shower but is it really too much to ask for your SO to be clean and fresh? And if it bothers me, why is it so hard for him to adopt a habit that is generally considered the norm? Anyway, if you all decide I'm the asshole, I will accept it but it will not change how I feel about his ""habits"" and would probably need to think if I can get over this or not. Thx for reading.

We both work 4 days a week and have 1 day with our son. My boyfriend has lost both his parents a couple of years ago and an unborn child with his previous partner. He’s had a hard time since then. 

Since we’ve moved in together (3 years ago) my boyfriend has had issues with going to the office. We are both people that need space to function, for us that means being alone in the house. I have ADD so I really need my alone time. We agreed we would ‘give’ each other one day a week without the other one home. We also agreed we would be at the office when the other was home with our son. 

My boyfriend always seemed to have a problem that could only be solved by working from home.  He’s had 3 jobs and all 3 jobs have made it ‘impossible’ for him to work at the office. He was reluctant to go because of covid, it was difficult because he had to ask permission to go to the office and now the reason is because he hates his job. 

I’ve also asked him to please leave me alone while working, because I’m easily distracted and need a long time to regain my concentration. He agrees to -and it works for a week- after a week he starts to bother me again. When confronted he always says he is just happy and in the heat of the moment and forgets our agreement. 

Al these years I have tried to ask him to work at the office, I’ve begged, pleaded, tried to talk though his difficulties, but to no avail.

I feel like I have no time alone, because I’m either with the baby or working, and when I’m working from home, he is also home. And he doesn’t leave me alone while I’m working. I’m losing my mind.

I quit my job 1 year ago because I was tired of not sleeping and I wanted to change jobs. Also because we had a lot of fights over the above and I thought that maybe quitting my job and finding some rest at home would help. It was a tough year for me. Also my dad died this summer. My boyfriend did what he could to support me. It included doing 50/50 housework, even though I was home, so I could have done 100%. I’m really grateful for this of course. 

I’ve recently started a new job and I need to study for exams. So I really need my time alone. 

So an hour ago I asked him to please work from the office for two days a week. He agreed and said he would try to work towards it, but that it would take time because it was difficult for him.  I also told me I had to work on trying to learn to concentrate while he is home. He feels as if he is being kicked out of the house. 

I lost it and told him to please start working on his issues because it’s not normal to never go to the office. 

So, aita? I feel like I’m the asshole here because I was home for an entire year and he helped me through it and he is obviously having larger issues here so I should be greatfull for the year he supported me and just suck it up and help him through his issues.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4840182,public,top,self,AITA for asking my boyfriend to work at the office 2 days a week?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8o3qx/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_work_at_the/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I always ignored when they argued because i didnt want to get involved and it felt awkard. One day he told me he broke up with her because she was unfaithfull to him and she was always talking to other boys i just agreed but in my head i thought its not that bad. I just thought he wanted to have an excuse to end it. Few days later  i went to college and was there abit early and a girl i knew came out and said ""emily is crying her eyes out"". So i braced mysef and went in and i she was crying hard and i asked her what was wrong and she screamed""OH LIKE YOU DONT KNOW"" i was like wtf i told her to calm down and she said sorry. She started saying she didnt cheat and was just losing i didnt know what to say i didnt want to cause problems so i told her "" wash your face and calm down its ok"" and she went to do that and she left her phone there and unlocked so i knew it was wrong but i wanted to see her socials to show my freind she isnt a cheater so i went onto instagram and she was logged into a diffrent acc and i saw that it was private and she was talking with boy and cheating according to these dms . I was so angry i felt like smashing the phone she cried out her eyes out because she cheated??? So i took screenshots and sent them to myself and then delete them.

She came back and said sorry and i just mumbled ""yeah"". I didnt know what to do expose her or just delete them and forget it ever happend. But then mark phoned and said he wasnt coming in and asked why and he said ""i dont want to face that bitch"" he didnt want to cause problems so i got pissed and sent him the photos and he was pissed as well. After a long call he was really upset and was trying to hide it but i didnt say anything. Anyway we posted the photos on snapchat and instagram and sent it to our other freinds and they put it on their storys. I felt uneasy abt that i only meant for people we knew to know about how fake she is not randoms

Then i got  messages saying she is getting death threats and horrilblle messages about the situation and i just played dumb and she said "" i know it was you"" and she called me and i answered and i lost my temper that she was still acting inccocent so before she could speak i screamed down the phone"" YOU CHEATED AND YOUR STILL ACTING INNOCENT GO F YOUR SELF. YOU WERE CRYING YOUR EYES OUT AND I FELT BAD AND YOU LIED"". Then i just cut the call and she then sent me messages of some of her dms and they were pretty bad and i felt abit bad but i didnt respond.

My sister's (twenty four), I'll  use the name Kate, husband suddenly fell sick about a week ago. Kate,  understandably is very upset and I get she's going through a tough time.  My parents, especially mom refuse to leave her and niece's side.  Everyone is pretty worried for Kate, and yes I do understand that. I  also called and talked to her. But the issue now is that my mom is  asking me and my fiance to postpone the wedding for a little bit. I said  that's not possible, and it'll be extremely last minute. Me and mom had  a bit of a fight over this, and she eventually said that she won't be  able to attend then.

I was  shocked. I got upset and told her I would like my parents there to  support me at my wedding, but she said to just get a courthouse wedding  then. I replied that she's completely ignoring me to baby Kate.

Mom is pretty mad at me for what I said and didn't answer my calls (she was with Kate no doubt).

Everything is set and I think I deserve to have my parents present at my wedding, and I shouldn't have to postpone.

Some other relatives caught wind and said I should apologize to my mom for lashing out at her, and she's right.

A few of her cousins, an uncle and her brother and SIL have been complaining about her and I leaving family events early, or being a bit checked out during those events. For context, she and I both started new jobs this year (same field) and bring a lot of work home with us, her more than I. Because of this she has been a bit preoccupied during these events and has had to leave a little early. I must say I also play a part in this, as I'm very introverted and long events drain me, and her family have LONG events and make it a competition around who can stay the longest, which Fiance thinks is normal and I think is a bit toxic.

Her mother (MIL) has relayed this to us, and her specifically, especially the complaints from her brother who is annoyed that we don't go to visit them more, and she ""isn't acting like a sister"". They however do not invite us over and don't exactly make Fiance feel very welcome. MIL has suggested that we just need to pop around every weekend or so to appease them, but we are both in the busiest part of our year and completely swamped over the weekends (especially with her family holding an event seemingly every fortnight.)

She wants to avoid drama and to sacrifice more of our free time to her family, where I have suggested that we let them learn to deal with it, this is going to be our lives going forward. Although apparently, I am an AH for suggesting that and she would do the same for my family (who wouldn't ask us to do that.) I like her family and don't want to upset them, but I feel like this is setting us up to be taken advantage of time-wise (especially with her brother and SIL expecting their first within the year.)

We have 3 boys, 2 are toddlers, and keep strict quiet hours between 8pm and 7:30am. We’ve never had a noise complaint before and have lived in the same rental for 7 years (with 4 neighboring families). 

When the kids are awake and at home we do let them run and play in the living room which shares a wall with our neighbor’s living room for 20-30 minutes at a time. Frankly for as little as they are awake and home I think they should be able to within reason. We’re talking 8am to 11am, and 4:30-6. The rest of the time they’re in school, activities, eating meals with us at the table, or engaged with us in things like TV or getting ready for bed. 

Personally, I think our neighbors might just be more aware of the noise because they’re sleep deprived parents of a newborn. Been there, done that. Because we hear them and their TV too from time to time, and assume that’s just part of shared wall living, and pets/kids.

We have a 7 month old daughter. By the time we got to DH parents house we had already skipped a nap or two, but she was going strong. Anyways, MIL grabbed the baby and walked away into the kitchen. I notice my daughter was still crying a moment later and I get up to grab a drink and see if she’s good. She’s still crying, she’s over tired, it’s loud and there are a lot of people that I’ve never met. So I tell MIL “I’ll take her.” MIL says “you can let her cry” so I respond with “She doesn’t need to cry right now.” And I walk back into the living room with my now calm daughter and let DH know that I had just done that and I even mention it to my therapist the next day. 

Fast forward two days, DH is getting reamed out because MIL is saying my daughter wasn’t crying and that I said “I’m taking her before she starts crying” and all of a sudden DH’s 3 sisters are yelling at him about my behavior and claiming that they all witnessed me say that despite not actually being in the room. They go back and forth via text and DH tells me that everything is all my fault because I upset his mother and now I’ve created massive conflict in the family. I explain to him what had happened again and he insists that I should have at least stayed in the room and passed her back once she was soothed. Thing is, I took her back into the living room and put her on where she instantly fell asleep. Once she had woken up later I approached MIL multiple times giving her an opportunity to hold the baby and she did not even look at us. Anyways, his 3 sisters call later that night and I listen to them yell at him (again) about keeping the baby from the family and my inappropriate behavior because they feel like we don’t go to their house frequently enough despite MIL only visiting once in the past 3 months and SILs visiting on average once a month. The SIL who complains the most is the one who lives a 4 hour flight away. 

Last time MIL visited she was upset our daughter cried when she held her. She then took the dog home with her for the night (dog used to live with them). 

Anyways, because I literally cannot continue with this I sent them a lengthy text which I’ll post for those who care. I will also post their response where they expressed that they have concerns and I need to respect them “as aunties”. I’ve also attached screenshots of my convo with my partner. I am doing this because I am absolutely at my wits end and I’m being as transparent as possible because they literally paint me as the worst person.

I asked my boyfriend if he would be okay with staying with Terry while I went to work. He said that he would be fine, but I know that if the tables were turned, then I would like him to stay with me. On top of that, if I go to work,  Danny would have to ask one of our friends or relatives to give him a ride home (8 minute drive).

On one hand, I think that I should go to work, as the hospital only needs one of us to stay with Terry and bf said he would be okay. I have also been trying to maintain my performance at work, as I had just started there a couple months ago. On the other hand, I don’t want to leave him alone and have him find his own way home.

I'm a second-year undergrad college student, and when we started our degree in first year it was covid times, so our lectures were all online. In order to give us a chance to interact with each other, a discord server was set up. Since then, the class server has remained a place for us to communicate, ask questions and post resources. I'm a moderator, and we keep things civil.

There's a girl in the class ""Kayla"" who ran against me in the class rep elections last year. I got the job, but she was never happy about it. She also took part in a little argument I won't get into here which made me start to dislike her. As a class rep a lot of students came to me for help including her, but while I considered ignoring her I put my opinions to one side and helped her anyway.

This year, Kayla ran for class rep again. This began bothering me when she began trying find fault in everything I said on the server, like she was trying to prove she'd be a way better rep than me, even though I wasn't running again. She didn't win, but I started to notice that she was asking for a lot of help on the server, more than most. I even helped her a couple times.

After every lecture Kayla asks on the server how far we got in the slides. This annoys me because while some lectures are better than others, she asks the same question every week for nearly every lecture, relying on people who actually go to them for her study because she can't be bothered to go herself. I freely acknowledge my bias toward her, but it got to the point yesterday that when she asked, I said she should just go to the lectures. I then told her what we covered to try and diffuse any hostility.

She attacked me saying it was better to read the stuff in her own time and that all I had to do was not answer, using the c-word to refer to me. We don't have a problem swearing in our server, but this is the first time someone used this word and several people had negative reactions. I don't use it in my everyday life as I think it's very offensive. I told her not to blow things out of proportion, that I was making a suggestion and for her to do what she likes. Someone else called her out for her rudeness, and she replied, ""if the shoe fits..."". I didn't engage but to say I was offended is an understatement. The rest of the day she kept asking loads of questions, and I realised just how much she actually relies on the server for help and resources, even though she is ""self-motivated"" and doesn't need the lectures.

I think she crossed a line and that I could ban her from the server. I wouldn't have to deal with her, and she wouldn't have access to all the resources and be able to ask for loads of help. But I feel this is a tad drastic and would do more harm than good, and I am obviously biased of course. I do want to take some sort of action against her but am conflicted as to whether or not it's worth it.

We earn different incomes now that we started working. Partner A earns 40% partner B 60%. We live comfortably and both save money but B can save more.

We have always split everything 50:50. A now wants to split 40:60 as B has gotten a pay increase leading to the 40:60 ratio.

I (B) do not want to split 40:60 until we move into a bigger flat, have more expenses or increase our general living standard.

I know her situation well and I know my friend needs this money more than her 5 minutes of hitting balls together. She can play many more games, whenever, no matter what. 

Apparently, she was fixed on that one game. Mind you while we were waiting she was also playing at the other table. Claiming she never agreed on giving up her place for the money even though she already took the $10 which is her half of the $20. 

The man refused a refund. Stating that deal has been done. She starts getting emotional and frustrated, then caused a scene. Starts getting in his face and calling him names. He asks for the money back considering he wasn't expecting so many issues to arise over a simple agreement. 

I understand that I should've talked to her before agreeing but to me and everyone else the $20 is worth a lot more than playing a game in no one will care about or remember the next day.

I (16F) have an English teacher that I'll deem mrs S. I get gifts for my teachers or the ones that taught me this year. The gifts were little succulents (eg cactus) in a toilent with 'Kak tis' meaning 'this shit' or 'shit this'.

I had a to choose subjects this year and don't have some of the teachers I like next year so but she's the only English teacher from gr 9 up. She often gave extra work not for marks but for prep for studying or a creative writing on things we learnt in gr 4 and have used for 5 years now when we were studying for exams. A part of the reason I dislike her is she'd treat me like an alien and would sit infront of me on an empty desk watching me like I was in a zoo.

She never looked at our work or books even got us to buy a book we didn't touch the whole year and later took it off the list for next year so I can't resell it to the school it was expensive too. She made us rewrite tests on terminology over and over until she forgot (2 weeks daily) or if she moved onto new work. I got tired of it quick and stopped doing work she'd forget about and never check if she did.

So I did the gifts and went to the teachers lounge to put their gifts in their cubie box thing (where they get printed sheets they needed to print but had class so they couldn't) and put them in and left after having a good giggle with my Afrikaans teacher about the 'kak tis'.

I started to let my bigger person and the nice side get to me thinking it was a dbag move and now I feel bad but she made the year a hell scap that even I couldn't rangle. My mom while asking who I wanted to give to asked if I was sure and I said yes I was sure now I'm not. I feel bad but I don't she just ticks me off and is extra but she still tried teaching my class no matter how many times she'd yell at use to take notes even if we already wrote it down earlier in the year or if she didn't see us take them down.

My sister (27f), is excited every year for Christmas presents, and she has that Christmas fever that I hate. It is very difficult for me to save money, since I only work on summer holidays. Every year I somehow managed to find money for presents. Last year I was a bit difficult again with money, but I bought a present for my boyfriend (29m) that was about 25€(!!), and she complained that I could only give 10€/present but got my boyfriend a 25€ present. I felt reaaallyy weird, since it is none of her business how I manage my money.
This year however, I really have only 10€ on my debit card, and I told her that I cannot participate this year, neither I have the money to buy a present for my bf but she doesn't know that. My brother (30m) totally understand me and supports me, but she asked me if I am gonna buy my bf a present. I told her it's not her business, and she told it is because she believes that I have the money for the presents for the family and instead I am gonna buy a present for my bf.

I told the guy I would send him photos the next day once I had them. However the next morning I was quite hungover and I also had to pack for a trip, as I was catching a flight the next day.

After a couple of days, I honestly forgot that I said I would send him formal photos, however, I did post a few photos to my Instagram. The boy reminded me that I still hadn't sent him photos, so I told him to go on to my Instagram to check them out, which he refused to do because I said that I would send him photos. He never ended up liking the post or saying anything about the photos. I knew he would have seen them as he views my Instagram stories. After that, I was a bit depressed that he didn't say anything as I liked him at the time, but I understand where he was coming from.

In all honesty, I did forget that I said I'd send photos to him, as during the formal night I was trying to be in the moment, and the days after that were quite busy.

Last year, my sister (we’ll call her Anna) brought her new boyfriend (Jacob) to our family Christmas dinner which was the first time most of us had met him, myself included. We were all thrilled, Anna had been suffering with severe mental illness since her late teens so it was fantastic to see her beginning to move on with her life and seek out recovery and change. 

An issue arose was when it became glaringly obvious Jacob was not privy to the true extent of her illness. For some background, Anna was unable to finish her college education due to a severe psychotic break which landed her in a psychiatric unit for 6~ months. She has since been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder (Bipolar Type) and has been properly medicated and regularly attends counselling sessions, even being able to land a job at a local supermarket (where she met Jacob). Regardless of my feelings towards this, I was happy for Anna and maintained a cordial relationship with the two, letting Anna open up to Jacob at her own pace. 

Fast forward to May of this year, Anna’s mental state had rapidly deteriorated yet again. She stopped taking her medication, attending her counselling sessions. Things completely spiralled out of control when she began to lash out at customers at work; she was accusing them all sorts of bizarre things (such as following her home and watching her through cameras, which obviously was not true). This ended up with her being ‘let go’ from her job and ending up in another psychiatric facility. Jacob was absolutely torn. I supported him best I could, however he cut things off with Anna. I respected his decision, especially considering how unprepared he was for this seeing as Anna was not wholly honest about her past and diagnoses. 

In the following months, things progressed between Jacob and I until we came to be in a relationship of our own. He was everything I’d ever wanted in a man, compassionate and gentle but with a perfect sense of humour. We’d clicked immediately upon our first conversation, however, we had more time to bond with each other with Anna’s absence. We both missed her terribly, and gave each other comfort in these trying times.

Now, Anna has been deemed fit to be discharged from hospital. She will be staying with our parents for a while, before she’s settled back into being a member of society. My parents are supportive of Jacob and I, however my mother is insistent I do not let Anna know. This is deeply distressing to both me and my boyfriend, I was looking forward to attending this year’s Christmas dinner with him and it wouldn’t feel right not having him there.

He would go in and on about how horrible and sad of a person he was, and anytime I would try to console him (maybe work to be less reactive, try to see the best parts of yourself etc) he would get mad at me, and started too heavily resent me and saying I was his problem before backpedaling and saying it was his fault.

I explained this to her, and told her I don’t have time for insecure people like that. She got upset at me and called me a cold, mean person. I snapped at her, saying “If your insecurities cause you to resent and lash out at people, then you have no sympathy from me.” I then raised my voice saying that I didn’t care what she thinks, what he was doing was abusive.

She treats them like they were her infant kids (although I won't let my toddler do half the sh.. they do) and calls them her babies just like my children are my babies.

And that's the point where I might be the asshole: I feel like I'd be acting ungrateful because she let us live with her without a fuss and I'd deny her a ""simple thing"" such as bringing her dogs.

To start off with some background me and my friend let's call her Jenny (fake name obviously for privacy);met eachother when I was 7 and she was 8 we weren't close back then but basically throughout my primary school  we were not very close because I was known for being bullied by everyone including her other good friends at the time. 

But as soon as we got to 6&amp;7th grade she would constantly call me her best friend so we became close again. 
 
Heres were the problem starts recently she has gotten a boyfriend let's call him harry (for private reasons) so Jenny and Harry used to hate each other because of some issues they had but they recently started dating right after Harry started bullying me and some of my friends. 

I found this weird and a bit upsetting because this gave him more chances to bully me when he was around her and she wouldn't do anything of it, but I ignored that for awhile until recently a close friend of ours told me Jenny and 3 other close friends a very personal emotional secret about something that happened to her, and told all of usnot to share it. 

So all was find at first nothing got told for a week or so, but then one time me and my friend who told us the secret got pulled out of class for something and when we came back there was a lot of whispering about my friend. 

So we decided to Ignore that until Harry, jennys boyfriend came up to us and straight up asked my friend about her secret, of course she denied it but then he said that, Jenny had told him and his friends, my friend broke down we left class with another close friend and took her home, she refuses to come back to school now and I'm really pissed at Jenny because now a lot of people know this and it was very personal to her. 

She's also not coming to school anymore out of Ethier Embarrassment or just so she doesn't have to face the consequence of all our friend group hating her now.

After my mother's car ran into repeated issues with her old car. My mother, brother and I shared this car with my mother almost never using it due to health issues. 

A few months ago, my mother passed away from cancer. And we decided to put the car in my brothers name because he was older and thus had cheaper insurance.  But it was made clear me and my brother still shared it. We both putted dates we needed the car in the agenda so there wouldn't be conflict and whoever claims it first gets to use.  

This weekend, I have the car claimed to go to a birthday of a family member of my girlfriend. And my brother last minute got invited to celebrate something else at his girlfriends house. So he started arguing with me at the dinner table because his girlfriend lives an hour away and mine 25 minutes. Trying to force me to borrow my aunts old car so he can take ours saying that he owns the car.

My father didn't get involved too much, but said it was a good solution since he has a longer drive. The past weeks when he had the car claimed. I found different solutions for myself to visit my girlfriend, so I don't think me having to give up the car is fair. 

This is one of multiple incidents. 

 I have been wanting to buy my own car for about 6 months. However my parents dissagreed since we just got a new car and it wouldn't be used enough if I wasn't driving it making it a waste of money. 

However due to the issues with sharing on the weekends. (The only time I usually actually need it, though im the only one that sometimes drives it on weekdays) I have decided to go look for my own car since this will probably just keep happening. 

Would I be the butthole for buying my own car?

I (F23) catch the train to work every day, and it is pretty normal to see some people sleeping rough in the train stations. If I have a spare couple of dollars, I will generally offer to buy someone a cup of coffee or a hot pie from the convenience shop in the train station. Especially around Christmas, I really try and help people out as I am sure that their bit in life is not easy.

While I do not do this every day, it is a pretty normal thing for me and I have gotten to semi-know the people sleeping rough in the train station where I get on on the way to work.

Today, though, I saw a man (30s-40s) I had never seen before sitting with one of the ladies I have seen quite often, but he came and stood on the platform while everyone on their daily commute were waiting for the train to arrive.

He began asking for change, and I wasn't paying too much attention, but I don't think many (if any) people gave him anything. By the time he got to me, he asked for change and I shook my head no. I didn't have any cash and a cup of coffee wasn't in my budget today as I have some big bills coming up this month.

The man proceeded to rip my headphones out of my ears and tell me that I was a elitist not-nice-word-to-call-a-woman (not sure if I am allowed to swear on this sub), and that his friend had told him I would give him some change but that I probably only gave change to women. He said that people like me were the reason he couldn't get back on his feet, and that I probably stole food out of the mouthes of male children.

My eyes were like saucers the entire time - I was in such shock. It was at this point that another commuter (M30s-40s) stepped in basically told the homeless man to leave me alone and that he wasn't entitled to anyone's change. The homeless man left, but not before throwing his bottle of water at me (thankfully I was not hit or wet in any way).

I thanked the other commuter, but have not been able to get the homeless man's words out of my mind. I try and be generous when I can, and I feel like I could have probably spared him a couple of dollars.

I spoke to a colleague (F29) about it, and she said that we never know people's stories and should be as compassionate as possible. She said that we don't know what kind of night he had, and a little bit of kindness always goes a long way.

Raised in a Christian mega church, phased out, came out as gay and moved out of my family’s house at 18. After a few years, my music career started taking off, I made amends with and moved back home with the family to pay less rent/have somewhere easy to touch base between tours - while I could of course. 

My parents (50 &amp; 51) are accepting of me, for the most part. I probably put up with more than I should just to maintain my cheap rent. They’ll be formal with my boyfriends, but it’s more of a masked ‘we’re shining lights of God to these lost gays’ than it is a traditional ‘meet the parents’. I’m in my 20s and can’t have partners over/in private. Even if I just wanted to have a non physical movie night - my lifestyle isn’t welcome in the house. I can eat, sleep and hang out but that’s all.

These details seem kind of pointless as I type, but idk I guess I’m just painting a picture as to what the relationship is really like. Im very close to my mom, we are a like in every way aside from politically - and I get annoyed when she politicizes my sexuality to no end. But they’re from the Midwest, never got out much once they moved to the west coast, and have always just been in their bubble. I learned early on to just let it be and live my life away from all of that. 

Anyways, my brother (22) just got engaged to his gf of a year. My mom told me out of the blue, and said to keep my September tour schedule open because he was gonna ask me to be his best man. Without much hesitation I asked “would he return the favor and be my best man when the time comes? Would any of you”? To which she said: “well no son, and it’s not because we don’t love you. It’s because we all know what constitutes an actual marriage”. 

I asked her if we could switch the topic, and told her that we’re not gonna see eye to eye so we should just move on. She said the family was going to be hurt, and I told her that I would probably feel worse having zero family members at my inevitable wedding and asked her to consider what she was saying for just a second. 

She mentioned tradition and sanctity again and this is where I kind of snapped. I said the least I could do was buy them a wedding gift. I also said that the only reason they were tying the knot after a year of dating isn’t because god told them it was time, it’s that their guilty hormones told them it was time to bang. And that if she thought god looked down kindly on her loveless, sexless, argumentative marriage, she’s more deranged than I originally thought. 

That last part hurt her. But I don’t feel like I did anything besides give her a taste of the medicine she’s fed me for my whole life. I love my family, and I appreciate them being there and doing their best (eh) to understand and accept. But I’m not gonna sit through a service filled with people that revel in the thought I’m going to hell.
