The few times I've actually tried taking him up on his offer to help have been times when I physically couldn't move something on my own. Hes at least twice my size and works out daily, very strong so it wouldn't be a problem for him he says.

Maybe I'm over reacting, but it feels like he just wants control of the situation and has no intention of ever lifting a finger to help.

Over three years ago, my brother was constantly couch surfing. I lived in a 3 bedroom trailer that I had just finished paying off. I told him he can stay there free of rent until he gets on his feet. We had just had our daughter after trying for 6 years. During his time staying at the trailer with us he starting talking about moving to Minneapolis because he had better job opportunities there.

He moved there a few months into the pandemic. He didn’t find a job. He was couch surfing again. I called him a few times to make sure he was ok and to encourage him. After a few months, he called my wife and told her he wants to come back.

he was broke we sent him $700 to get a uhaul to drive back. We were still living in the trailer and in the process of buying a house. We finally signed for the house and moved in while my wife was 6 months pregnant with our second child.

Eventually I found out he was renting a storage unit for all his extra stuff and paying around $150 a month. We had a verbal agreement to go get it and put his stuff in our storage room and he could just pay me $100 a month. 

Around the time that the wife hit 8 months, she took maternity leave. So I asked my brother to try and chip in with the bills. I asked for $150. He said he can’t afford that. The next month, our boy came and at hour 13 he was being flown to a childrens hospital almost 5 hours away. We were there for two months.

He calls me three days before we come home and starts just random conversation and that he has come back a couple of times to feed the cats. I ask what do you mean “come back to feed the cats?” He tells me he moved out a month ago. Didn’t even ask about his nephew. We finally get home to find the kitchen full of dirty dishes and his room a mess. 

It’s almost been 2 years since we pulled his stuff out of storage with no payments from him. He stopped by once to get a laptop from his stuff. At the beginning of November, I sent him a text saying that he owes me $2000 for storage alone and I need to use that room. He has until the end of November to pay or I’m taking his stuff to the landfill. At this point I’ve already considered it abandoned.  

Yesterday, he shows up with a uhaul truck and a cop.  Cop starts the conversation with “My understanding is that he moved out recently, I am here to make sure that no issues come up”. 
I told the cop he hasn’t paid for the storage and it wasn’t recent at all. I start telling the officer my side of the story and brother keeps trying to butt in while I’m talking to the point the cop tells him to shut up.

Me: Busy right now.
I walk into the classroom, and sit down, and check my bank account because i needed to do a little budgeting with my bank account, I finish up, and begin talking with one of the worker, we’re in the middle of a conversation, when this client I had shortly spoke with walked in, and does this.  Same people as before, except M is Staff Member.

Him: I got new Joycons on Monday.
I immediately looked at him, and snapped at him, because he interrupts a lot of the time, and I had had enough.

Me: We were in the middle of a conversation!

M: We were.
This client apologized, the problem is his apologies are worthless since he keeps doing this all the time.

So, AITA for being short with this client and snapping at him after I had enough.

That being said she has an extremely flexible schedule and goes out most nights of the week. She spends lavishly on food/drink, events, and designer clothes. I will say she has been very generous, taking me out to eat on several occasions. I've also helped her out by taking care of her dog while she's out of town multiple times and helping her unpack her closet the first time.

So my friend  is moving ""down the hall"" in her full-city-block-sized apartment complex and doesn't want to hire movers, instead she's asking all her friends (as far as I know I am still her only female friend in town) to come help her move. She only has a couple of big pieces of furniture (king sized bed, sectional couch, dresser, and then just ""little things"" like end tables, chairs, and like 30 pieces of wall art, kitchenware and appliances, etc.  The thing is that she refuses to take any steps at all to make it easier for anyone: she will not rent a cart, wagon, or dolly. She said maybe she can borrow 1 dolly from her neighbor. She also has spoken a lot about putting things in bins she already has, which I think means she does not have containers to carry everything at once, so she intends to have us fill up bins in her old apartment, carry them to her new apartment, empty them, then repeat. She scoffed when I suggested she start the packing process as soon as possible so it wouldn't be too overwhelming on moving day.

I told her I have a bad back so she begrudgingly said that I can just carry some of the lighter stuff, and instead focus on packing up her kitchen and closet for her. I don't believe she intends to do any of the hard work herself. On top of this she has been dating this very toxic man on and off, I've told her I don't want to be around him, but she still said he'd probably come help the effort. Keep in mind, I never actually offered to help, she just acts like it's assumed that I owe this to her. (I don't know if it's worth mentioning, but despite my own lack of money, I have always sprung for movers and never asked anyone for help moving because I would feel weird asking friends to do that much manual labor for me for free)

Earlier this week I witnessed her on the phone with the apartment manager talking about the move and she agreed to a $50/month surcharge on her new apartment because she didn't want to hustle and start the moving process six days earlier. So she agreed to an extra $50/month in perpetuity. I know she has the money to make this easier on everyone but she says it would be ""too expensive"" to get proper moving stuff, she never actually asked me for help, she just assumed I would, and I don't want to be forced to be around her creepy man. And honestly, this sounds like a chaotic, physically grueling, miserable experience, and it seems like too much to ask.But she is a friend and has treated me to nights out on multiple occasions.

I know he is busy in meetings and goes out for company dinners and such in evenings, thats not the problem.

We’ve never adopted before, and of course it is a very long and difficult process, but we were so excited at all the progress we’ve made. We recently were able to set up an appointment to meet our prospective son and his foster parents. We have been so excited and have even started calling him “our little mister.” Everything was perfect- until recently, when we had this conversation. 

For some context: I entered our relationship with a daughter, “S,” who was a little under one year old at the time. (S is now 4.) Ever since we started dating, M has treated S like her own child, and especially since we’ve been really serious, she has referred to S as her daughter. Recently, M even insisted that I refer to S always as her daughter, not her “step”daughter. I was more than happy to agree to this and honestly just so grateful that S gets to have two equally loving parents.

But earlier today, while S was napping, I JOKINGLY asked M if she would love our son more than our daughter once we brought him home (I realize that this question wasn’t really funny and probably came out of a subconscious anxiety I’ve been harboring). M responded “yes” in a very serious tone. To be fair, M can have a really dry humor, so I said something along the lines of “lol you’re joking right?” But she just doubled down. Now she’s insisting that it only makes sense that she would love our son more “since he will be hers too” and I’m seriously reconsidering whether we can go through with this adoption. M thinks I’m an AH for taking her comment to the point of not adopting a child, but as a mother I have to protect the wellbeing of my daughter. I just don’t know what to do.

Yet, despite all the decades she has consistently been sidelined by the family. Her own sister is invited to events but she isn’t. I’m talking like Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter. I got fed up with this and I began inviting her to events our family hosts. We will do our own little Thanksgiving, Christmas, or other meet up events.

I countered that in the law of the land and god rest his soul, my dead uncle that she is his legal daughter.

That means we all are pretty much friends with each other.

But at the time of these events my friends A and B were having some problems and A wanted to step back from their relationship a little. A wanted to throw a christmas party but didn't want to invite B. They asked everyone who was invited to not tell about the party to B (B is someone who might not take it so easy being left out, or might not understand where A is coming from). But, as you might guess B found out by someone accidentally asking them if they were coming to the party or not.

The next day I  was openly in our classroom wondering how bad the situation might be. There were a few class mates around, all who know the people involved and know about some of the problems A and B were having. I asked questions like ""has anyone heard from A, are they ok?"" ""is B angry?"" and generally ""what's the situation now?"". And together we, in a respectful manner, talked about our individual experiences and difficult encounters with B and some of the reasons we know why A didn't want to invite B.

In my personal opinion this conversation was quite respectful and neutral. Simply stating facts and truths about the situation and not at all bad mouthing or disrespecting anyone. 

In the opposite classroom sat C working and hearing the conversation. On the next day C came to me telling that they had heard our conversation and was concerned and offended by it. C claimed our conversation was offensive rude and inappropriate to be having at school. C also thought it might have been ok to talk with the people that were around when B found out about the party but not with others. 

I was confused and said that in my opinion adults should be able to state facts about other people even when they are not around, as long as they are true. C did not let me finish and interrupted me by saying that that makes it even worse because I'm belittling the severity of the bullying. Now keep in mind, C did not have a conversation with B about the situation so they did not know how B was feeling. Even I at this point don't know what's really going on between A and B. I just felt bad about the secret keeping and wanted to know how everyone was feeling. For all I know B might be just fine and has something better to do that weekend anyways.

All in all I think it was a mistake to keep the party a secret but I do understand were A was coming from making that decision.

I’ve always known the date of the wedding but never the time until 2 days ago.
 So quick weekly timeline, Tuesday I am told the time of the wedding after asking repeatedly and also asking why I didn’t get an invite. I was told that they forgot to send invites and turned it into a fb invite in which I’m not friends with them on FB so I didn’t get an invite. On Wednesday, I get a text from my stepmom saying they want all siblings at the rehearsal dinner and she forgot to tell us prior to now and that she thinks it’s because their last minute jitters are kicking in (makes no sense how their jitters affected her memory). She also says now they want us all to stay and be in pictures after the wedding. She has 4 kids and my dad has me and my brother. My brother won’t be at the wedding because he is going to a friends wedding that day. My dad won’t be at the dinner because he has to work. My dad and step mom have been together for 14-15 years and I’m 30. My brother is 26. My step brother that’s getting married is 25. We are all adults. 

I feel like I was an afterthought and I don’t want to go just because my dad said something about us not being included and now we are suddenly included. I don’t speak to my step siblings much, especially not the one getting married and one of my step sisters.

I teach sixth grade English.

Today, I taught all of my classes a lesson over a writing strategy with an acronym we have been learning all week (RADD). We have been going over a letter of the acronym each day.

Most of my classes have been doing very well with this. My 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th period were all very attentive and all of them at least started or even finished today’s assignment after I went over today’s letter and did an example with them. For the kids that didn’t finish, I could reasonably set aside 15 minutes of class time tomorrow and they should be able to finish it, if they don’t after that then it will be homework.

I have a difficult 6th period class. I have an aide that helps me manage their behavior every day, and the students are often more interested in socializing than learning.

Today, the students were having an especially difficult time getting settled at the beginning of class. We had to enter and re-enter the room 4 times until they were able to successfully get their supplies and stay on task. This took away lesson time. I let students know after that they needed to be extremely attentive, as they still had work that needed to be completed after we went over our writing strategy today. I told them that if we were unable to get to it, their assignment would need to be completed as homework. They also need their textbooks for it, so that would mean they would have to carry them home.

I don’t think the students believed me because I almost never assign homework, so sure enough, I was continuously interrupted and had to continue correcting disruptive behavior such as getting out of seats without permission and throwing items. I ended up finishing my lesson about two minutes before the bell, and I told the students that because of their actions, we were unable to complete the lesson in the same amount of time as the other classes and they would have to take their textbook home to help them complete their Google Classroom homework.

The kids were *very* upset. I reminded them that I told them what would happen at the beginning of class if they didn’t straighten up, and that since the other classes had either made some headway or started, there was no excuse that they couldn’t have, either.

Kids told me they had no devices on to do it at home (the school provides laptops that stay at school). I told them they were welcome to finish it at morning or after school tutorials if that was the case. They can also come use their textbook and laptop if they have some spare time in another class. So, they definitely have options.

Still, the kids were very upset and I can’t help but feel a little guilty because they’re the only ones that received it.

i was 13 years old when i was going trough an extreme depression phase and i had no one to talk to so i made an instagram account solely for the purpose of talking to other people who were struggling. one day, a girl texted me and we started talking. we talked everyday and even tho she lived around 3000 km away, we started dating. the only problem? she was 19. 

it was a very controlling relationship on top of the grooming. if i didn’t respond for 2 minutes, she’d blow up my phone. if i spoke up for myself on a call, she would give me the silent treatment and just listen to my anxiety attacks for hours and hours on end and wouldn’t let me hang up.

we were on and off for like 4 times and after a year and a half, i started losing feelings and i gained feelings for my best friend. i don’t really remember what happened, but we kissed on a trip together, multiple times. i felt so bad i told her we needed a break and eventually i told her what happened with him. we tried for around 3 weeks, but i broke it off bcs i felt like i wasn’t being fair.

My brothers are my best friends and the first people I came out to. They accepted me right away and yeah, I love them. 

They are “cooler” than me though and well everyone in general never believes we’re siblings (even though we look alike and I’m with them almost 24/7 but whateves). 

The incident:

I was out with my brothers while we were getting groceries for our mom. I then noticed three girls watching us and glaring. I pointed them out to my brothers who told me that one of the girl’s had a thing with one of them. We just laughed and moved on.

My brothers then secretly ran off (a joke they love to play on me whenever we go to Walmart) and I was looking for them when the girls stood in front of me.

I tried to move past them but they were all like “Who are you? How do you know the boys?”

I said I was their sister and they went “oh right I forgot they had a f slur sister.” 

They all then started giggling and told me that I must be adopted. They also said stupid shit about how I’m freakishly tall. I told them that they were being weird and walked off. 

My brothers found me and when they noticed that I was upset I told them what happened. 

My brother that used to date? Hook up? Idk whatever with the one girl found them still watching us and walked up to them and yelled so much that someone had to tell him to leave. My other brother said some things too. 

I thought that was it but the girls found my insta, made a gc, and collectively called me a fucking bitch for snitching and setting my brothers on them. They claimed that I overreacted and they didn’t deserve to be embarrassed, humiliated and yelled at like that. They said that I know what my brothers are capable of and that I really did all that over a conversation between a couple girls. 

In my defence, they were low key bullying me and my brothers didn’t actually do anything to them except yell. But I guess I could’ve just dealt with this myself instead of involving them.

My parents are divorced and both remarried, so I am inviting my mum, stepfather, stepbrother, and my dad and his wife (we'll call her Amanda). 

Me and my dad get along well, but we're not close, and haven't been since we got together with our respective partners (he's never liked my husband, I've never liked his wife), because his trying to force a relationship between me and Amanda and her kids drove a wedge between us. We enjoy each other's company, but we rarely see each other since I moved abroad and keep things very surface level. Amanda and I are cordial on the rare occasion we cross paths (maybe thrice a year in the last 4 years). 

Since this is the first year my husband and I live in the country we hope to settle in, I decided to host Christmas, and I invited my dad and, by extension, Amanda. I didn't expect my dad to come, since Amanda has three kids of her own, one severely disabled (Lucy), but he accepted the offer. He asked if Amanda could bring Lucy since it would be impossible to travel without her, I said yes. 

When I spoke to my dad, I told him that our apartment is not big enough for everyone to stay because my mum, stepdad and stepbrother would be staying over, so I would make hotel reservations not far from our apartment. My dad said this was fine. A few days later, my dad called asking if there was any way he, Amanda, and Lucy could stay at our apartment instead, since traveling with Lucy was very difficult and the stimulating environment of a busy hotel and accessibility issues would be hard to manage. I reiterated there wasn't any space. My dad accepted this and said he may come alone to Christmas in that case, or not at all, and I was said I was fine with either.

Another few days go by and I get a call from Amanda, livid that I wouldn't let them stay at our apartment after my dad explained the issues. Amanda said I should have had my mum, stepdad, and stepbrother stay at the hotel instead for the few days she and Lucy and my dad would be there, because of Lucy's special needs. She said it was appalling that she should have to spend Christmas without her husband or be stressed over the holidays because I'm so spoilt I refuse to compromise. I told Amanda that my courtesy invite to her as a plus one, who had herself intended to bring a plus one, didn't really necessitate a compromise, whether she was there and who she spent Christmas with wasn't my concern. I told my dad the same when I spoke to him, and gave him a deadline to decide whether he was coming.

My husband says I was absolutely right not to put myself out for people I wasn't concerned with seeing anyway, but my mum and stepdad think it was harsh, since they could have stayed a few days at the hotel and come to the apartment after my dad and co had left.

Now, to say I don't like parties would be an understatement: I really dislike them and they drain my social battery very quickly. Nevertheless, I quickly came to terms with it as I knew my GF (20F) would want me to come.  


A few days later, people started talking about having a theme for the party in the group chat. At first, it seemed to be in a jokey way, as I had never imagined people would want to dress up for New Year's. Because of this, I did not really respond. Then they started to become more serious about it. After a while though, they seemed to have been talking IRL while I wasn't there (because I don't live in their house while my GF and her siblings do), and settled on ""Glitter &amp; Glamour"" as a theme. Even though they know I don't feel comfortable dressing up, they still sent an (in my eyes, although it might not have been intended that way) 'demanding' message in the group chat stating that that would be the theme, not asking for any other input from me or anyone else. For me, this felt like they just expected me to buy something and wear it, even though they never asked me whether I would even want that.  


I really did not appreciate this and I quickly decided I just wouldn't do it. I'd still wear something nice of course, but I would simply not buy and wear something that makes me uncomfortable, especially not because they never asked me. After my GF asked me about it and I told her I wouldn't wear glitter, she was and still is, quite upset about it. She feels like I could just wear it for one day to not stand out. After she kept asking me about it, I told her I would also never ask her to wear something she does not want to wear, especially not to 'fit in'. She sort of gave in, saying that I'd have to be the one to tell her parents.  


The part where I might be the asshole is that I indeed never told them (and still don't really plan to, unless they asked me)  I don't want to wear something themed. I possibly could have right when they started to become serious about it, but by the time I read it, they already decided there was gonna be a theme, just not which theme. I figured if they'd want me to dress up while knowing I'm uncomfortable with it, they should ask me directly, and not just expect me to do it based on a random announcement in a group chat.

K and I decided to do oboe together and we are the only 2 oboists in the band. I’ve been friends with K for 4 years now and we’ve been pretty close. But, oboe honestly has knocked me down. I’ve had multiple breakdowns over this long piece of fucking wood and I know it sounds ridiculous but it’s been incredibly stressful. We have a concert in a couple of weeks and I’ve been playing oboe since September and I still can’t truly get a grip on it. We have this winter concert where we’re performing sheltering sky, christmas fantasia, and holly and the ivy. I’ve been taking a private oboe lesson once a week and yet I still can’t truly get a grip on these pieces. I also have this problem where I’m too scared to play with the band because I feel like I’ll be too loud and sound bad. The only time I can play well is by myself when nobodies watching and it’s so fucking annoying. But, guess who doesn’t have this problem? K.

K can play practically all the pieces to perfection whilst I sit there struggling. She always tried to tell my “I got this!” When she knows fully well I fucking don’t. Every time in band class I want to literally burst into tears because everyone can play so much better and it makes me feel so useless. Why can K play so much better than me when we’ve been playing for the same amount of time? It’s not fair. It’s not fair how she has more friends than me, practically prettier than me, and even better than the one thing I’m truly interested in than me. This same things always happens where people are always smarter than me, prettier, and just overall better. I wish I could say I finish 2nd place, but it’s not even 2nd. I finish 30th. 

She’s just so much better than me so last week I decided to end it. I texted her and explained to her how I feel. She asks me if we could talk about this in person and I said no because I can’t see myself being able to deal with this anymore. Around 4 days later she texted me again asking on how she could improve and if she even did anything wrong? I told her “no, you did nothing wrong.” Because she truly didn’t.

We’ve been arguing quite a lot and have had many emotionally charged conversations because of it. Some of the arguments got to the point where I got worried he wanted to leave me due to how upset he was with our situation and I made the mistake twice I think in asking during a fight if he still wanted to be with me. He’d answer with an ”I don’t know”, but after we’d calmed down and managed to talk it over, he’d tell me he didn’t mean it and that it came from a place of frustration and anger of the continuos issues. Right now I’m starting therapy and we’ve talked about going together aswell. Things have been looking up a bit and it feels like weare moving past this. I know what we need is some quality time together, no arguments and no drama. 

So today we were spending the evening together after a really nice day, everything was going great. We had just finished and episode of a show, but something was on my mind. I asked him if he’d ever ACTUALLY considered leaving me during our rough patch and if he’d ever really meant it when he said I don’t know. He told me he had never. I went on to talk about how we need to avoid that kinda talk during arguments, because it only made things worse for us. He agreed, but didn’t want to discuss it further. He got a little upset I ”ambushed” him with the topic after a nice day together and told me I need to stop picking at the past, because we need some time away from all the negativity. I get that, but also I feel like we need to be able to talk about our issues openly. But he went to have a shower to disengage. Now I feel like I might have been TA, because I caused him to have a bad ending to a good day with my questions.

Throwaway

Ex husband (51) and I (52) have been divorced for 15 years. We had 50/50 custody of our daughter(18)  (2/2/3 ). I waived child support. I agreed to cover them on my insurance and he agreed to cover daycare/camp. We agreed to split all other expenses +  to alternate tax years claiming daughter as a dependent. 

He stopped paying for daycare and camps after the second year because he didn’t need coverage on his days.  I had agreed to pay for his/her insurances based on him paying for her daycare/camps on my days. I dropped his coverage but maintained hers ($400 a month) and had to eat the cost of daycare/camps. 

Each year the 50/50 creeped into more for me and less for him…Sports (she played 3-4  a year), clothes, school lunch, etc. 

In 2020 she came to live with me full time. 

She’s now away at college (Freshman). Last year when she started the application process I explained to him that since she lives full time with me, he provides $0 for support, and he isn’t helping with any college costs then I will be claiming her as my dependent in 2022 and from that point forward until I can’t.  He agreed. 

You can probably guess what’s next. 

He recently told me he will be claiming her as his dependent for 2022 “per our agreement”.  I reminded him I was claiming her and I also reminded him that our agreement doesn’t mean shit to the IRS as they go by who our daughter has lived with the most in 2022, and it’s me 100%. She doesn’t qualify as his dependent under IRS rules. 


I am broke. Not his fault, it’s my own for not dragging him to court every time he was in contempt and for declining child support. I took his word that he would support his daughter and co-parent. My bad. There are other issues I won’t get into, taking him to court typically resulted in my daughter being treated poorly from him as a way to get back at me and after 2 years of drama I made the decision to do whatever it took to keep the peace between us for my daughters sake. I’ve always been a hard worker and financially independent. I’ve never asked him for help. 

He earns  $300K a year. This year I will earn $20K. I’ve been sick for 2 years, it’s severely affected my ability to work. I’ve depleted my accounts (they were wiped out in the divorce and I had to start over).  

He cannot deduct tuition costs since he contributed $0 + he doesn’t qualify for the EIC. Both are something I would benefit from. Our daughter is on state medical  (based on my low income) and if he claims her as a dependent they can terminate her. He is aware of this. Her school requires medical insurance.  I cannot afford it.

I eventually worked up the courage to ask for her number and see if we could hang out, and she agreed, to my delight. The first time we hung out, I had her over, made dinner, and I gave her a free tattoo. She admitted soon after that she is struggling and needs help cleaning her apartment. She explained I am the first person that she as asked for help from in a very long time. So of course I agreed to help her, because I had the time, and I think a lot of us have been in situations where we are at a low and just need a hand. For the next few weeks, I would be travelling back and forth from my my place to hers with cleaning supplies, and it seemed to really help her brighten up, but I was usually there for over 6 hours at a time, late into the night helping her with these tasks.

After the few weeks of helping with these clean up jobs at her place, she finally admitted that she was feeling sullen about her upcoming birthday. She was turning 26, and at this age, her mom had her, was establishing a family, a home, etc. She hadn’t accomplished any of that. The upcoming week before her birthday, she was completely silent.

This friend is the type of person who balls up and doesn’t want to be pried, so I decided that instead of reminding her of her birthday, and making a big deal about it, I would get her a gift anyways, but on the day of, I would leave her alone. I bought her a Starbucks cold cup because she loves them and has a collection, I drew some art for her, and I was setting a film night.

The day after her 26th, I sent her a message, and got one word responses or just thumbs up. So I figured immediately that it was because I didn’t do anything for her on the day of her birthday. I sent a text that said, “I was trying to pretend you didn’t have a birthday because I knew you’d be stressed— were you able to curb your anxiety?”, “I still got you a gift to acknowledge that I was proud of you, but I didn’t really think that you waking up to a grand “happy birthday” was gonna make you feel anything other than sad. You clearly explained to me that you like your downtime and hiding in a shell, and your birthday seemed to be a good day to leave you to your devices. I’m really sorry I misunderstood.” The response was, “Terrible ideation but sure”. She followed up by asking when I work next, so she can just pick up the gift I bought her. She also sent an audio message over text, explaining how I ruined her birthday yet again because no one ever does anything fun for her, and her birthday is miserable because she is always alone. She said she hates her life and hates living, and her birthday being spent alone makes it so much worse.

IMO the signs I was being told before were that if she could erase her birthday, she would. I didn’t do it out of malice. After all that, I still apologized though, because I originally felt it was my fault for ruining her b-day.

She’s recently been more busy with a new job, moving back home with family, a new pet, etc. I try to continue our weekly check ins but sometimes our schedules just don’t align. She may be too tired to talk, or sometimes I’ll go to bed extremely early and miss a call from her. Regular life stuff, right? I’m not someone who absolutely needs to hear from their friends 24/7, however, my life has recently changed after my significant other of 5+ years died suddenly. I took the loss extremely hard, especially being in a state away from all family and friends. This friend did reach out and check on me during this time which I am very thankful for. 

I called her earlier this week just to catch up but she was busy. We share locations with each other, so when I noticed her location was off I got a little concerned because that’s not like her to have her location off. I texted her “Problem?” In what I thought was a joking tone even though I was genuinely concerned since I hadn’t heard from her in a while and her location was off. A few hours later she responded saying she was busy and traveling. But she’d call me whenever she has time. After reading her response I felt terrible. I think my tone was misconstrued as trying to “check” her. I immediately apologized and told her that I was sorry and understood how busy she is and only wanted to check in with her, and that the message was more of a joke and my way of making sure she was okay. We usually make shady remarks to each other that aren’t harmful or malicious at all. But her response was that she feels as though I am joking too much with her and our friendship isn’t healthy due to the amount of jokes and she doesn’t have the energy for it. This took me a little off guard. As long as we’ve been friends we’ve always had the joking/ribbing friendship. I haven’t responded because I don’t know what to say. Yes, I do feel bad for making her feel bad. But I’m also confused because if we’ve been friends all these years I feel like she should no I would never intentionally say or do anything to belittle her. My jokes are harmless, or at least I thought so. This friend also apologized to me a few months ago for being an over thinker and possibly letting her insecurities affect the way she receives our conversations at times. 

I called a mutual friend about it who is very close to the both of us and she doesn’t feel that I’m wrong or joking any more or aggressively than I always do.

We have a long standing tradition of getting outside and playing a game of football, rain or shine, before our Thanksgiving meal. About ten years ago we started making it a cash prize deal - we all pitch in (standard is $100 bucks, but more if you feel like it) and then we compete for the pot. We play in two teams, and draw lots for who gets to be team captains each year. Winning team takes the pot and splits it evenly among themselves. So far aside from the minor drunken incident of 2017, all has been fine.

This year, my brother 'Jeff' brought his girlfriend of about 8 months, 'Ally' home to Thanksgiving. We know he's planning on proposing soon, and support it. She's a nice girl, if a little reserved. But I ended up getting put in a tight spot.

I drew the lot to be team captain. That means I get to pick my teammates. Our family has always been fit people, especially my brother, so he was my first pick. I then picked my sister, my dad, and my BIL. There was one spot left open &amp; my brother asked me, within ear shot of Ally, to pick her so they could play on the same team. But, well, the issue is, Ally isn't fit. That's a nice way of putting it. I don't have any real issue with that, but this is a competitive game. I was put on the spot and muttered to him that I couldn't. He seemed confused &amp; asked why not. I muttered in hopes Ally couldn't hear, that I actually wanted to win. It was a $2200 pot - I would get considerably more back then I put in, if we won. And I could use that money.

My brother got PISSED. He whispered to me that I was being a fucking bully &amp; left our team to join my Uncle's, pulling Ally with him. My mom and another cousin ended up taking their places, making our team not as strong, and we ended up losing.

Ally avoided me for the rest of the night even though I tried to make friendly conversation, and my brother came up to me, gave me my 100$ and told me he's probably done playing. 

On one hand, I feel bad. I didn't at all want to hurt Ally. I just wanted our team to win. I wasn't trying to be a bully. And this has never been an issue in our family before.

In my orchestra class I play the violin. We have a concert in ten days and yesterday my teacher asked that I play a new song with about 5 of the other players. I have nothing against the players, it's a small class and we've known eachother for years. It was the piece of music.

He wants me to play a part of the Coventry carol since it's a holiday concert. I told him no, that I did not want to play it. He wanted other players to practice in their sections and I wanted to play with mine. I don't want to sound cocky or anything, but I'm a very decently well violinist. My section partners are basically beginners and I want to take every chance I have to practice with them.

My teacher has had his position for maybe 3 years. My old one was so good with her students, But he has taught nothing. I was talking to my partners and they didn't even know how to hold a bow, and they are playing with advanced players. I really would like to take every chance I can to show them what I know to help them, and over the past few days they've actually improved because I showed them the extreme basics.

I shouldn't have to teach them but I have to. 

I explained to him that I would like to practice songs we already know so we can improve them, but he got pissed. He told me he wasn't going to convince, force, or talk me into it, yet he proceeded to try and do so. He said things like ""You make a difference"" and ""it wouldn't be the same without you.""

There are other capable players, I just wanted to help my group. I tried explaining that but he got mad and made us practice all the way up until our next class.

I understand it's a simple piece, and I know he wants us to have a good set of songs for the concert, but did it have to be me who had to play the part?

Maybe I could've crammed in some time to do so without causing a problem.

An hour before the party he gets a text from this guy that I personally can’t stand, B.

B is 27 and acts like a child. He loves to insult his friends, pull pranks and just in general be a dick. He was once at a bar and stole our friend’s wallet while he was in the bathroom and convinced him that it must have been stolen. He then waited for over an HOUR before he finally admitted that he was the one that took it. Anytime one of our friends achieves something his first response is to insult them. When we bought our house he said to me “Yeah I drove by your new house, what a piece of shit.” Anytime someone calls him out on his behavior he acts like he’s the victim and whines about how it was just a joke. B knows that I don’t like him and he has mostly been ignoring me in group settings.

B texts my bf that he heard we were having a party. My bf asked what I wanted him to say and I decided to grow a backbone. I told him that I was sick of dealing with his shit and I didn’t want to risk him ruining the party. To this my boyfriend said “Okay, but you know he’s going to have a huge bitch fit about this and get all pissed off at us. I don’t like him either babe, but if we don’t invite him it’d be obvious that he was purposely excluded.” To that I said I shouldn’t have to deal with hosting someone I hate at my own house just to keep the peace and this might be a good time to finally have some boundaries. When we lived at our parents’ houses and had hangouts we never invited him and yet he always showed up anyway. I would ask my boyfriend what he was doing here to which he would tell me that it’d be too awkward to tell him to leave. My boyfriend isn’t a pushover, his stance was that he’d rather not make a scene and that it just wasn’t a hill worth dying on. This time my boyfriend actually agreed with me and told him that he couldn’t come.

According to our mutual friend (E, 28M), B has been moaning about how he doesn’t understand why he wasn’t invited and E feels bad for him. I asked E what exactly was my other option, put up with him forever? Be forced to invite him to our wedding? Still be dealing with B after my bf and I have kids? When exactly am I allowed to not invite people I don’t like to my own house? To this E said he understood but he still feels bad that B’s feelings were hurt. If I could trust him to just act like an adult, not call people names and not insult my home of course he’d be invited. Over the 7ish years I’ve known him his behavior has only gotten worse and frankly I’m just too old to deal with it. In fairness to me, there are other people in the friend group that don’t like him much either but it seems like they’d rather just ignore him.

I’ll be honest Reddit I don’t think I’m the AH here but E has made it clear that he doesn’t agree with me so I wanted to hear other perspectives.

He said that he didn’t want to walk all the way there and back or sit through the recital and mentioned how he needed to shower and wash clothes and clean the place up and also wanted to relax. So I mentioned how I didn’t want to walk either and at least we’ll be together and that he didn’t just have to “wait” and that he could watch me perform and that he said he rather go to the concert than watch us practice and again mentioned a Lyft and not wanting to walk there and back or wait, and accused me of guilt tripping him for not wanting to go with me everywhere all the time and that he had no time for himself.

My daughter Eden is 20, almost 21, and my sons are 18 and 16yrs old.

Eden is an incredibly bright girl, I’m so proud of her. She’s in school full time, in the honor society, and she has a 3.8gpa.
She’s about to graduate with her BA a year early, and she plans on going right back to school for either another BA or her Masters.

Starting in June, she ended up in and out of the ER a few times. Her last visit there was in August. She was having some abdominal pain, she could barely keep anything down, and she would faint too. She was exhausted 24/7, and she barely did anything other than sleep and study. The doctors have been running all sorts of tests trying to figure out what was wrong, but everything has come back completely normal.

They ran some more extensive tests a while ago, and today she had an appointment to talk to the doctor about the results. She called me after the appointment and told me that the doctor told her they thought she had functional abdominal pain and she was going to work with them on ways to treat it.
I asked her to explain to me what that was, and what it more or less boils down to is her stressing herself out so bad that her body physically hurts.

Eden has always been a worrier, she panics about everything only for it to turn out just fine in the end, she overthinks all the time. So I told her that if she didn’t like feeling so awful all of the time, she needed to get out of her own head and try not to worry 24/7.

She got upset and told me that it wasn’t just something that was “in her head”, that it’s causing her physical issues and that it’s going to take more than just trying not to worry about things to make it stop.
I said that if being anxious was making her have fainting episodes, bouts of exhaustion, and nausea, then it really was something that was in her head and the way to solve it would be to stop overthinking all the time.

Eden said she didn’t want to talk about it anymore because she wasn’t feeling well and she just wanted to go home and sleep.
She ended up texting me when she got home and saying that she wished I wasn’t so dismissive of her problems, and that me saying that it’s just “in her head” is upsetting to her.
I replied back saying that just because it’s upsetting, doesn’t mean that it’s true. She hasn’t responded since.

Am I being too insensitive with this? I mean the problem really is that she’s stuck in her own head too much.

I (f38) live with my husband (m38) and our two kids (f12 and m10). I have 2 siblings, a brother (m43) and a sister (f45). My brother has been living in France for the past 25 years, he went there for university and met his now-wife (f43), who was born and raised in France, who he has 3 kids with (m14, m13, and f11). We only see him a few times a year. My sister has 2 kids (m13 and m10) with her husband (m45). 

My sister and her husband recently moved to a new house. The house is over a century old and has some issues that need to be repaired before they can move in. My sister and her husband sold their house already, and decided to live with me during this period, which was fine with my husband. My sister already lived in the town, as this is the one we grew up in, it is simply a move to a nicer house a mile or so out, close enough that her kids still go to the same school as before moving. I live about half a mile from my sister's new home.

My sister’s kids have very different personalities, her oldest is the sporty one and plays multiple sports, including lacrosse and American football. He is a very nice kid, has extremely high grades and is talented in many things. My daughter goes to the same middle school as him and says teachers and his peers gush over how nice and amazing he is. His friends are also amazing. 

My sister’s youngest is much more of a challenge, he is pretty nerdy, and only has a few friends, not because he isn’t social (he is very much extroverted) but because he and his friends are bullies. He also has good grades, but he’s a nerdy child and teacher’s pet. My 10 y/o has said some pretty terrifying things about how he acts in school (both are in 5th grade, same elementary school, different teacher).

My kids and her 10 y/o have had some trouble getting along. A few days ago, the 10 y/o’s got into a fight and my nephew decided to grab his brother’s lax stick and swung it around the living room and kitchen, glasses broke. I’m just glad no one was hurt. 

I could handle the previous fighting, but this was too much. My sister and her husband refused to discipline their son. I told them that they had to move out within a few days, and my sister started getting upset at who they could go to. For aforementioned reasons, brother was not an option. Our parents are not an option because they are pretty anti-LGBT, 13 y/o is dating a trans girl. Our parents are not pleased about it and would only start arguments with him, they have before with him and a few of his lax friends/teammate’s over it.

I told her to find a friend or co-worker who she could live with, she found a friend from work but the friend is close to a minimalist and her home, while having room for all of them is not as expensive as my house. My sister has made some classist comments about it being not as nice, despite them making the same income. My sister is begging to let them stay.

She left that message on read and I thought that was the end.

so recently i got back in contact with my family after a few years of getting banned from there gatherings... yes i did take some shit that wasnt mine to take then but i felt bad about it then and am a changed man now... things had been going well for a while and for thanksgiving they told me to pick up grocieries for the dinner before it happened... my mom gave me her credit card and i got everything thatw as on the list and i didnt buy ANYTHING that i wasnt supposed to they can check the logs... but after i got all of the stuff my boy called me i was leaving and asked if i wanted to hang a bit. i went over and we smoked and gamed for a bit but i live in texas and the heat musta cooked all of the food i had in the back and made it bad... it was only like 3 hours and i wasn't even high anymore when i drove home but my parents freaked the fuck out and acted like it wasnt an accident or anything... they then told me they were going to have to buy new grocieries and i wasnt going to get the thanksgiving gift that they usually hand out every year... it was gonna be like 200 dollars and i was expecting that money so i could smoke for the month just to deal with my anxiety.

This is the part that they got really mad about - they had promised me that gift earlier that month and they were really fucking me over saying i couldnt have it anymore, so i went to the spot where they usually hide their cash and i took my 200 from that the day before thanksgiving... i didn't take ANYTHING else even though there was more there. everything was chill for thanksgiving and we had a great time... but now a couple of days ago they freaked the fuck out again and said i had stolen the money from their hiding place and that i was banned from family gatherings again and that they were considering calling the cops just for taking money that i was supposed to fucking get already!!!

For almost the entire duration of our marriage (6 years) he will come into bed while I'm already asleep, usually sometime between 12 AM and 3 AM. There is no marker or guarantee for if he will sleep soundly on any given night, despite his medication. We also have a guest bed and a very comfortable couch which he or I can sleep on separate from our room if we need to. 

Last night he comes into bed at 2 AM. I did say I normally go to bed early, however I made the mistake of drinking an energy drink past 5 PM so I didn't fall asleep until midnight (very rare for me), meaning at this point I'd only gotten 2 hrs of sleep- a fact which he was aware of. I woke up as soon as he came in the room and stayed awake due to the fact that he hiccupped every 5 seconds. I wish that was an exaggeration. I tried my best to ignore it but after 20 minutes I was at my rope's end. I got a little snippy and asked why he'd even come into the room in the first place if he knew he'd be keeping me awake. I even offered to go with him upstairs to help him make up the bed right then (the guest bed had recently had it's sheets washed and we hadn't yet gotten around to making it up. Also we always make it up together since it's pretty tall and against 2 walls. Not to mention he'd probably need help making it anyway since his sleep medicine had kicked in by this point.) 

He did not take me up on the offer or offer any explanation as to why he came to bed with frequent loud hiccups at all. He instead snapped that he'd just go sleep on the couch and immediately left. I stayed in the bed and he stayed on the couch for the rest of the night.

Should I have just left for the couch instead or was I justified in making him leave since he had made the choice to come to bed already hiccupping?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4844382,public,top,self,AITA for kicking my husband out of bed for hiccupping?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9z2dr/aita_for_kicking_my_husband_out_of_bed_for/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I (28 f) have 3 friends involved in this situation. K,P, and A (all 28 f). I have a group chat with K and A, we’ve all been friends since elementary. I recently have been wanting to get out of the group chat because K and A constantly send screenshots of fb posts concerning my friend P and her family. 

This is going to require some background…basically P’s bf of 12 years slept with P’s brother’s wife, this happened 3 years ago and since has been the topic of hot debate and discussion because since then her family has forgiven P’s brothers wife. Even though she continues to cheat.

A sent a picture in the group chat of P’s kids and their cousins waiting for the bus stop in their grandmas car. A followed it up with a text saying “5 kids and 3 sets of parents and none can take their kids to school” so by this point was fed up, this topic has been a constant staple in the group chat for K and A because it’s interesting but for me I don’t care I’m tired of the negativity. I told them I wanted out of the group chat. 

K started being snotty about it and I let her know our friendship is over anyway because she is unsupportive of my loving relationship because she is extremely miserable with her life. 

In order to get out of the group chat you have to add more than 3 people….I figured since they had so much to say…I’d add P to the chat and I left….Everything that happens from here on out is merely a domino effect and was not my doing which is why I’m not sure if I should feel responsible.

Wellllll P gave her a few choice words but P’s mother who is the grandmother went on fb and slandered K and A in a long fb post. She even went so low as to mention K’s son being smacked by a daycare worker a week before (it was all over the news). 

K took it upon herself to message P’s mom but was taunting her calling her a grandma and saying she wants to live vicariously through her daughters life etc. K likes to push buttons and mess with people. 

K texts me and tells me to never talk to her again and blocks me and all platforms which we have never done in 20 years of friendship. It only hurt a little. But I don’t wanna be friends with someone who isn’t happy for me.

He also said he'd get here by the time my class ends, but I have been waiting to hear from him for 2 hours now, and my class ended an hour ago. He is a chronic sleeper, and his phone ringer is always quiet. I've told him to change it because he can barely hear it when it's not on his person or near him. I called him a few times to make sure he was okay, and I got nothing, and this has happened before, so I can safely say that he fell back to sleep. He's also an extremely deep sleeper. I don't have a ride back home and don't feel well waiting in this library, wondering when or if he'll pick me up. Neither of us got much sleep last night or this whole week, so I also feel bad because he needs rest and his schedule is more demanding than mine. I relied on him; he took a nap, woke up from it, texted me, and went back to sleep. I am pissed, but I know he's tired (I am also tired, but I know it was an accident). But he didn't have class today either and took a nap.

She told me that she wanted to have an alcohol-free Thanksgiving because she didn't want people to think they have to drink to have fun hanging out together.  She was met with some backlash from her family about this, but when she insisted that these are her rules or someone else hosts, people relented.  There were a few groans during the day about it, but it wasn't a big issue.  

I'm not a big drinker, but I do enjoy a beer or cocktail like anyone else.  I usually have a pretty well stocked liquor cabinet and some beer in the fridge, but I'm definitely not drinking every day.  My GF usually just drinks wine, but she's been on a health kick lately and has decided to abstain from alcohol completely for a while.  She's been doing this for about 2 months now.

She didn't give me any grief for me drinking until last week.  I had a beer with dinner last Tuesday and she mentioned that since we aren't having alcohol at Thanksgiving, it might be good for me to try and go at least a full week without drinking.  She said that it's important to her for me to prove to myself that I can go at least that long without drinking.

I asked her if she thought I have a problem with alcohol and she said no.  She said she just wants me to be healthy for the long-term because we've been talking about getting engaged.  She said it's important for my health and it shouldn't be that hard to go without it for a short period of time.  So, that's what I did.  Like I said, I'm not a big drinker so it wasn't hard at all to just not drink for a week.  

But last night I had a couple of friends over to watch a basketball game and I offered them a beer and had one myself.  I was getting us a second round when my GF got home from the gym and gave me a nasty look.

After my friends left she called me out and said ""You really just couldn't wait to have a drink could you? You made it exactly a week and were just waiting for that first beer.""  I asked her what her problem was and she said that maybe I do have a problem with drinking if I needed to have a beer right after the week was up.  

I told her that I was just having a couple of beers with friends and I had already gone a week like she asked.  I told her that I feel like she's giving me some kind of BS test and trying to enforce her own desire to not drink on me.  I told her if she wants to test me, then she should give up Starbucks for a week and see how many days after that week is up it takes her to go get one since she's there like every other day.

She said that's different because Starbucks isn't going to kill her like alcohol can.  She said she feels like I was doing the bare minimum when I could have easily just had something else to drink while my friends were over.

For context, I’m 34 and have this very nerdy love for puzzles lol, I always have been. I probably finish 2-3x 1000 piece puzzles every month and typically drop them off at Good Will after. The thrill is really just in satiating my ADHD hyper-fixating so I really don’t care when puzzles are missing pieces (not sure if I’m losing in process or they were missing from the tagsales or thrift stores I got them from.) I recently came up with the idea to take one piece from every puzzle and make a cool picture out of all of them at some point down the line once I’ve accumulated a bunch. Would it be wrong to purposefully make a puzzle incomplete before donating, knowing someone will be paying for it and hoping for a complete picture? Or should I throw it out?

I hate to be wasteful and would love to pass on to another puzzle enthusiast, but like I mentioned earlier, it doesn’t bother me when a puzzle is incomplete so I’m wondering if others would think it’s a d*ck move or if I’m good to go…

The fiancé has 2 teenage sons (14, 17) and my nephew is the only of his siblings still living at home. His dad lives in a different state about 18 hours away.

Nephew has been having a hard time adjusting to the new living situation. He doesn't get along great with his future step-dad's kids. Nephew had been ""running away"" to friends houses and not telling his mom where he is for a couple years now. He also regularly spent a lot of time at my house as he's close with my 15 y/o grandson. He's also likes my home because I'm a lot more lax on things than his mom who can be quite strict. She is a great and loving mom, but from her son's view she can be a little overbearing. 

About 4 weeks ago he got into an argument with one of the fiancé's sons that turned into a physical fight, they both got in trouble (as they should) but nephew claims the son had been essentially bullying him for a year at this point (not the words he used but a summary of the behaviour he described). This had worsened since they all moved in together and nephew has been increasingly unhappy at home even when the other boys were at their moms. The day after this fight, he ran away to his older half-sisters (dad's side) home 2 hours away. He refused to come home for several days and missed school. Mom was very upset. I went to my nieces with my grandson to convince him to go home but he refused. I was however able to convince him to at least come back to town and stay at my house so he didn't miss anymore school. 

I have 3 kids still living at home (17, 11, 8) in a 4 bed house and keep a room spare for my older kids. I gave him this room and he's been staying with me for a little over 3 weeks. He's back in school, and doing everything he normally would but still refuses to go home. His mom is pissed with me because i'm letting him stay with me but his dad is happy he has the option. Brother was in town for the weekend and we all (me, brother, mom, her partner) got together and talked in person. His mom got very upset (which i understand) but then said that I'm ruining her family and her future marriage by not kicking her son out so he would go home. I suggested she and her partner need to figure out a game plan to make all their kids get along better and make everyone comfortable in their new home, she just thinks I'm butting in when i have no right. I personally want to see my nephew move back home before Christmas and don't think this should be a permanent situation, even if I'm happy to keep him until he's ready to go home.

I'm torn here. On one hand I want my nephew to be in a safe space where he can be comfortable, on the other hand, as a mother myself I would be equally distraught if my child wanted to stay with someone else over me. There is no safeguarding issue here, his home is essentially fine, he's just unhappy there.

Until a month ago, this was fine. They never paid me or offered me gas money, but at least they were appreciative and paid for the animal feed. They bought me lunch a few times, but I really didn't mind because I got my animal fix. Then I got my new job. Until yesterday (when this all boiled over), I did not have access to the building. I had to wait for my supervisor to get into work at 8:15 - 8:30 so she could buzz me in. Per regulations, it had to be my supervisor who let me in (or the head security officer, who gets in around 9). Security also doesn't like you to hang around in the lobby.

This did not go over well. They pushed back and told me they would ""deal with it"". Well, their method of ""dealing with it"" so far has been doing nothing. I am expected to feed their animals for them and I have been berated because I don't come by in the morning to feed. I have told them several times that I will simply not be able to do this next semester, as I am in graduate school and I won't be able to make a two+ hour round trip to do a job that is actually supposed to be the 15 y/o's.

Yesterday, I found myself racing to their house before the sun set and it was too dark for the livestock to eat. By the time I got there, it was very cold and dark. I wound up completing the chores by lantern light before texting my parents that if they wanted me to keep doing this, they needed to pay me. (I have an animal/house sitting business on the side.  Normally $100 a week, I would have charged them gas money.) I also offered a compromise - 15 y/o does the easy ones in the morning instead of watching TV, I do the PITA ones after work.

We had a row over the cellphone, where I said that I an tired of structuring my life around a 15 y/o's chores, that I felt like I was being taken advantage of, and it wasn't fair to me, the animals (having to wait in the cold all day), or the 15 y/o (the job was supposed to teach her responsibility).

I was told that I was, being a jackass and hurting my little sister by yelling at people in front of her. I asked my sister what she thought. She ignored me until I flat out asked her if she was listening. She replied that yes, she was, but it was so stupid that she didn't think it deserved a response at all.

I told them that I quit, which led to another row.

This morning, I've been kicked from the family group text and the middle sibling has ignored me when I texted her a question. My parents have left me two very guilt trippy messages on my voice mail.

They're very low maintenance and she had to check in on them once a day and freshen up their water - they have one of those automatic pet feeders - so she didn't need to prepare food or anything. This is not the first time she has watched them. 

I usually leave her a bottle of wine and some sort of giftcard as a thank you whenever she watches them.

Well, shortly after I got back from vacation she came by and told me she's gonna go on vacation for a few days as well and if I'd be able to watch her dog, take him on walks etc.

I told her that while I would love to help, unfortunately I can't look after her dog since it doesn't really fit in my time schedule and I probably wouldn't have the time to take him on his 3 walks a day and spend enough time with him. And to maybe ask the old couple next door since I know they love dogs and would probably have the time to do the dog justice while she's gone.

She didn't really say anything other than okay thanks and left. She apparently did ask the couple next door since I've seen them take the dog out while she was gone.

I kinda thought that was it but ever since she went on vacation she was giving me weird looks and kind of ignored me, so a few days ago when I ran into her at the mailboxes I asked her if I did anything wrong and if she'd like to talk about anything.

She pretty much told me that she thinks it's a dick move to let her watch my cats and then decline when she needs someone to watch her pet. And that I work from home anyways so I would have plenty of time to take her dog on walks and play with him and so on.

I told her that I'm very sorry she's upset and that I feel like watching a dog for a few days and giving my cats some water everyday are two very different things and that I just can't fit a dog into my busy schedule right now - even if I work from home I don't have regular lunchbreaks and stuff like that. And that I'm happy to help her out whenever - just not with taking care of her dog.

She said she doesn't care and that she won't be watching my cats in the future since I'm not being a good neighbor.

I told her I'm sorry and tried to explain again and she just walked away. I have seen her one since and she didn't even look in my direction.

I'm a bit confused here. To be honest - I don't really think I'm an asshole since I feel like watching cats vs watching a dog are two very different things. But maybe I'm missing something here. Am I really the asshole?

So AITA?
