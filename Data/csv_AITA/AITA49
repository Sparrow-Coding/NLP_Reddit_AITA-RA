Hi everyone,

I'm at a loss and need some advice. Last week, my husband and I renewed our vows on our 10th anniversary. I was so touched by the beautiful words he spoke and the depth of his love for me. But now I found out that he actually used the OpenAI chatbot to write his vows.

I don't know how to feel. On one hand, I'm flattered that he wanted to put so much effort into expressing his love for me. But on the other hand, I feel hurt and betrayed that he didn't write the vows himself. I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but I also don't want to pretend like everything is okay.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? I just want to understand my husband's perspective and find a way to move forward.

Growing up, I lived with my mom, brothers, my aunt, uncle, and five cousins who are basically siblings. I left for the army in 2019 and my mom decided to move back to her home town with my brothers, about ten hours away to Oregon. So the family I grew up with has been split in half since I left for the army. I only go home once a year for Christmas, fly into California and halfway through leave make the drive to Oregon to spend time with the other half. This is difficult for me but I'm willing to do it to make everyone's lives easier and see everyone. But my family doesn't make any effort. It starts with my mom offering to pay for half my plane ticket to convince me to come, then backing out last minute. My aunt, who I fought with a lot as a teen admittedly, said some very hurtful things about me coming home saying I'm unpleasant to be around. When I'm home I'm always put on the couch despite there being spare beds available. Stuff that I couldnt bring with me to the army, I asked my mom to take care of and she agreed but it all got ""lost in the move"" despite everyone else's things being accounted for. I try to plan fun things for everyone to do but am shot down for preexisting plans that I'm not invited to be part of. Then the argument about when my flight lands, who will pick me up, etc. I don't think it's too much to ask for ONE of my five family members with cars/able to drive to come thirty minutes to the airport but it's ALWAYS a struggle to get one to agree. This year I booked my flight, keeping in mind my aunt and brothers work schedule to land at a good time despite the higher ticket price, and after booking, let them know two months in advance when I plan on getting there. They said they were fine with this but told my mom afterwards, she berated me calling me entitled for not discussing it with them first to schedule. I tried to explain that my unit only offers certain leave days so my options are limited. Our argument escalated to me basically letting out my frustration about never feeling welcome back home. I originally wasn't going at all this year but my mom said she would spend the week in California so I wouldn't have to go back and forth, but now she's back tracking saying my brothers have basketball practice in Oregon that they can't miss. I told her that I honestly didn't equate two of my brothers basketball practices with the thousands I spend on tickets not to mention limited leave days and difficulty getting leave approved. She hasn't answered my texts since. My feelings are really hurt by this but I realize I'm not the center of my family's lives, they shouldn't have to drop everything for my visits, I just wish they'd make some effort.

I share an apartment with 3 other women. We are all on separate leases, and we each get our individual bedrooms and bathrooms while we share a kitchen, laundry room, and living room. 

Since my boyfriend is long distance (a 6 hour flight away, actually) we knew he would have to spend a few nights if he ever visited. We were planning on him visiting me in less than a week.

Shortly after we moved in, my roommates and I sat down and wrote a roommate agreement, and we said we would be ok with men spending the night as long as they were not hookups or strangers.

I texted my apartment's group chat a few weeks ago to let them know my boyfriend would be over for a few days, let them know the dates, and I also gave them plenty of time to object (the trip was a month out at the time)

Today, they got back to me and said they were uncomfortable with him spending the night, but we have already bought the ticket and it isn't refundable. We got into a huge argument where they told me to get a hotel, but I can't afford a hotel because I am a full time student and I also work full time.

My parents are a bit toxic sometimes, especially my mom. But they do love us and the relationship is okay. My sister and I sometimes bond over our complicated relationship with them. My sister has ADHD and she is a bit unusual, very logical, sometimes socially awkward, but also sensitive. She's vegan and doesn't drink. People often don't get her and I can see why, but she's a good person and can be fun to be around.

Now, my sister broke up with her husband recently. They were together for 18 years so she's emotionally fragile and says she doesn't really want to spend Xmas with our parents, at leats not all of it. I said I would talk to my husband and see if we could invite her over for maybe the 23rd and 24th until lunchtime, after which we would go to my inlaws and spend the rest of Xmas with them. 

I explained all this to my husband and emphasized that she's my sister, she's in a bad place emotionally and it would be kind to invite her. He got kinda annoyed and said that the way I phrased it basically gave him no choice and he would like like AH if he said no. We had a bit of a fight about it and I said it's unfair since we spend so much time with his family (which I don't mind, they're awesome) but when I ask him to help out my sister who is in a difficult situation he gets annoyed. It's not even that he would refuse, but I don't want him grumpy all Christmas. Also, he's not really mad about the invitation, but he's feeling pressured into agreeing to inviting her over.

AITA? I am 17(f) and am currently in high school. I share a room with 2 younger siblings, 11(f) and 5(m).

I never really had a good relationship with my father to begin with. We have a long history or him physically and mentally abusing me but writing it off as “discipline”. However recently, things are taking a turn for the worst. 

Everyday my father makes it a point to yell and curse at me, telling me to do chores and how useless I am. I’ll admit it’s hard for me to keep up with chores. This because I am often the only one in my household (of 6) that does chores. My younger siblings are constantly making messes, and to top it off, after coming home from work, my dad often leaves dishes in the clean kitchen for me to also clean. I also have to clean the common spaces, bathroom, and floors everyday. Chores easily take at least 90 minutes daily. 

One of the points my father always makes in his rants towards me is that I am lazy and sorry. He says this because he typically works 12 hours days. He seems to be under the impression that I do nothing, because it doesn’t contribute to the household bills. It’s also important to mention that I normally wake at 7am and usually sleeps by at least by 2am. I am full time in school and part time online, which totals to be 11 courses. I also participate in leadership clubs with board positions (4). Because of this often times, I have meetings during, before, and after school. With these obligations, I have many projects and tasks per week, some small and some bigger taking up to 6 hours in a single day. On top of all of this, I maintain a 3.8 unweighted gpa, bringing home mostly A’s. It is also college application and scholarships season, to which I am doing entirely on my own. The point is, I am definitely not lazy or sorry, but productive, hardworking, and rather busy. 

When my father gets home, he never even greets me or asks me about my day. Instead he instantly yells at me about messes and chores. Even the dishes he leaves in the kitchen, as if he never put them there. If I take a nap on one of the days that I actually make it home by 5:30 or am sleep before 12am, he’s sure to wake me for more little miscellaneous tasks and chores that could easily be done by anyone, such as taking out the trash or mopping a spilled mess.

One night  at 12 am I was asleep. He woke me to ask about Amazon packages and more cleaning and chores. This time, I without words, expressed my anger clearly, but cleaned without objection. My father seeing that I was irritated stopped to lecture me. There is nothing I can say or do at this point to satisfy him, so I just listened to his lecture like I always do. Out of frustration and exhaustion I began crying, to which he became even more angry at. At this point he’s full on berating me, calling me every derogatory name there is.

I am currently writing this in my bed at 1:30am. All I can think is that I genuinely hate my father.

As the years passed, we drifted apart (as many high school friends do.)
In 2010, she reached out to me asking if I had any guy friends that I could introduce her to and immediately Derek came to mind. They were both single and vegetarian, so I thought they might hit it off. Sure enough, they did, and have been dating ever since.

I intended for her to bring her husband and her cousin with us but they were unable to go so I invited Stacy and Amanda to come with us, as their birthdays were both around that time frame. I thought it would be fun because we had gone together all those years ago and it could be an epic girls night. We were so excited when we got there, taking selfies before the show, and then as soon as the music started Stacy and Amanda ditched us!! Not gonna lie, I was pretty hurt. I didn’t make them pay for the tickets, they were a gift, but I assumed we would stick together! I still had a great time with Beth but was so disappointed that Stacy and Amanda disappeared on me. After the concert they found us again, but only because I was Amanda’s ride home. It’s been 4 years but I’m still really upset about it and haven’t talked much to either of them. 
Now fast forward to this year. Derek and Stacy just got engaged. Stacy sent me a text a few weeks after it happened. I told her I was happy for them. She acknowledged that she was happy I introduced them. I just got a save the date in the mail today. I’m friends with BOTH Derek and Stacy but I’m considering not attending their wedding just because I feel like we’re not really friends anymore. She is only inviting me because I introduced them.

A lot of times, he ends up making me feel guilty and I don’t get to really recharge. 

He’s usually up around 5 am. There’s no reason for me to be up that early since our child doesn’t get up until 7-7:30 each day. 

He says it’s disrespectful to him and that I shouldn’t need as much me-time as I do. I just want time to collect my thoughts in peace. Plus, I make sure to be quiet and take care of my bedtime routine when he goes to bed so I don’t disturb him.

 My family and some other close friends, decided to give a helping hand to my sister to rush the renovations in recently bought apartment on my floor. Hiring a construction company is way to costly here and almost no one does if they can do it alone. 


Since almost everyonefinishes work after mid day or 15pm we decided that we will work in the apartment after 15pm in order to not disturb the neighbors and respect the law. 
Decided to rush the plumbing ( kitchen and two toilets) which is what will make most noise so that mid December we would already be finished with it.

Since my sister lives far away and isn't here every day, hearing the complaints turned out to be my main responsibility.

Sure, I understand that hearing the construction noises is annoying. But the first neighbors that complained came in the first three hours of it. The same neighbors that last year did  renovations for half a year from 8am until 18/19pm. With almost no pause and respect for the down time from 13pm to 15pm. 


Fast forward two weeks came in the second neighbors.  I Understand that they have a little baby of seven months. And I really am sorry for having to make noise :( 


Another one decided to give us his work schedule where he wrote the days we can and cannot work (the days he has the nightshift).


 But let's be honest...what are  2 or 3 hours of noise? Sure you can say that since it's their away time from work they wouldn't want to hear renovations sounds... Right.


 The neighbors that  came have Hause wifes that don't work and only raise the kids. The kids and the wifes are at home all day. So let's face it that they would complain anyway.  And God forbid we decide to make noise all day like they did.

I know I am being a A in a way but at same time there is no other way around it when doing renovations. In a apartment you hear kids, loud music, loud tvs and even louder scandals from everyone. Especially renovations sounds. I never complain because I get that I don't live ""alone"". If I wanted to be away from the noise I would not buy a apartment but a house.  But everyone have their own work schedule they want us to respect, their kids that need ""time away from noise"" and their wifes that have sensitive hearing.

So on Thursday i was picking my nephew from school (starts at 8am and home time is at 1pm) and i start to see a lot of people gathered around the gate and i walk there to see what was up and i see two enraged boys around 15-&gt;16yo's cussing at each other and their families. I stayed there for 2 minutes then i went to pick up my nephew and when I came back the one of the boys (let's call him Terrence) had pinned down the other (let's call him Andy) and kicked his family jewels. I had the idea of separating them but i thought it'd be dangerous bcz they are really tall and could potentially hurt me. Then Andy grabs Terrence's fingers and he bites them untill they have huge marks and bleed a little after this I left so i wouldn't traumatize my nephew who thank God couldn't see anything.

But as I was leaving the school premises i encounter 'karen' which was apparently Terrence's mom and she asked why I didn't separate them and i just said I didn't want to and there were plenty of adults watching and a teacher walked by and did nothing (i think she didn't see bcz she's short) and she snaps, telling me I'm stupid, a c**t, an a hole and I should be happy her precious baby will have to be in the hospital bcz incompetent adults like you enjoy watching kids hurt themselves and she even tried to slap me but the guard was there and escorted her out from the school and i left too and took nephew to lunch and the the park.

Throwaway account. 

I adopted a kitty a few weeks ago, she has been here officially since last saturday. She is 5 months old and is partially paralyzed in her back legs. She is also incontinent, meaning she has to wear a diaper. 

I found her on an adoption site while I was scrolling out of boredom. I cried big man tears as soon as I saw her little face on there. I just felt so bad for her and she looked like the sweetest, most innocent thing. Don't get me wrong, she is the cutest and she is absolutely beautiful. I had to adopt her, I felt the urge to ""save"" her and to give her the life she deserves, because I know that cats like her would be put down after a while if no one adopted them. 

But I regret adopting her. 

I already started to regret it after the first day she got here. I knew it was going to be time consuming and expensive to take care of a paralyzed cat, I knew that. I have no problem taking care of her, the diaper change has already become routine. 

What I didn't think about it the fact that she needs attention literally 24/7. That means no more going away for vacation, no more day trips, no more freedom to do what we want to do. Maybe for the next 15 years. I'm currently jobless and have been jobless for the past 5 years. What if I get a job? Who is going to take care of her? My gf is working, and we can't afford a cat sitter. Who's going to take care of her if we go on vacation? Nobody will be willing to take care of a cat who needs her diaper changed every few hours. 

I'm lost. I feel selfish. I feel like the only logical option is to give her back. But I can't. It hurts every time I look at her. The love she shows us...She obviously feels so good here and I love her so much, but I don't think I can do this for 15 years. I don't know what to do. I'm honestly lost. My girlfriend knows about my feeling, but not to the full extent. It would break her heart.

At first. The second train was only 45 minutes long. However, seating was open and we were not notified. Thankfully, disabled seating was still open and available which left plenty of room for my service dog to settle comfortably at my feet. I'm not sure why, but this set off the passenger across the aisle.
I call her Karen. Karen decided to make very rude and nasty comments about my SD and I such as we were ""wasting space"" and saying she didn't want to sit next to ""that thing"" and be next to ""it"" for an entire train ride. I'm assuming she was going all the way to the end, but we were only 3 stops away so we had a short trip ahead. Or so we thought. Longest 45 minutes of my life. Even with ear buds in on her side, I could hear her nasty remarks about my dog. He was laying down at my feet totally silent. Being the absolute best boy. Nowhere near her. Never approached her or anything.
I kept my cool until she began intimidating my dog. She made direct, aggressive eye contact with him to the point he became nervous and hid his head under my seat. Everyone who knows him knows he's a very sound SD and does not get scared easily. Especially by other people. To say I was furious is understating it. I actually had to pointedly face toward her and stare into her soul for what felt like 10 minutes before she got uncomfortable and left him alone. He hid his head the entire rest of the ride.
Worst part is she was close enough that when she purposely angled her phone screen to make it visible I saw her typing up something in the complaint form on Amtrak. I knew she was probably saying something awful, and I had to act fast. I took a subtle video panning the train car from her side to mine, making sure to capture her face and belongings in it. Then, when we detrained, I snapped a picture of her train car number. I reported her to staff at the train door, and they completely brushed it off and said to call customer service. 
I feel like an asshole for taking her picture, but I needed a way to identify her if things escalated.

It’s a pretty realistic looking tree and it’s really nice. 

Last year after Christmas, we stored it at my in laws. They have a shed in their backyard. Pretty recently, my FIL told us that there is black widows in there. Me being afraid of spiders, was scared that potentially there would be spiders in our tree. It was in a zipped up cover, but I’m an over thinker and was scared anyways. I don’t want spiders in my place. 

Earlier this week, I was talking to my manager and told her about that in a casual conversation. The next day she asked me if I’d be okay if we use my tree in our office and I can use the old tree for my place.  she said because if there was spiders, we’d see them there in our office. I was fine with that. Even though I already know the office tree is not as nice, I was okay with it. 

So yesterday I went with my manager to my in laws to get my tree. And I brought the old office tree home. 

Tonight, I set up the tree and only the bottom portion of the lights work (there’s three parts.) I’m kinda sad abt it :( and I don’t wanna spend money on a whole new tree or new lights knowing I had a perfectly fine one. 

I kinda wanna ask her if I can take my tree and they can have theirs and get lights for it. If I would’ve known it didn’t light up all the way I wouldn’t have said they could borrow mine.

I tend to be on edge because of this but people say I am a more empathetic and affectionate person.

My bff, who I've known since we were toddlers, has mild autism and his mother is boarding on verbally abusive. Because of this he isn't open about his feelings and struggles to show his care for others, but he's always managed for me. We've always been there for each other to help out and support and it's never been a problem. 

At the start of this year, his home got worse. His mother was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and her abusive ways increased. Throughout the year, I did my best to do whatever I could for my friend; he slept over as much as possible, I did fun activities with him to distract him and give him ways to cope, I contacted other family members of his to try and get him out of the situation, and when I was really worried about his mental state I reached out to his therapist to keep him safe. 

Understandably, his mood has changed dramatically from what I knew. He got cold and angry and often snapped and swore at me, which I let slide because I knew he was hurting. At the same time I held back on telling him the issues that were starting to bubble up in my own life, as I didn't want to strain him. Not to mention that the few times I tried, he shouted at me, got angry at me for having these feelings and made them about him.

About two months ago, he was finally taken away from his abusive mother and put in a nurturing environment. I was so happy when I saw the improvement of his mental health and how he was acting more like the real him. I still didn't tell him things that were going on though, as I didn't want to bother. I waited until I was sure he was settled before I asked him if I could talk to him about some things that were going on in my life, as things got worse and I needed support from my BFF. He said he wasn't ready yet, so I dropped the subject.

Then a week ago, a crisis occurred in my life that has had a negative impact on my health. I needed to talk to him, so I tried. I figured this was an emergency situation and surely he could at least pretend to care right? The response I got was him being angry at me for trying to share the event, him getting annoyed that I was so ""whiney"" and ""dramatic"" and that I was making things worse.

For context, I am 26f and make on commission anywhere between $20-40/hr, my husband is 27m and makes 15/hr hourly, and our roommate Steve makes $18~ish an hour as far as I know. 

Steve is……. For lack of a better word, a baby. He was raised by, and until recently lived with, his “mumma.” He told us prior to moving in together that several “a**hole roomies kicked him out along with his ex. We believed his side of things but I’m 10 mo in to living w this guy and have slowly over time begun to hate him. 

I deep clean the kitchen once every two weeks. My hubs does it every other week. Steve will ignore the mess of the kitchen - whether he contributed to the mess or not - until one of us cleans it for him. He once made “chili”. - aka he found a recipe he “wanted to make” but “all ur has is ingredients not measurements!!” aka he found one of those cooking blogs and didn’t scroll to the bottom to read how to actually cook it/what MEASUREMENTS it required. He just “boiled” everything. It was gross and he left the pots on the stove for a MONTH. 

If I cooked for the “family” aka him, my at the time fiancé “Rick”, and myself, our rule was ‘whoever cooks is the last to clean’ aka the cook hand washes whatever didn’t fit in the dishwasher. 

Steve would and still does just disappear after a “family meal” - but not before he uses MY Tupperware to secure his lunch at least for the next day. 

He also pays 1/3 of the rent. Say it’s $2k/mo. His responsibility is $667/mo in rent. But our house is 3b 2bath. He has TWO bed to himself. 

Recently, we had a “Friendsgiving.” Or was his idea and he expected 6+ of his friends to show. None did. However, my MIL and BIL qnd 4 of our friends came. I spend 450+ on making this dinner and buying wine.  Steve did. N O T H I N G. I mean nothing. 

He stole HALF the leftovers that I COOKED myself. He made and provided zero. 

I want to boot him for this and MANY other reasons that I don’t have room to type.

She's developed this habit of, when we aren't paying attention, swiping 3 or 4 cookies and going to her room.

A few days ago, when neither one of us was paying attention, she swiped 4, took them to her room. I happened to see her munching away in her room when I walked past her room in the hallway. I asked what she was doing. She said nothing. I asked who those cookies were for. She said she didn't know. I asked if she'd tiptoed to the kitchen, grabbed them, and brought them to her room. She said no. I asked if she was sure about that. She said she didn't remember. When I told her I'd need to go get mom to help us solve this mystery, then she suddenly recalled that yes she'd taken the cookies. 

As I started thinking about what to do from there, she grabs me, starts apologizing profusely, hugging me, telling me she loves me. Gave me this sad little look with her big blue eyes and I just couldn't do it, so, I let her off with a "" Don't do it again"".

When I told my girlfriend what'd happened, she told me I can't afford to be so lax with her and let her off easy just because she gives me a puppy dog look. She was livid that she wasn't told about this incident at the time and thinks I'm teaching our daughter that Dad will let her get away with things.

It was a mutt, don't know if it even has a breed of its own. We knew it was lost as it had a collar and it looked like it was well taken care off. It didn't look like it came from the streets. His dad wanted to get rid of it but I advocated to keep it. We tried looking for the owner through Facebook, checking pet groups, asking around but we just couldn't find the owner. We don't have those tracking chips in my country BTW. 

My stepson had trouble making friends as he moved here with his dad from another country. He barely spoke our langauge and he had foreign features that made him stand out. Atleast with a dog it would keep him company.

I think it did him good as the two bonded especially  later when my husband was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer and eventually passed on. My country doesn't have emotional support pets but I think that's what that dog was for him. It was more than a pet...

Anyway he moved back to his country to go to college and I kept the dog. The reason he didn't bring the dog is 1 his dorm doesn't allow dogs and even if he decides to rent a place (which would be expensive) 2 he wouldn't have time to take care of a dog due to studies, if he decides to get a part-time job, make friends or be in a relationship and 3 the price to ship the dog, get the necessary documents, vaccinate it would be equivalent to a downpayment of a house here, financially it doesn't make sense.

 So I personally owned/had this dog for three years. I know some of you will judge me but I like this dog but I don't necessarily love him the way Mike loves him.

While  Dusty (dog) and I were on a walk he started going crazy and pulling me till he saw  this guy. If you ever watched those heartwarming YouTube videos where the dog was crying and jumping around that's what the dog did so I knew it was Dusty's original owner. We got to talking, he explained how he lost his dog, how they looked for him and I explained who I am and who the dog was to to Mike. He was a friendly guy and told me nicely he wanted the dog back. I obviously told him    my stepson owned the dog and I needed to talk to him first. We exchanged info and later that night I contacted Mike obviously he didn't want to return the dog as he has about another year or so of College and he's planning to go back here and so I followed his wishes.

It was very bad and came as a shock.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner believes in reincarnation. And wanted a kitten that was born within a certain time range, not the point of the issue but info that's needed.

So I did the research, it took me weeks but I finally found four litters within a decent area that fit the timeline.

I showed him all the pictures and info and waited for him to tell me if he was interested. He brought it up a week later and wanted more info on certain kittens, and then asks to go see them.

I set up the time to meet the kittens.

We go see the kittens, I drove both ways 1.5 hours each way, I have horrible driving anxiety. The owner was very sweet and genuine. There was a mix up with the gender of the older kitten, we had wanted a boy, but being so small I can understand why you might make that mistake.

When my partner tried to interact with them, they meowed and fussed as I would expect them to. He was looking to make a connection, and we weren't aware that they would be this little, so not much connection could be made. For me that didn't matter, even though I panicked every 15 mins of the drive I was so so happy to see them, these little wonderful creatures.

My partner just kept saying I can't make a connection with them, they are just too little and so on. So the owner said they would be happy to have us come back in three weeks and they would not promise either of the boys to anyone else until we had time to see them again. I thought that was very nice.

Once we got back into the car he began acting all moody. I said it's ok we will come back I don't mind driving and it barely cost any gas. He grumbles it's not about the gas and that the entire trip was a waste, he had to take anxiety med to make the trip and now if we wanted the kitten we would have to make at least two more trips.

We got home and he just started going off on how the older boy kitten must have been sold (they are not ready to go home yet just fyi), and the owner was trying to get us to take the girl kitten. I said I didn't think so and they were so small it was understandable, trying to soothe the situation. He didn't like that and shut me down saying I wasn't hearing his side of things and that I was arguing.

So he continued with the you've done nothing to comfort me and so on, though I had tried my best to soothe. He was being demanding and cutting me down for not being supportive. So I asked, what's really important here?!? He says ""My Feelings!"" I said if that's what's really important here we aren't getting the cat! So AITA?

This is a situation that I hope that everyone involved, particularly my stepbrother and I, can resolve.

I (27f) have a bond with my stepbrother “Mike” (28m) and his fiancée “Lily” (27f). My dad married his mom when we were in high school. We weren’t that close initially but when I got to know Mike, he started to feel more like a real brother.

In college, my friend, Lily, started dating Mike. Lily has been Mike’s only girlfriend. He’s always been a quiet guy and had insecurities around dating. He asked me for a lot of dating advice early in their relationship, which I happily gave him. Neither treated me like a third wheel and were always down to hang out and have fun. While I’ve been single, both were invested in hearing about any of my first dates and gave me emotional support when I felt lonely. When Mike proposed and Lily asked me to be her maid of honor this summer, I was ecstatic. 

Mike and Lily threw an engagement party. There, I talked to Lily’s coworker, “Jesse” (27m). I usually saw him in passing, but we had a nice conversation. Jesse asked for my number. He wasn’t my usual type, but I thought he was cute. Our first date went so well, we went out again the next day. Afterwards, I was excited to tell Lily about it. When I did, she acted confused at first, then questioned if Jesse had fetishized me.

To clarify, I’m Black and Jesse’s White. Mike is also Black and Lily is White. This was the first time I dated outside my race, assumed Lily was being protective, and maybe knew something bad about Jesse. But she denied knowing anything bad about him, saying it was intuition.

Mike later texted that he was concerned Jesse was using me as an experiment. I asked why he thought that and he replied with the same “intuition” answer.

I invited them on a double date with me and Jesse so they could get more of a read on him. Weird, I know, but in the past, they’ve looked out for me, and I trusted them.

But Lily kept making snide comments and Mike was short in conversation the whole dinner. I was mortified and could tell Jesse was put off by their behavior. Afterwards, I texted both of them, asking if everything was ok. Neither responded for a couple days. Then, I texted again to ask if I could come over to talk. Mike responded and agreed. When I went over, they were both still acting weird.

Gently, I asked Mike what he thought about the date. He said I was being naive and “guys like Jesse usually want a Scarlett Johansson-type.” Lily was quiet but nodded a couple times. It was out of character for them.

I lost my temper, saying, “Lily’s the only girlfriend you’ve ever had. Why are you acting like some dating expert?”

Mike said not to come crying when Jesse “used” me. I stormed out of there. 

I told my dad about it. He says Mike was giving his honest opinion and that I should apologize to move past it.

I was desperated so I created a gofundme to raise some money and people also sent money directly to my bank account.

My father sent me money some weeks after the argument so I gave the donors all the gofundme money back (but not the money sent directly to my bank account because I used it to pay for my bills as soon as I received it).

I wrote a text online thanking people for their help and that I was giving them the gofundme money back because I didn't need it anymore and thought it would be unfair to spend it when I wasn't really needing it.

My financial life got better and I traveled abroad some months after that.

Throwaway account.

I'll try to keep it short. 

I adopted a kitty a few weeks back and she has been with us (gf and I) for a week now. 
She is 5 months old and is partially paralyzed in her back legs. She is also incontinent, meaning she has to wear a diaper.

I found her on an adoption site while I was scrolling out of boredom. I cried big man tears as soon as I saw her little face on there. I just felt so bad for her and she looked like the sweetest, most innocent thing. Don't get me wrong, she is the cutest and she is absolutely beautiful. I had to adopt her, I felt the urge to ""save"" her and to give her the life she deserves, because I know that cats like her would be put down after a while if no one adopted them.

But I regret adopting her.

I already started to regret it after the first day she got here. I knew it was going to be very time consuming to take care of a paralyzed cat, I knew that. I have no problem taking care of her, the diaper change has already become routine.

What I didn't think about it the fact that she needs attention literally 24/7. That means no more going away for vacation, no more day trips, no more freedom to do what we want to do. Maybe for the next 15 years. I'm currently jobless and have been jobless for the past 5 years. What if I get a job? Who is going to take care of her? My gf is working, and we can't afford a cat sitter. Who's going to take care of her if we go on vacation? Nobody will be willing to take care of a cat who needs her diaper changed every few hours.

I'm lost. I know that the only logical option is to give her back. But I can't. It hurts every time I look at her. The love she shows us...She obviously feels so good here and I love her so much, but I don't think I can do this for 15 years. I don't know what to do. I'm honestly lost. My girlfriend knows about my feeling, but not to the full extent. It would break her heart.

I fucked up. I have to face the consequences. She deserves better than this.

Am I the asshole for considering giving her back?

She’s a bit timid but is all around kind, respectful, responsible, intelligent, and beautiful. I also have a friend (M/23) who I introduced her to.

Some background: We would all hang out and have fun but they started to develop a friendship. They got along really well and I felt like she was starting to like him. I know they text frequently and I’ve asked about it and she says she finds it easy to go to him because they relate with mental health issues and some trauma. I admit, I have no experience with either, but it hurts knowing she goes to him for some stuff and not me. 

Where the issue begins is one night she told me that they watched a movie together (over a call, not at a theater). This really upset me because I felt like it just proved she liked him more, especially because neither one invited me. We texted our good nights and I made the decision to distance myself from her and him, so I ignored her for a week and cut him off until I decided to talk to her because I missed her and started to feel bad. 

When I heard back from her, she was not happy and didn’t understand what she had done. I explained to her what happened and why I had ignored her and she was upset because she felt like it was hurtful. In response, I told her she could’ve just kept texting me until I responded and she got mad saying she won’t partake in mind games and won’t be chasing after anyone. She also told me it was childish of me to overreact and expect her to know what was wrong and to get mad at something as innocent as two friends watching a movie. She also told me I was out with friends so they didn’t invite me (I was at a bar). 

I told my sister about what happened and she told me I was an idiot and a jerk because it’s clear that they’re just friends and I showed this girl how insecure I was by getting jealous so easily. She also told me that if she were in this girls shoes, her perspective of me would’ve changed because of how quick I came to conclusions and changed my behavior and attitude towards her so easily.

We were living with his parents at the time with our two cats in a single bedroom in the basement. After finding out I’m pregnant we decided to move into my parents home because it’s cleaner, more quiet, and lots of room for the baby. The issue was my mom is allergic to cats so we wouldn’t be able to bring them with us for the move. I decided to sell my cat since I wasn’t overly attached. I didn’t have him for long. My boyfriend is very attached to his and his parents refused to let him keep his cat at their house for the time being til we got our own place. His sister (22F) owns five cats so he decided to message her asking if she’s okay with taking his cat in for a bit. 

She immediately got angry saying my family was selfish for not allowing him to bring his cat, since their family let me have mine at their home. She then proceeded to attack me saying I’m lazy, irresponsible, using him, and that I am going to abandon him with our baby. 
**I have never even spoken more than two words to this woman in my life 

My bf got upset and wouldn’t speak to her til she apologized to me. About a month later she sent me an “apology” that basically said “I’m sorry but everything I said was true” 
This made me angry but I decided to be the bigger person and forgave this fake apology. I told her I understand she may be going through things of her own and that life can be a lot. I told her I see her as family now and even called her my sister. I told her I’d be there for her if she ever needed me.  She then proceeded to get angry with me saying everything she said was backed up and that she’d give me a real apology once she sees some “adulting”. At this point I was just angry and told her to stay away from me, and my baby, then called her a psycho cunt. 

Our gender reveal was coming up and I told my bf she is not to come into my home to celebrate our baby after insulting me and my motherhood without an apology. He agreed with me, if she gives a real apology, then she can come to the reveal. She refused. She then made a post on Facebook saying “being an expecting mother and giving off skanky pussy vibes isn’t cute” 

My bf was pissed after seeing this and confronted her. She continued to tell him flat out lies about me and my pregnancy. Saying I told my ex boyfriend I was pregnant before I told him, that I’m a crazy bitch using him to get a baby, etc. 
his parents messaged me asking me if I could “put my feelings aside” just for an hour so she could come. I told them absolutely not. Not without an apology. She still refused so she told his parents if they go to our babies gender reveal she won’t allow them to see their grandson (5M). They said I was being childish and should be the bigger person but I’m past that. 

My bf asked if I could suck it up so his parents would at least go but I still absolutely refused as I was disgusted with the whole families behavior in handling the situation.

He will go out for “walks” get lost, not answer his phone, making us call the police (we’ve even had to file missing persons reports) 

He is a stereotypical 1950s man who can't be bothered to cook or clean

He’s now into watching tv, and you’d think that's fine right? No it's not. He will interrupt my brother watching on the weekends and start berating him, even though they’re home all day and can watch, but my brother doesn’t have time till we get off school. He doesn’t know how to put on his own shows so he will start to YELL at my brother to put on his stuff, and then hide the remote so my brother can’t watch what he wants later. 

My parents spend hours, take days off, to shuffle them around to drs appointments, get their prescriptions refilled, and it's not once in a while, it's 2-3x a week.

My mother doesn’t even like their behavior and sometimes she snaps. 

A couple years ago my parents bought a car that is a “7 seater” and in reality is 5 with room for 1 legless passenger in the back which is the trunk that has fold out seats and I’ve always been the one to sit back there whenever my grandparents come in the car with us and sometimes they forget about me there, or they don’t even care about me literally sitting in a ball because there's no space. 

These are just the tip of the iceberg. 

Many of you might be saying “why don’t you talk to your parents?” I have. I’ve spent hours sobbing my life away, I’ve locked myself in my room to get away, I’ve dreaded going home because they’d be there, I’ve begged and pleaded with my parents to make them go, and it worked. For 6 months. Those were the best 6 months in a long time. My mom “listens” to me but then doesn’t. She claims she gets it but she doesn't. But she does have discussions with her parents and they just. Do. Not. Listen. I truly love my mother, she’s nothing like her parents which I am so grateful for and she too is put in a tough spot bc they are her parents who are going to need help, and if something happens to them while they aren’t living here, she’s responsible to go take care of them (her words not mine, I don’t agree with this). Personally, she didn’t choose her parents but she chose to have kids, so I think she should pick us over them. Today I was just told that they're probably not leaving and they'll always be here.

I told my boyfriend that if he was uncomfortable with me stealing during this trip just to keep a distance and then he responded with “Why steal when I can just pay for you?” A little more context, my boyfriend makes over triple of what I make in a year and he does buy me gifts. He also doesn’t pay for everything like the way he did years ago when we first started dating. So we go into the store, I immediately find the item that I was looking for and then I told him I need a few more things I was out of. I grabbed four other items. We spent a long time in the store and he saw everything that I was carrying in my hands. When we get close to the register he said “wow you’re not stealing today?” I looked at him confused because the only reason why I didn’t was because he said he’d pay. When I reminded him that he said he’d pay he reluctantly put all the items on the counter and said “well you better appreciate your christmas gift.” This set me off. This man can spend money like crazy and this was something he easily would’ve paid for the first 6 months of the relationship so for him to joke like that in front of the cashier felt insulting and hurtful so I said “I didn’t realize you were so cheap.” I get how hypocritical it sounds but the way he was making a big deal out of paying for my stuff after he gave me the impression he was paying made me feel like I’m not worth it anymore.

I'm not sure if I'm the asshole in this situation, but I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

So, I was at a fancy restaurant with my girlfriend, and we were having a great time. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was romantic, and everything was perfect.

Suddenly, the waiter came over with the bill, and I looked at it and gasped. It was way more expensive than I thought it would be, and I didn't have enough cash on me to pay for it.

I looked at my girlfriend and said, ""Honey, I'm sorry but I think we're going to have to split the bill.""

She looked at me with a shocked expression and said, ""What? You can't be serious! I thought you were taking me out for a nice dinner.""

I tried to explain that I didn't know the prices were so high, and that I didn't mean to ruin the night, but she just got angry and started yelling at me.

Eventually, she ended up leaving the restaurant without paying the bill, and I didn’t have the money to cover it and just left what I had. Now I'm worried that the waiter will come after us.

Context: I (16f) have one set of grandparents, who are my mom’s (40f) parents, they moved here/with us when I was in 5th grade and since then it has been hell. My grandparents are old and their only child is my mom, and they moved here so she could take “care” of them (they are riddled with health issues). So they’ve lived here in 2 increments, 5 years and then left for 6 months, and then came back again 4 months ago. Part of the reason they left is because of what they’ve done to me. (for context we are an asian-american family living in the US, iykyk)

My grandparents have literally ruined my life. Just to start, they have given me mental illness. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and ocd and I think they were a big contributor to the development and worsening of it. 

My grandma is probably the worst of the 2 evils. She micromanages my whole family, (consists of me, mom, dad (44m), and brother (11m)), she gaslights, guilt trips, manipulates, is controlling, ignores boundaries/rules, is hyper critical, any form of emotional abuse you can think of she’s done it. 

My grandpa on the other hand interacts with me less but that doesn’t make him better. He yells, acts more like a toddler than a toddler does, and is a man child. 

Here are some amazing stories of the shit I go through:

My grandma constantly berates us if we don’t eat what she wants us to eat, she says things like “I won’t eat unless you do bc I feel your starvation” (even after I will have eaten takeout, or not be hungry etc.)

On the day of my 5th grade graduation I wore a blue dress and I thought I looked nice, and as I come down the stairs she has shitty comments “you should wear leggings underneath” “you’re so sickly you look blue’ 

I don’t really speak my native language, (I can but it’s difficult for me) but I do understand it completely, however, my grandparents don’t speak English and I vividly remember during a family get together a family member asked them how they liked it here and and my grandma says “oh well my grandkids don’t even talk to me, they hate us, I wish my grandkids were like your kids” 

The constant nagging is incredible, mainly about eating. She’s constantly getting me to eat and if I don’t eat what they want me to, it's over for me. Her and my grandpa constantly yell and I’m not used to that so it really stresses me out. She’s a hoarder and it's disgusting, she also cannot clean because of how much of a hoarder she is, and she has disgusting habits (yk when sometimes there's pee on the toilet seat and you wipe it away and throw the toilet paper in the toilet? Yea well she wipes it with toilet paper and then KEEPS IT on the edge of the toilet for “next time”) because of things like this I can’t even bear to use the bathroom next to my room bc it's the one they use.

I posted on here awhile ago about family things, (I took it down bc the mods said i needed to post it somewhere else) and a lot of people told me (based on the background info i gave them) that I should call CPS. I talked to a school counselor about it, and toyed with the idea for about 2-3 weeks. Well I was talking to my bestfriend today, bc something just recently happened for these feelings to come back up (even tho they come up everyday in this hell hole) and she walked me though what would happen if I called cps. 

Well I gained the balls to do call. I called CPS from a phone from the school today (12-2-2022), and now it's being reviewed on whether they will investigate it or not. 

So now it is just a waiting game.

My girlfriend's friend she's known since high school (we're in our early/mid-20s) invited us both to a christmas party, to which we accepted.

However, tonight I received an invitation from a talent agency in my city to play trumpet in a wedding gig, the same night as the party. I really did not want to skip the party, but I also really wanted to play at the gig, as I have always wanted performing gigs to be a regular part of my life. I haven't played any gigs since the spring, though, which was my 1st ever wedding gig, so you can imagine I extremely excited to have someone reach out to me.

So, I was afraid that if I didn't take this gig, I would not get another call back: the last 2 times I had been offered a gig, I had to turn it down (for one I was busy with my gf, and the other was too far to be worth it - 3hr drive each way!!!). The way I see it, if I keep turning down gigs then nobody is going to offer me any in the future, since I will have established a reputation for being unavailable/unreliable. So, after careful deliberation, and discussion with my girlfriend, I accepted the gig.

Here's where I may be TA: I cancelled plans I had previously made in order to play this gig. I asked my gf if she would be mad if I did this, and she said while she understood why I felt I needed to accept it, she was still mad that I would bail out on the party and she'd have to go alone. I feel terrible about cancelling, but I also feel that if I didn't take the gig, it could be a major setback for me in the music industry, which I would feel even more terrible about.

I politely declined and said I was busy, but I honestly thought such a late and indirect invitation was VERY weird.

My (33f) mom (53f) says I’m arrogant, but I believe I’m just setting healthy boundaries. Two details for context:

1. My mom recently gave me $2k to help pay for emergency vet care.
2. My grandfather (92m, her father) suddenly needs assisted living. We’re not well off, so this is stressful financially. She’s frustrated because my uncle (\~56m, her brother) is well off but hasn’t offered to pitch in.

During a call, my mom expressed frustration with my uncle for being “tight” with his money. I said it was disappointing given that it’s his own father. She said it’s upsetting that I fail to see any bad in him. I said that wasn’t fair because I just acknowledged otherwise. She acknowledged that I said that, but then called us “arrogant.” She referenced a conversation he and I had years ago where he shared how much he makes, and she added, “He tells you this information but doesn’t tell his own siblings?” She expressed the belief we have private conversations like this regularly, so I told her what our conversations are about (grandparents, pets). I again said it wasn’t fair of her to call me arrogant and was owed an apology. She replied, “Okay yea, I’M sorry. I’M wrong. YOU’RE right.” I hung up and started texting her.

I explained that her anger was displaced and that it wasn’t fair of her to lash out at me. I said she used to steamroll me like this as a child, but I’m an adult now and won’t allow it. She said, “Yeah an adult who still needed financial help” and reiterated that I was being arrogant. She has expressed remorse in the past for being emotionally abusive to me growing up, and I told her that remorse means nothing if she continues to do it now. She said she’s sorry she’s angry at me but she’s mad that I won’t divulge how much money my uncle makes. I said I wished she had just asked me directly because I had no idea that’s why she was so upset. I reiterated that conversation with him was years ago, so I don’t know how much he makes right now. I again said I’m owed an apology for her lashing out at me. She said, “Wow. Same as last time. Even though we’re going through this horrible time, it comes down to you again. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. My stomach is in knots but I’m sorry.” I said, “A horrible circumstance isn’t an excuse to treat someone unfairly. You always have a choice in how you treat others.” She told me to stop texting her after that.

Each week, before grocery shopping, I ask him if he has any grocery requests. Most weeks he automatically answers “no” without a second thought. 
Yesterday, he goes to the kitchen to make “nachos”. Normally, we have a shredded “nacho making” cheese of some type on hand, but none this week for whatever reason, nor did he request any. 
So, he grabs the nice brand of Parmesan to make his nachos. I say, “Dear husband, could you please not use the expensive Parmesan to make nachos? I also have that set aside for a recipe for tomorrow”. He tells me it will be fine and uses it anyway. 
Next thing I know, he’s dipping his melted Parmesan cheese covered chips directly into the open jar of salsa. I say, “Dear husband, could you please get a bowl for your nachos, as we all use that salsa (meaning me, of course) and maybe don’t want cheese and chip crumbles in it? And also, I use that salsa when cooking and don’t want to have to buy another jar.” He responds with, “CAN I DO ANYTHING RIGHT??” And then proceeds to tell me it’s his house too, he paid for the salsa too, and he’ll continue to eat them how he wants to because he’s been doing it this way for 12 years.

I love my husband very much and he is very gentle, sweet and funny. We get along well but the only point of contention over the years has been money. This is a second marriage for both of us. Both of us have 2 kids each. His are older and have graduated college and working. Mine are in middle school. 

We both work and earn good salaries but his is about $100K more than mine. 

My ex was very abusive towards me and fought me every step of the way for custody in a long drawn out battle. The past several years, I have had to go to court time and again to keep my kids safe (they have been emotionally, verbally and sometimes physically abused) leading to draining off my savings. 

My kids and I are in therapy and I pay all of it out of pocket. I’ve tried to keep my kids in extracurriculars that they like (one plays club sports which can get  expensive to the tune of $6-7K per year). My mortgage, utilities and groceries is about $5-6K/month. I live paycheck to paycheck. My husband earns more and gets massive bonuses yearly ($40K+).

H and I have kept separate finances from the beginning. His first wife was a SAHM. He paid for everything in that marriage. When we met and got married, his kids were going to Ivy League and he was paying $75K per year per child.

After marriage, he moved into my house and refused to pay much ($500) saying my existing expenses were a fixed cost and his moving in did not add to it. After more than a year and several discussions, he started paying around $2500/month. 

He hears me voice my financial struggles but never offers to help even with kids. The only thing he spends on voluntarily for the kids and me is eating out. He did pitch in with kids sports fees couple of times after I asked him. This past year I could not afford to go on vacations any more so he paid for 2-3 of them (usually we split all expenses in half). 

2 days back I asked him to help a bit with one of my kids fees. He agreed after looking very pensive and then gave me a spiel on how he has spent a lot this year and will not be able to spend on any big ticket items next year. He even brought up a dining table he paid for when our old one broke. 

I just got very upset at that and told him that I feel very alone in this marriage and that he has a very hands off approach to me and my kids whenever money is a factor. He said he is sorry I feel that way but money causes friction so he prefers to keep his money to himself. 

It’s been 2 days and I’m still very upset at his callousness. I’m struggling and stressed out. I sold some shares that I had to give him my half of the vacations and dining table. He accepted it and has not said anything more.

My dad and I until recently used to have a great relationship but lately we’ve been having big disagreements. Most of it is around my major and the career path I want to do, which he strongly and vocally disagrees with. He pays my college tuition including housing and food so I guess he does get a say but we always end up arguing and I get so stressed out / frustrated by him.

Anyways we had a disagreement/argument yesterday over FaceTime. After the call I realized I don’t want to see him at Christmas or spend time with him. And then I realized I don’t have to! So I canceled my flight and I'm planning to go to my bf's friend's house for Christmas day.

I texted my dad tonight that I won't be visiting for Christmas since I don't want to be around him and that I already canceled my flight.

She also has my niece (12F) with her. They're currently living in Section 8 housing so they don't have to worry too much about rent and also have food stamps.

I had enough today and drove with my mom to get the car. She asks me why I'm taking the car. I ask her has she saved any money, have you worked in the last two, three months. She's silent.

This is my (20F) first date ever, I am a seamstress/cosplayer and I love making my own clothes and costumes. 
I was/am on my period during this time so my emotions were not quite in check. 

The guy I went on a date with (Kevin 23) has been on dates before and knows me, knows that I make my clothes and knows how I dress can be a bit much for certain people. 
He lives an hour away from where I wanted to go on our date (a botanical garden) and works most days so we had to figure out a way to get a date where we both had a day off of work.



I explained a little over text on the way there that I'm nervous because it's my first date and I didn't want things going south because I do really like him. 
He's a cool guy and doesn't seem to mind my quirks or strange interests. (I'm a coquette/fairy goth living in a small town in the buckle of the Bible belt...) 

I also wanted to make sure I looked nice, so I made my own outfit. 
pleated mini skirt, sweetheart puff short sleeve bow front crop top with a fuax corset belt on top. some lolita style shoes and knitted socks too. Nothing too crazy especially since it's very similar to what I usually wear. Just nicer. Now, it's not his fault that I put this effort in, nor do I regret it, my outfit is cute and he didn't request I dress special. (I'm just adding this so you know that I have some extra emotional attachment to my outfit here. My dementia raven way outfit description is just to give a visual of what I look like) 

So when we arrive, we get out of our cars and walk to the entrance. 

The first thing he says to me is, 

Kevin: *looks me up and down with a weirded out look on his face, chuckles a bit and facepalms* ""What are you wearing??"" 

Now, *I am on my period* I cry easy on my period, but the way he looked at me like I was a clown and asked ""what are you wearing?""  before even saying hi made me a tad too emotional for my own good. 

I felt like I was about to cry so instead of crying and possibly making the situation worse, I just turned around got right back in my car and left. 

he tried calling me but I didn't pick up so
later he texted me saying that I shouldn't have wasted his time and money if I was just going to leave without a word and that I'm rude for making him drive out of his way for nothing. 

I didn't respond but I do feel guilty about it since he doesn't usually get days off and the one time he does I managed to mess it up. But I am kinda mad at him because I wouldn't have left if he didn't say that ""what are you wearing?"" thing.

She nodded solemnly and asked if I was putting Christmas decorations up on the eighth then. I said I wasn't.

She was really upset and asked why I hate Christmas and am trying to ruin the Christmas season.

After we graduated, I moved to a different state to be with family after receiving some very devastating medical news, but we still kept in touch and they were there for me as much as they could be, stepping in for support whenever my family couldn't. After I got better, the three of us moved into a house together and D and I got very close, going out on one (very awkward) date that ended in an uncomfortable kiss and from then on we decided we'd be better off as best friends.

Three years and the discovery that I am asexual/aromantic later, D got a new girlfriend, S (28F), and was completely taken with her. A and I suggested inviting her over to meet her and maybe introduce her to some of our friends since she was new to the city and didn't know many people. S was incredibly sweet, if a little shy, but A and I liked her and thought she was a good fit for D. We started inviting her to our nights out, movie nights, etc. and after she began spending the night more and more I started buying extra snacks and drinks that D told me she liked to keep at the house to help make her feel comfortable.

After a while D mentioned to us that S was concerned about how close we were and told us several issues she had: things like how much we hugged, how I wear shorts and crop tops around the house, how we share blankets during movie nights, that we text him too much etc. A and I were a little annoyed but they were little issues so we gave him and S more space and I started to wear longer shirts and pants if I knew she was over. 

Everything came to a head at the friendsgiving dinner I hosted. It's a big deal to me and I send out invites a month in advance to make sure I can make enough food and know everyone's dietary restrictions as I cook everything from scratch. After telling me S couldn't make it, D showed up with her when everyone was getting ready to eat. I welcomed her in but told her I wasn't expecting her and didn't know if I had anything for her to eat but offered to either give her my plate, make something for her, or go out and get her something if nothing sounded good. 

S went off. She accused me of all sorts of things that basically added up to the idea I was trying to steal D from her. I bluntly told her I wasn't interested in him and she knocked the plates of food off the table yelling that she knew D and I had dated and I still wanted him, that I was faking my sexuality to play hard to get and that I was two-faced for trying to still be her friend.

I could've handled the yelling but after she wasted the food I had spent all day cooking, I told her she was delusional and to get the hell out and D took her home. He hasn't spoken to A or I since, outside of saying that he and S were fighting and I didn't have to call her crazy. I don't think I was wrong to kick her out but I do feel guilty and wonder if I could've handled things differently.

My friend meredith, who’s mom has cancer, recently got a huge amount of bills to paid despite having insurance to cover her surgery and other treatments, most of us pitch in, she maxed her credit card and drained her savings, she’s still short $15.000.
From the 5 of us Fred is the most successful one, he used to be a foster kid who has a full scholarship, and he created a software for gym, and now he lives lavish lives in penthouse suite got expensive cars.
He’s very generous with us, he often invite us to dinner, always take us if he got invited to a new club, nice birthday and christmas gifts. 
So mer borrowed money from fred to take care the rest of the outstanding amount, he asked her on how is she going to pay him back with no savings and maxed credit cards, she said she’s going to take a personal loan at the bank to pay him back, pay her credit cards, and save the rest for emergency in case her mom got hospitalized again. He wired her the money and said that he could never relate to her since he never had a mom growing up.
Now mer is on a business trip that she’s been postponing due to her mom being ill, she’s the only family her mom got left. She lost her brother and dad in an accident 12 years a go.
Now the loan got longer than expected at the bank, she said because she max her credit card she just use 90% of her salary to pay for her credit cards to get a better credit score, and the system hasn’t updated yet so it might took a while to pay him back.
He told her that he’s going to Rome by end of month and if he didn’t receive the money in 2 weeks he’ll cancel his trip and mer has to pay his first class unrefundable round trip ticket too. Every night around 11pm-1am fred texted mer asking her how the loan process, and if it didn’t get through how is she going to pay him back. He even ask her once in our group text.
Yesterday i met him for lunch, he showed me a coats and boots he’s going to get for his italy trip and it cost more than what mer’s owe him, he also show me the picture of the villa he rented and he cant wait for the trip. And then he mentioned that mer is pulling an Anna Delvey on him, bailing on paying back and blaming on the bank. 
I dont know why i lashed out i told him that its different, anna use the money to buy luxurious shits and live in a hotel, not paying for a cancer treatment. And its not a habit of her of borrowing money. And lets cut his bs about depending his trip on the money mer’s owe him, stop acting like a debt collector every night and be a friend.
And he said that its none of my business, he never owes anyone anything, he said that you guys should work harder instead of depending your finance on your salary, savings, credit cards and gofundmepage, and then he stormed off.

She's always been a mooch, but I genuinely didn't care if she needed something that I could give, far expensive car rides, pay for food, lend her money, etc. she was my friend.

She met a dude on Bumble and left everything for him after a week of talking and moved to another city, he reminded her he didn't want a serious relationship. She moved in with me after her cousin refused to let her move in. No problem, but she said she'd stay for a week which turned into a month, whatever, she's my friend. She went through my clothes, picked out everything that fit her since I am taller and thinner than her, asked me if she could have them, bras, shirts, sweaters, tights, silk scarves, etc. I said ok.

She said she might move to another friend's house. After 2 days, she literally told me ""I'm just gonna stay here because you feed me, if I go with our friend, I will spend a lot of money because she likes to eat out,"" and proceeded to stay until she ""made up"" with the bumble guy.

She moved close to me again with her new BF and their roommate. She used me as an excuse to convince their roommate who apparently has a crush on me to buy a TV for their new apartment because I was ""dying to see Twilight"" and the apartment had no TV, so if he bought it, I'd have sleepovers there and he'd get a chance to see me more often. I don't even like Twilight.

I started to notice strange comments she made throughout a 4 month span.

I come from money but I don’t think it makes me better that others nor do I flaunt it, I simply have things I like that I wear. I have multiple designer bags, don't even point out it is designer because to me, flaunting is kinda petty. She grabs it from under my arm, looks at it, and says ""designer bag and all and there's a scratch on it"". I laughed and said ""yeah... I should have taken better care of it.""

We were having dinner with 5 other friends and she proceeded to loudly say ""remember when your fiancé came to Mexico for the first time, had street tacos and had diarrhea all over?"" and laughed. I got irritated because that didn't even happen.

Today, I tried to look less ""flashy"" though I always wear multiple sets of diamond rings and necklaces, she asked me to take them off to see them and so she could try them on. I had a small hole on a long sleeve shirt right on my armpit, she touches the hole and says, ""you act like you wear Gucci and your shirt has a hole"". I just looked at her and asked for the check.

The list goes on but I've had it. A part of me wants to think she's a bit tone deaf, because she can be very sweet.

He almost never gets sick. Me on the other hand, I'm very sickly. Before the pandemic started, I used to catch a cold almost every month, but after these last 2 years the most we have been sick is a mild case of covid, wich we endured.  


So, here we are last week, both really excited for a metal concert we have been looking forward to assist since 2 months ago. Everything is planned. All the stages/artists, transportation, the hotel we are staying. He payed for tickets and everything because thats what we do. One event I'm paying for everything, this time he was in charge.  


But since wednesday, he has started to act sick. He started saying he felt his lungs weird, and coughing a little. He also has been taking his temperature every 10 minutes (mind you, that's really annoying), but he is always under 98.6 ºF / 37 ºC. He is acting like he is on his deathbed, he always does whenever he starts feeling sick regardless of the severity of the cold.   


I can understand he is feeling weird. It's not comfortable to have a sore throat. However, I don't find it incapacitating. And he is. He is having second thoughts about assisting to the festival. I'm trying to tell him to endure it, grab some naproxen and cough treatment(which he refuses saying ""it's not that bad""), and try to go and enjoy it. But as the night ends he is more and more determined that he feels pretty bad. (Mind you, his temperature just reached 37.4 ºC / 99.3 ºF)  


I, on the other hand, am feeling ok. I'm not having any symptoms, and I'm very excited about this metal fest. Our daughter passed away 2 months ago, and while I'm devastated I'm trying to continue living; besides I feel like she would have loved to assist with us and that I own that to her (she was our little metal head). I feel like if he is feeling that sick, he could stay and get some rest (even tho I still think it's not that bad.. I can't help but compare his mild symptoms to the ones our baby had before she died). Ultimately he has the last word about me going since he is the one who purchassed the tickets and hasnt printed them; but I'd like to ask him if I could just go by myself. However, I don't want to be the asshole and live himm all sick by himself (the metal fest is just tomorrow and I'd be back on sunday)

See all of my kids are adopted except my twins and I recently just adopted my 16 almost a year ago and I wanted his adoption celebration to be special.
