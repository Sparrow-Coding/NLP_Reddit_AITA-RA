We recently found out it was a girl and started thinking about names. My boyfriend (26M) wants to name her Mikayla. I on the other hand prefer something more old fashioned, and want to name her Octavia. 

The other day my boyfriends mom (60F) was over for dinner and asked us if we decided on a name yet. We told her both of our choices, and of course she sided with my boyfriend. She said that if we name our daughter Octavia she will be bullied in school and end up hating her name. 

I told them both that “old lady names” are in style right now and that her class mates will have similar names. I also said it could be way worse (I know a little girl named “Sevyn”) and that people are naming their kids some crazy things.

They doubled down and I got frustrated, saying that I was the one who had to carry her for 9 months and should be in charge of naming her. 

I said it out of frustration but I do believe what I said. I’m the one who has to be in constant discomfort and I’m the one who has to experience likely the worst pain of my life while giving birth. 

His mom got upset at this and said that my bf has just as much say in the name since it “takes 2 to tango”. 

After this I told my boyfriend I would be willing to compromise and choose a less obvious old fashioned name like Lilly or Ruby, but he didn’t like any of those suggestions either. 

So AITA for telling my boyfriend that I should choose the name since I’m the one who has to be pregnant? Also WIBTA if I still insist on naming her the name I picked?

She was constantly taking her to lunch, museums, and even to her cottage in another province. At the time, I really internalized what she did. I convinced myself that there was something wrong with me and that it was my fault my aunt preferred my sister. As we got older, I stopped caring about my aunt's opinion and just chalked it up to her being a shitty person. Fast forward to a couple of summers ago, Cara and I were at our parent's cabin for the weekend with some friends, and Louise shows up with boxes full of their old China and gave it all to my sister, right in from of me. Don't get me wrong, I have no desire for anyone's old dishes, but it brought back a bunch of old insecurities, so I was a bit withdrawn the rest of the weekend, but not in a way that anyone would really notice. So on the last day, the Louise dishes thing got brought up again (don't remember who brought it up). Cara said that the reason why Louise favored her is that she had it so much harder growing up since I was apparently always having tantrums. I told her that doesn't square with my memories and left it at that. A few minutes later when it was just the two of us in the cabin, Cara said that I can't have tantrums like this on our next trip. I'm not even sure what she was taking about since (at most) I was a bit reserved, but certainly didn't make a big deal about it in front of anyone else. I ended up leaving an hour or so early. I didn't make a scene, I just left. I didn't think it was a big deal and kind of expected to just move on, but she seemed to not want to let it go. For my parents sake, I ended up apologizing. I expected my sister to apologize for her part. She didn't, so I swallowed my pride and moved on. I was prepared to never bring up the situation again, but she's brought it up a few times and uses it to further her victim narrative. I was fine to let it go, but since she seems to want to bring it up continuously, I decided I was not going to spend the rest of my life with her believing herself to be a victim. I  told her that my apology was meant to acknowledge and take accountability for my part in the incident, but that I in no way was taking responsibility for 100% of the situation. She didn't text me back, but my dad told me that she told my mom that she wasn't going to apologize, that I was completely to blame. After hearing this, I texted her and let her know that I don't need an apology from her if she really believes that she's 100% blameless, but that I needed her to know my perspective, if it was something that was going to be continuously brought up. She hasn't responded. I don't know what to do. I don't think I should have to suck it up and accept 100% responsibility just to coddle her.

DA/ Daughter BF/ boyfriend

MY DA called me about helping her find a house in my area. I told her the one next door to me would be up for rent soon. DA and BF wanted to come see the house. They drove down (3 hours away). I told them both the house still had a tenant in it but he had no problem with them (DA and BF) coming to see the house. I had to have the tenant evicted and he still had 2 weeks to get out. I have not see the inside of the house in 3 months. When DA and BF and me went in the house it was gross and had small damages done to it. They freaked out and left and told me they have to pass on it. I let her know it was no big deal. The house had flies and flys and smelled bad the carpets were nasty and it looked like the tenant had not been cleaned in a while.

My husband (DA Dads) figured he would clean it out and spray for fleas and have the carpet steam cleaned. However, his hours at work picked up and he was unable to do anything but clean out all the junk left behind and sprayed for fleas. Fast forward about 2 months later Da called me and asked if she could barrow $100 to $200 dollars the her and BF were struggling. I told DA that I know I can do $100. Da then spoke with her Dad (My Husband) and he said that we could do $200 and don't worry about paying back that we understand. Then 2 weeks later DA called me and stated that were she is living is not working out for her and she now has cockroaches and her landlord (she sublets) would not do anything about it and that the lady that lives next door to her (duplex) refused to use any type of product to help get rid of them. DA then proceeded to tell me that she was informed she could not use the back yard or front yard at all. DA then goes on about how bad the crime is around her house. DA then asked if I still had the house next to me up for rent. I told her that it still needs a lot of work but her Dad would help her and BF to get it put together but it would take some time. I informed her that her Dad's hours have picked up and we did not have time to do anything with the house. I told her no deposit and the first month rent will be waived and the utilities and then rent would be $600 per month (mortgage is $500 per month plus insurance $100) and she pays the utilities. Da and BF agreed to this and head down to the house.

I asked her what the matter was and she kept saying she was fine. Eventually she just went quiet. I tried reaching out but she wasn’t having any of it.

I messaged everyone and asked if they could please try to get some photos of me at events, especially with my daughter. Over the summer, we had a trip to Tahoe &amp; a camping trip, and everyone sent me videos and photos they got. They were all videos &amp; photos taken with Snapchat &amp; just poor quality. I was pretty disappointed that I didn’t get anything decent. I still like printing photos out &amp; the prints didn’t come out all that great.

Over the next few months, same thing. I’ve asked everyone to try using their own phone cameras then uploading later, but nobody seems to really think it’s a big deal.

Last night, we went to a tree lighting in town &amp; I noticed my mom was using snapchat again to get videos of my daughter and I. I had my daughter on my shoulders, so I couldn’t really get videos myself. I reminded my mom to stop using snapchat &amp; it upset her.

I try to befriend everyone. I began working at a shoe store. it's been about a month and there is a lot of drama. I do not know what rumors have been spread and people are not working as a community. I was told by my manager that the person had notified them that I'm not doing my job right and I'm putting  shoes in the wrong area. I did not say that to her or encourage her at all. I do have an issue in the back because I can't see far so it takes me a bit. My next day back my manager tested me and I got one shoe in the wrong location and she corrected my mistake I told her sorry it won't happen again and Texted jamie to clear up the  misunderstanding that I did not say that at all and told her what actually happened- I was told by my manager to resort levis and i spent almost all day doing it  putting  away my only drag/shoes were 1 pair of vans and uggs that were tan. With the vans I couldn't find em so i set the down and went to ask someone unfortunately everyone was busy it's black friday and most of the other shoe put  left for home already so I came back re analyzed and found the shoe bit there was no space so like other employees i put in on the other shelf right beside it. The tan uggs I set down on the black uggs pile because the tan are buried under the black and asks to resort and make room for the black uggs and had a pile that other people out of random shoes that's not supposed to be there I was not helped in re-sorting these uggs but after I made some room I put the shoes back. I simply explained that to her and how it was unfair for the manager to test me when they knew what I was doing and I thought I was going to get fired or something. I was not at all aggressive in my text to Jamie. I even told her I'm not accusing her and I'm not saying she's out to get me fired or my manager is at all !

I asked everyone because of all the rumors about me saying My manager is out to get me. I don't want any drama. My parents are getting divorced so I have enough of it already I just want to work and go home and help my mom.

I refused to sign my write up and Now.im going to talk with my manager because it  says I texted a coworker aggressively and stated that my favorite manager(that trained me) is out to get me fired.

Be brutally honest. I need opinions from both men and women, please state that if it's okay ofc.

My fiance (27m) and I (27f) have been together for more than 3 years and getting married in a few months. We have been committed to each other since the beginning, there have been no trust issues so far whatsoever.

My fiance is a super social man, with lots of friends, I'd say %70 of them are women. He's a charming, easy to get along guy, so I understand it. I'm also friends with almost all of his friends, and I love them dearly. Except for this one girl.

So this girl is 19 yo. They know each other for more than 4 years I'd say. Before my fiance and I met even.

Let me tell you the reason I despise this girl. A few months into our relationship, she once texted my then boyfriend ""I'm freaking IN LOVE WITH you lol"" (allegedly jokingly) And bf just said haha I love u too lol. And he on purpose showed me this text exchange, to show how nice she is. I was like wtf. How does she say this to a man in a commited relationship? And then my bf told me I'm overreacting, saying how she calls him big bro and he calls him lil sis. But I can never forget this. 

They have met outside from time to time. I've never made a fuss about it, since they're friends and it's not up to me to limit his relationships with his friends. 

However, I have always avoided meeting her, and made it clear to my bf. Even though he always wanted me to get to know her, to see she's just a naive, nice, bubbly kid. I'm not gonna befriend someone who is ""in love with my bf"".

So today, we finally had to meet for on occasion. Some of his friends who are also my friends were there as well and I had great time hanging with them.

This girl when she saw immediately jumped and hugged me ""SISTER ITS SO NICE TO MEET YOU"". I was like, umm, okay hi. And I avoided her during the day, didn't get in conversation with her.

Btw, she has a bf of like 1,5 years. And she still clings to our other boy friends; hugging them, locking arms with them, putting head over their shoulders and whatnot. I pray to god she doesn't do this to my fiance.

Now my fiance scolded me after the event, saying how cold I was to her. Since like 2 years ago, I made it clear that I will not like her and not befriend someone who said they're in love with my partner. I asked why does it matter, you can still be friends, as always. Why do I have to like her, or pretend that I like her?

I moved away over a decade ago to another province and only get to see him a few times a year when I go home to visit. 

My cousin Vick got engaged over a year ago and he has been pretty finicky with wedding arrangements. He wasn't sure if he wanted a wedding here or back in Asia.
 

So I decided to come back to my hometown this Christmas which is a rarity as I hate traveling during the holidays and it can be difficult to get leave time approved during December. Thankfully,  I got my vacation approved late October. I let my family know including Vick. No mentions about anything pertaining to a wedding.

So my cousin texted me yesterday saying 'That's awesome your in town, December 17th, Dinner reception, invites will be sent asap' 

While I was happy that I was in town for this event, I was also kind of surprised of the last minute arrangements and told him it was rather odd he choose to do it now and a week before Christmas none the less. I realize I had plans  arranged that that weekend but I would cancel it due to attending my cousins reception. 

My cousin said that he kind of decided when his father returned from Asia last week for a visit ( his father has been living on and off in Asia for the last several years). 

So my beautiful people of reddit, you might be wondering what my father has to do in this equation.  

I haven't seen my father in over 20 years, my father was a special type of denegrate who was addicted to gambling. I'll try to keep this short but in a nutshell, my father sold/lost/gambled pretty much everything away, and what was left was seized by  the banks/government. 

I remember myself, mother and two siblings trying to cram as much as our belongings in a 92 Pontiac that thankfully my mother kept away from my dad so he couldn't sell it. During this time frame, my father was packing some of his belongings and when he was finished, he quickly came over to me and my siblings and said he was sorry and he needed to leave and that's was it. This was over 20 years ago and him leaving was honestly the best thing for my family. The last few years leading up to this was pure hell. 

Fast forward to now, my life is so much better and my siblings, mother and myself were able to thrive without him.

I was told a few months ago that after 20 odd years, my dad has resurfaced back to my hometown. I was told he got approved government housing back home. 

I have no anger anymore towards my father but I also have zero emotion connection and I don't plan to talk to him or have any type of relationship with him either. He can live peacefully here as long as he doesn't  bother my mom as my mom is afraid he will come back like everything is fine..crazy right?! 

Well, my father will be invited to the reception I'm sure and I'm sure Vick's dad will try to play hero and have us all sit at a table together and that's

I have diagnosed infertility after 1083 days and 24 cycles with meds I finally got a positive Pregnancy test the Friday before thanksgiving. The next day I started cramping so badly at work I ended up in ER diagnosed with a miscarriage. Devastated doesn’t measure up to what I felt. I called my dad on Monday to ask how soon I should take my Turkey out and let him know. He informed me that everyone was gathering at grandmas for thanksgiving this year and if I didn’t come that was okay too. On thanksgiving stuff is in full swing, cramps awful, hormones are a dumpster I put the Turkey in and decided to go spend some time with grandma. I got to my grandmothers before everyone else so I could spend some time with just her, because I didn’t know how long I’d stay, I told her about why I was so early when I got there, she was very understanding. Just said I’m sorry. But you know kids aren’t all they sound like. Grandkids are better. With a tight hug. I recognize this is just her trying to be supportive so I let it go, took more ibuprofen and hung out a bit. Once more of my extended family arrived, the subject of babies came up. Now my hormonal sad ass couldn’t handle that conversation so I attempted to excuse myself from the room and head into the kitchen to see if I could help with anything in there. The subject of the loss came up and if we were going to try again. I’ll be 34 in a few months.  I said yes when we get the green light and we are ready we will try again, it’s something that means a lot to me. To which I received sorry but if it’s meant to be it is, kids aren’t worth it, you shouldn’t put all of those chemicals in your body, just adopt. I’ve gotten used to those comments, they aren’t helpful, but I recognize that’s how they are trying to be supportive. I just explained it’s important to us,i could feel the hormonal meltdown coming on, dinner was almost ready so I used the fact I was going to eat dinner with my hubby who was at home not feeling well as an excuse and  started saying goodbye to people. When one cousin followed me outside, mind you she’s had 3 babies, and told me that I was making a mountain out of a mole hill and to just get over it, it’s not a big deal and I’m ruining the day for grandma by leaving early, because of a dead fetus and to not come to anymore holidays until I figure my shit out. I just walked away and went home. A few days later my dad called to see how I was feeling and to remind me he left a piece of pie at grandmas for me. I told him what had said, that it had hurt and I’d likely go to their house for breakfast on x mas then go see grandma for a bit before everyone arrived then leave.

While i admit that i have not been in the right headspace lately, i feel like i have been “emotionally manipulating” her. 

I dont have a job.
I am struggling financially.
I have trouble sleeping.
I am pushing my friends away.
I have lost all motivation.
Some of the things I’ve been going through. 

My girlfriend has been nothing short but the exact opposite of this. She tells me all the things she wants to do, all the plans she has for the next 5 years. She tells me she wants to travel the world with all the money shes earning, she wants to start a family soon because a lot of her friends already are, etc. all these big plans involving me. When she talks about things like these i cant help but feel like I’m holding her back, and this sinking feeling knowing im far from being at the place she is at (emotionally &amp; financially). 

Well, last week we got into an argument, and i just.. snapped. She says shes tired of my constant dullness and its getting too much (among other things). I then replied that maybe im not the right person for her, and that maybe we should break up.

I love her with all my heart and i cant imagine myself without her, and i know she at least cares for me too. The combo of my mental issues, the argument, the feelings of failure, and her saying what she said just made me say what i said. Part of me thinks the reason for that is to see what reaction i can provoke out of her, hoping her reaction contradicts with my feelings, so at least i can tell myself that my negative feelings of shortcomings are invalid. Then again, that still does not justify my actions.

Perhaps IATA, and with that i should try to be better. I realised if the roles were reversed, i too would’ve feel drained with the constant presence of negative energy. Another thing is that in what way is her having big ambitions a bad thing? I think i just needed a place to express myself and get my thoughts straight.

We worked together on a project for 9 months, and about 2 months in he was already extending this same job to me at his next contract at a different company.

This happened and it was for a 15 month contract. I tried to negoiate my rate up $25 per day - he came back and said he could offer me the same rate as my last job, and that he already negotiated with the company on my behalf and that their standard rate was $25 less than what I was already making.

I believed him, but fast forward to 4 months in and he asks me to take on a new responsbility - sending out payroll reminders, collecting invoices/timesheets, tracking them, then compiling them in neatly into a zip folder for him to code and send to accounting. (basically, I do 90% he does 10%)

In doing this, I now had access to see what everyone was making. Not only was I the 2nd lowest paid employee, but there were mass rate discrepencies upwards of $300 a day in the same roles (ie between researchers). It made me realize that A) either there was room to negoiate that $25 increase, and I mistakenly trusted my boss/mentor OR B) the role that I am in, and my skills, are easily replaceable and therefore not worth matching rates of applicants.

This sucked, but at the same time, the rate still was livable for me. It wasn't until I got reno-victed, incurred a +$1000 increase in rent, and in the same week, found out my job and responsbilities for the first 2 seasons of this show, were split amongst 4 PEOPLE, that the resentment started to build.

Every two weeks when I did payroll, the resentment just continued to build, my mental health and self-esteem would be affected, and it would impact my work performance. Why am I working so hard if I am not valuable?

I don't want to quit my job before my contract ends, I don't feel I deserve a raise \[see impacting work performance\], I don't want to accuse my mentor of kind of screwing me, so I just want to ask to no longer do payroll. 

This would add around 3+hrs of work for him, so I am worried I'll get fired for refusing to do my job.

Is my request fair? Am I overacting? Are most people who do payroll are lower paid employees?

Hi,im sorry english isnt my first language so I will fail to write properly

So I (18) have 2 sisters, M (13) and L (15) and a brother (5). M is kinda the golden child of the family, she has been the youngest of us for a long time before my brother was born.

Last summer, my mother's friend gave my brother the opportunity to go to a famous amusement park by giving us 2 tickets she initally took for her son and herself. My mother wouldn't go with my brother so she said i had to, i was quite happy with the decision because it would have been an opportunity for me to bound with my little brother. 

As my brother and I were about to leave, M woke up and started to nag my mom to go with us, my mother obviously gave in and M came with us. I wasnt really happy with the decision because it would leave my other sister out, and M wouldn't be able to do any exciting attractions since we couldnt separate and my brother is too young for most of the attractions. 

When I pointed out this, my mother gave me a warning glare and told me to stop being mean to my sister.M told her not to wake up my other sister, my mother said that L wasnt interested in going anyway. I knew the latest statement was made up but i knew better than to anger her more. 

When we arrived at the park, I paid a ticket for my sister and the day started. We did most of the cute attractions for kids and M kept looking at me weird. At noon, we sat to eat the sandwiches i bought, we were supposed to eat at the restaurant of the park but i had to pay for my sister's ticket the budget was too tight.

 Later in the day, she asked me to let her do one of the coolest attractions of the park, the one you have to be a certain height to do. Usually it would have been fine. But i couldnt let her go because my brother couldnt do this, the wait was 40min+ and she didnt have her phone. I said that if she didnt yell at my mom to not wake up my other sister in the morning they could have gone together and that it was a pity.

She looked mad. When we came home she cried to my mother, saying i was mean to her in purpose. My mother punished me, saying how cruel and jealous i was and how it was a sin to be this ungrateful (?) I was sent to the bedroom L and I share and I saw that she has been crying, when i asked why she didnt even looked at me. I learned later that she was crying because she thought i didnt wake her up to come to the amusement park in purpose, which never happened. 

The rest of the following week was awful to the point i started to believe i really was in the wrong for not letting M just do this one attraction. my 18th birthday came 2 weeks after, nobody from my family wished me anything, I didnt get a gift. 

Today is M's birthday, my family remind me of this story at dinner, saying I should buy her tickets to the amusement park to apologise. I said that they should use the money they wouldnt use for my 18th birthday. My parents said that i had to pack my things and leave the house.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4850475,public,top,self,AITA for ruining my sister's birthday?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbnq62/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_birthday/,all_ads,6,,,,

She said ""I can usually ignore them, but I feel worse when you get on their side"". Once again I explained that I didn't agree with them nor was on their side, and that I was just trying to give some pointers because I heard her mumbling, and she said ""ok, but you should use your common sense and realize that if they're making fun of my build and then you ask me what I'm building I'm not going to take it well. Can't you think about how I'm going to take things before you say them?"" and I said no, because, well, I can't predict how she's going to react most of the time. She said I should, and at this point things were getting heated, so I said ""ok, but after I clear up the misunderstanding about what happened you should also understand that it was not an offense towards you"", but she said ""it IS an offense"", to which I replied ""no, it wasn't, I explained to you what I was trying to do, you should try to understand me too"", and she finally said ""oh so you can make me feel bad and I have to understand YOU"", disconnected from the game and blocked me on all social media and whatsapp.

The reason I asked this of her is that that's exactly how I would react if a friend said something that hurt me but then explained themselves and cleared up the misunderstanding, I would just say ""oh, ok, don't worry then"" and let it go immediately. But maybe I'm just too cold? Should I apologize to her?

Before I was born, my dad cheated on her several times. He was a high profile drug dealer but before she met him she was quite successful and did pretty well for herself. She never got involved in his business and wanted nothing to do with it. The police had been working on my dad’s arrest for a long time and did some kind of illegal workings to get him arrested. My mum had the evidence to prove that the police worked through illegal means to get the collar. She was given the choice to drop the evidence and testify against my dad or they’d arrest her in connection with him and she chose the jail time.

Cut to ten years later, she got released from prison and was forced to work a 12 hour shift five days a week to support me and my 3 other siblings. In this period of time she was severely awful to us (guidelines won’t let me say how but I’m sure you can infer). Whilst  all of my siblings had it bad from her, she’s a Muslim and I’m gay so she tended to channel most of the hatred into me (she doesn’t know but she hated that I was effeminate). She was medically diagnosed with OCD and would often become “mean” when anything challenged her order (the house was messy, or you couldn’t do something as efficiently as her). 

Cut to present day, I’m (19) and have outgrown her which meant the end to the “meanness”. She’s now moved on to gaslighting and nasty comments. It’s her birthday tomorrow and she wanted to spend the day in bed. I was tasked with cleaning the house top to bottom (her standard of cleaning is nothing like I’ve ever seen before). She storms down and begins yelling at me and swearing at me calling me a liar and saying the house isn’t clean. I tried to explain to her that I’d really tried  and put 4 hours into cleaning. She told me not to answer her back or she’d be “mean” to me again. I know life has been tough on her but I’m not her  stress ball, I don’t want to get her a present tomorrow.

I was seeing my boyfriend for around six months and for the most part our relationship was really good. We were seeing each other for around three months when he invited me to meet his parents which I was totally up for as he’d met mine and they really liked him. When I arrived at his house that evening I didn’t expect to face what I did. When entering the living room I saw his mother in a hospital bed it turned out that she was unable to feel anything from the neck down and was confined to a wheelchair or hospital bed if she was unwell. The reason I hadn’t been expecting this was because my boyfriend didn’t tell me anything. I was visibly shocked and I just felt like I needed some kind of warning before walking in there but I wasn’t given that opportunity.

When I asked him why he hadn’t told me he said it was not something he liked to discuss and that I should leave it. And I did leave it because I didn’t want to upset him. When he gets upset he drinks and can be quite insulting. I guess I just didn’t want to argue with him.

So about two weeks ago we were sitting in my living room watching a movie when he told me that he needed to be home by 6 pm to cook his mother’s dinner which I said was fine whatever he needed to do. We continued watching the movie and when I next looked at the clock it was now five past 6. So I brought up that he said he needed to be home by 6 pm for his mother. It was at this point that he flipped out at me. Screaming that I had no idea what he went through every day and that I shouldn’t involve myself in his family business. I told him I wasn’t trying to involve myself I was just reminding him of what he said about going home to cook his mother's dinner. He kept yelling at me and it attracted the attention of my parents who were upstairs. I decided that before my father kicked him out I should tell him to leave but he wouldn’t.

Long story short he did leave once my dad entered the room but once he left I was then sat down by my parents who said that I needed to end it now as he has a lot of issues and that they were worried about what this was doing to me and I agreed.

Since then a lot of our mutual friends have stopped speaking with me. I asked one of the only ones who was still talking to me what I had done to offend them and was told they think I am an asshole for getting involved with his family situation. I tried to explain that I hadn't meant to pry and they told me I treated him unfairly and couldn't handle the situation which made me an asshole.

I’m really worried they are right. I just couldn’t keep making excuses anymore.

She is a week old. 


My brother and I have a solid relationship, but we recently had a falling out because he said I overstepped boundaries that were never clear to me. To be honest, I don’t really like his gf, but I don’t show it. His gf recently moved in a week after I did, and once she arrived, he said that we could still be close, but that his priorities would shift. He said he would be focusing on his child. I respected that, and once she got here I began doing things we used to do, I would go into the room when they were in thee, ask to play video games and offer to clean his room. Apparently, this annoyed his gf and she wondered why I wanted to clean his room since she was here and could clean it, then accused me of acting “funny” because she was here. 

This caused my brother and I to have a falling out, we recently patched things up but once he brought the baby back, he began talking to me less. This bothered me, and when I tried talking to him, he brushed me off.  This morning they had a doctors appointment, however I had excruciating pain in my ankles that I sprained by falling and he had to rush me to the hospital. 

Both my brother and family accused me of being attention seeking, saying that I can’t stand to not be the center of attention, I explained that I didn’t do anything wrong, and that it was a genuine emergency.

I (28F) asked Carly what she wanted to do and she claimed she told me she was going to bring our mom cake and flowers. I personally do not remember her saying that, what I do remember her saying is “well I get off work late and I would be there late since it’s around traffic hour.” I told Carly “I’ll probably still drop by moms still, I wanted to send her flowers but I’m broke so I’m not sure if I can get her something.” After that, it was the end of the conversation since my mom had told us she just wanted a simple birthday. 

Fast forward to my moms actual birthday, I decide to drop by my moms house with cake, flowers, and her fave chocolate. Again, I do not remember Carly saying she was going to bring my mom those items as well. After I dropped off my moms gifts, I get a text from Carly in our group chat saying “I got mom flowers and cake too, but from Costco.” This was then followed with another text from Carly saying I stole her idea of bringing mom cake and flowers. If it makes any difference, I got my moms gifts from a more ""higher end"" grocery store called Market of Choice that was down the street from where I live. Again, I have no recollection of Carly saying this and did not accuse her of not saying that so I did not bring cake and flowers out of spite. 

Carly sends me more texts saying I stole her idea and I “lied” about being “too broke.” I told her I probably said that but it  does not mean I still can’t bring my mom gifts on her birthday. I told her that it’s great mom got gifts from her kids on her birthday, so what’s the real issue? Carly responds and says it’s not worth trying to talk to me because talking to me gets nowhere, but in actuality its the other way around. This is when I stopped responding because this is not the first time Carly has gotten upset over something so small. How I see this is that Carly is upset she was not the only one who brought my mom cake and flowers for her birthday, seriously, it's over OUR MOMS birthday. 

Something to note is that Carly has been my bully since childhood so to my memory/experience, I have always had an issue with how she treats me. My mom knows the history obviously, I remember when I was 13, I told my mom I NEVER want Carly to meet my kids or be in their life because of how Carly treats me. I have C-PTSD, so you could also probably say Carly is a trigger for me so I do not know what reasons I give her to treat me the day she does. I have tried to talk to Carly about my C-PTSD and she dismissed it, because I should be able to ""get over it."" In my opinion, Carly has anger and control issues, I've said this to her and she denies it even though it's extremely obvious. Its been made more obvious to other people in our immediate family in recent years and trying to get her to be accountable/reasonable is impossible.

Then when we were nearing the end he actually went around and took the woman’s empty boxes and said he’d take them back to the dumpster and she thanked him and he said “we like to do what we can to help around here” and I asked if I could throw some of my empty garbage bags into the empty boxes he was carrying and he actually said “no” and walked to the back and threw out her trash. Then at the end I asked if I could use some of their hand sanitizer since I was touching a bunch of used bottles and he said “no” again (even though I saw him give some to the guy in front of me). The woman actually kept looking at me like she also didn’t think it was right.

I was really upset when I left because I had no idea why he singled me out and treated me so much differently. I’m white so it probably wasn’t a race thing, but I am autistic and can carry myself kinda weird sometimes so that’s the only thing I can think of. When I got home, I wrote a Google review of the center and told my experience and also said I didn’t know why he singled me out. It’s also gotten five “helpful” votes in the time it’s been up.

This morning I went back and there was a guy I’d never seen before who introduced himself as the manager and I asked about the manager who used to be there, and he told me corporate fired him because of “complaints.”

Now I’m wondering…could this be my fault? I of course didn’t mean to get him fired and he was acting like a jerk. I also really like advocating for myself, but maybe that wasn’t the best hill to die on.

Ever since I was a little girl, I have been trying to impress my grandmother, but I feel like nothing I do makes her happy. I always feel like I am living in the shadow of my older sister who my grandmother considers to be perfect.

My grandmother tries very hard to make sure everything is perfect, but sometimes that puts strain on the family. Maybe it is because she is from a different generation and she has had a very hard past, but she doesn't like to speak about it.

Recently I had enough of her looking down on me, so we had a very big argument. Harsh words were said, such as me saying to her that she is destroying the family. There was also property damage in the house too.

Afterwards, I have always been super picky over what restaurants we go to. I always choose which restaurants we go to, because I am quite picky with food and my partner is not. But all the places I pick, are all fancy restaurants which accomodate any tastes. HE is a huge fan of most of the restaurants since before he event met me. So he always has 30+ meals to choose from. Because I choose the place, I 100% willingly pay for both mine and his food (as I feel like it's an obligation, I did choose the restaurant after all) and I have never complained about it. I do it out of my own pocket so it costs me a lot.

I thought our arrangement was going quite well until he lashed out on me, writing me a huge essay about how much I complain &amp; are picky so he has no idea what to do with me.

It was great for both of us. But when it was time for my period, he started freaking out. He constantly asked me if I was feeling any cramps or had any of the symptoms i normally felt. I was honest with him and told him not. He would keep freaking out. And when my period was delayed by a couple of days he forced me to speak to my doctor. The reason I wasn't freaking out was because i know how my body works and sometimes the cycle can be delayed. 

This was the first time it happened. The next month, it was the same. He would constantly ask me. It was literally the only thing we would speak about. The second month my period was on time so things weren't so bad. 

Couple of months months went by and my period was delayed again and i knew it was because of all the work stress i was facing. I kept telling him this but he continued to pester me and at first i was patient and reassured him that everything was alright. But he kept calling me all the time just to check if i had felt any symptoms! In fact, we got into a bit of a fight. But my period came and things were ok again. 

Once again, a few months went by and everything was fine. But again my period was delayed. And this time, i knew the reason! I was traveling, my sleep cycle was all over the place and i was extremely stressed. Since i was expecting this to happen, i had warned him beforehand. 

However, when my period date rolled around, he started panicking again. He called and messaged all the time, just checking only about my period. This time my period was delayed by 8 days and even though I knew the reasons, i was also a little worried (not that i was pregnant because we always use protection) if everything was fine. 

While I was worried, traveling and under all this stress, my boyfriend continued to pester me and after a while and a lot of cyclical conversations that ended with me reassuring him,, i lost my patience and told him that if he asked me again, i would just not respond. He still didn't get it. He kept at it and we got into a huge fight where he (for the first time) used abusive language at me! I was taken aback and sort of distanced myself from him. 

When i got my period, he apologized for everything and expected everything to go back to normal. I told him i was done having sex with him and couldn't go through all this every month or every time my period was a little delayed. 

He told me he only freaks out because I'm against abortion (for myself. No judgement or advice for anyone else! Strongly believe we are all entitled to make decisions about our bodies) and that if i change my mind about it and agree to get an abortion in case of an accidental pregnancy, he wouldn't freak out so much.

So, i 26(M) and my brother 30(M) never had a good relationship. It start pretty much the day of my birth when according to my mother his first word to the classical "" you are a big brother now "" where "" Well you didn't ask for my opinion "" ... yeah very good start bro ! 

We are, and always have been the exact opposite. he was good at school , i had difficulties. He was into sport, i was a nerd. He was popular, i was bullied ect ect 


When i was bullied at school for years he was not here for me 
When our grandfather ( an alcholic racist cunt btw) would openly say he prefer him over me and calling me names he never say a word to defend me 
When his own friend where bullying me and made my holydays a nightmare he would laugh with them 
And when we were alone he was bullying me 
Not every day of course and somone could tell it was just ""brother stuff"" but i can't remember à single time where i was that mean to him.

 He mocked the books i loved. Even reading the romance part with a moking voice 
The movies i love where stupid and dumb ( he say that about cloud atlas …)
I was useless,  can't take a joke,  he knew better than me even on subject i know he know shit ect ect 

Long story short two year ago it explode. What start over a joke finish in me yelling at him that he was the last fucking person who i would take advice from. That i always hated the way him and his dumbass friends treat me  that he was the worst brother a kid in my position could expect ect ect 
In tears i tell him that i was a kid in desperate need of someone To trust and to protect me. I was in need of a brother and he was nowhere To be found or on the side of my bullies

Our mother is sad about this situation and try To make us talk. It work one time and we talk...
He didn't excuse for anything,  it was ""jokes"" ""not that bad"" "" à long time ago"" and even that I should excuse myself To him and mom to hold such a grudge. 
I made it very clear that i would NEVER apologise for being bullied and he can go fuck himself

Now the situation is basicly the same except i got à call from or mother. He his going To have a baby. And she hope i could be a good uncle and help him with the kid. like taking him for hollydays, babysit when i can ect ect 
Basicly helping him when he is in need.
She say i need to forgive and move along and my nephew is a good oportunity for me and my brother to reconect 
I clearly say no. I will not help him in any way or form. 
I was call heartless, egoist and many other name of course. 

But i still Feel bad. Even if i don't like kids and don't want one, i can't deny my nephew a good relationship with his very cool uncle ( especialy when his dad is boring has fuck)
But i would prefer cutting my own finger than To help him. 

So, AITA by not wanting To forgive my brother and making the risk of not knowing my nephew ?

She died 8 months later. The 8 months before her death she begged dad to do some stuff without his wife and stepdaughter and give her some memories of us together with our mom and him. He agreed. His stepdaughter was 6 at the time and knew us most of her life so I know she was confused when she no longer saw my sister at all and then was told she died. Not to mention why the man she called dad was gone so much. My dad wanted my sister to let his wife and stepdaughter be at her bedside with the rest of the family but she said they weren't her family and refused. She died with me, mom, dad and our grandparents at her side. 

Right after my sister died my dad and I had a huge falling out. He wanted me to move in with him and he wanted me to shower his stepdaughter with the same love I showered my sister with. He told me I needed to be her big brother for real now because it was going to be a lot for her. I told him I would never feel the same for her as I did my sister and I did not want to pretend I cared about her at that time. He told me I owed them all (he included his wife in that) because I was the last sibling left and needed to make up for my sister shutting stepsister out at the end of her life. Dad and I did not talk after our argument until he reached out three months ago.

It started with him wanting to know how I was doing but then he told me how his stepdaughter missed me and my sister and how she'd struggled with not saying goodbye to ""her sister"" and why she didn't get to see her before she died, why she had nothing of hers to hold onto. How she asked a lot about why I wasn't around anymore. He asked me to talk to her and tell her that my sister had wanted to see her and to help her believe that she was loved and wanted by her and that my sister asked for her a lot at the end. I told him I would not lie for him. He snapped at me and said I owed her this much when I abandoned her just like my sister had for no other reason than she wasn't our bio sister and wasn't enough for us to love. He told me I should be a better man than that.

We lost our boy cat a few months ago. It was bad, very bad, he was my partners buddy. It also shocked and devastated me.

My partner believes in reincarnation and wanted to try and find his buddy reincarnated as a kitten. (Specifics not important other than a certain timeline where reincarnation takes place).

It took me weeks to find litters that would fit the timeline. I did all the research and showed pictures and any health info. It took him a week to let me know he was interested in a boy from this one litter and could I ask the owner to visit.

So we go to visit, I have terrible driving anxiety due to an accident years ago. Partner does not drive very far to anywhere. But I managed to get us there 1.5 hours each way.

We get to see the litter but one of the kittens had been misidentified as male but was a female. But there was a newer litter that had two males so the owner brought them as well as the girl. I was so happy to see them. 

I could instantly tell my partner was moody because the younger kittens were too young to really make a connection with. I felt like he wasn't cuddling them, was holding them out trying to make a connection so they were meowing like crazy cuz yeah.

Owner tells us not to worry we are welcome to come back in a couple of weeks and she would hold the boys for us until we could make a decision. I thought that was very nice.

Well it seemed like the end of the world to my partner, barely spoke to me on the way home. Once we got home the mood worsened and he just kept going on about what a waste it all was and now we would have to go back again. I tried to be reassuring saying I didn't mind driving and we barely used any gas.

He accused me of not caring and not offering sympathy, not understanding his feelings and it wasn't about the gas, it was about his anxiety about leaving the house. I tried to soothe saying that it had gone ok, nothing bad had happened we were safe and back home with no issues.

Long story short he just went after me about not understanding that I was arguing etc. The trip was very stressful for me and I had done all the work to get there. The only reason I'd done any of it was to help him feel better. And all that happened was him being even more unhappy. I asked him what was really important about this entire situation. He said ""MY Feelings!"" Then I felt like if that's all that was important we shouldn't get the cat because to me the cats life is what's really important. So I said ""Then we aren't getting the cat"". He then said that I was mean and a butthole.

Did I go too far, AITA? I was very frustrated, I had a long day as well and all I wanted was for him to be happy and feeling excited about having a new buddy, but it was just this outpouring of negativity and idk what.

Especially the ones that cost money. What they would do, is my parents would say, “yes we’ll pay for the payment ($5-10 dollars) for you!” Because I was like 12 and couldn’t work. They would keep telling me that they’ll pay the amount. Then the day comes when they have to pay. They ignore me the whole day and then say they don’t have the money after the due date. This has been my whole life. I am now a freshman college student and I’d say I’m very independent. I pay my bills and I got my own phone so they don’t have to use my phone as a bargaining tool (saying they’ll turn it off). But then a bill that I needed to pay for one of my “extracurriculars” (I don’t want to go into detail because I’m trying to stay anonymous ish) came unexpectedly (I joined later than others and didn’t know about the bill.) I asked specifically my mother to help pay and she said she would. We had a deep conversation about how this opportunity can change my life and teach me so much. She told me she was proud I got into the extracurricular. I asked every day for the money and she always brushed it off but said she’ll give the money. Now looking back I should’ve known. The day came for the due date and she ignored me. They pushed back the due time for me and she still ignored my messages. Then the second due date comes in and of course I couldn’t stay because of the due date. This is where i could be the asshole. I privately messaged her a HUGE paragraph basically saying “you broke your promise and my trust. I don’t want to come up for Christmas and I don’t even want to look at you. Im done with the lies and this hurt my career.”

We were seeing each other for around three months when he invited me to meet his parents which I was totally up for as he’d met mine and they really liked him. When I arrived at his house that evening I didn’t expect to face what I did. When entering the living room I saw his mother in a hospital bed it turned out that she was unable to feel anything from the neck down and was confined to a wheelchair or hospital bed if she was unwell. The reason I hadn’t been expecting this was because my boyfriend didn’t tell me anything. I was visibly shocked and I just felt like I needed some kind of warning before walking in there but I wasn’t given that opportunity.

When I asked him why he hadn’t told me he said it was not something he liked to discuss and that I should leave it. And I did leave it because I didn’t want to upset him. When he gets upset he drinks and can be quite insulting. I guess I just didn’t want to argue with him.

So about two weeks ago we were sitting in my living room watching a movie when he told me that he needed to be home by 6 pm to cook his mother’s dinner which I said was fine whatever he needed to do. We continued watching the movie and when I next looked at the clock it was now five past 6. So I brought up that he said he needed to be home by 6 pm for his mother. It was at this point that he flipped out at me. Screaming that I had no idea what he went through every day and that I shouldn’t involve myself in his family business. I told him I wasn’t trying to involve myself I was just reminding him of what he said about going home to cook his mother's dinner. He kept yelling at me and it attracted the attention of my parents who were upstairs. I decided that before my father kicked him out I should tell him to leave but he wouldn’t.

Long story short he did leave once my dad entered the room but once he left I was then sat down by my parents who said that I needed to break up with him as he has a lot of issues and that they were worried about what this was doing to me. I agreed and broke up with him via text as I wasn’t sure how he would react in person.

Since then a lot of our mutual friends have stopped speaking with me. I asked one of the only ones who was still talking to me what I had done to offend them and was told they think I am an asshole for getting involved with his family situation and then breaking up with him because of it. I tried to explain that I hadn't meant to pry on his situation and that it wasn't the reason I ended things with him but they said at the end of it it boiled down to I couldn't handle the situation and it made me an asshole.

I’m really worried they are right. I didn’t want to end things with him but I just couldn’t keep making excuses anymore.

I typically get 4 appointments per shift, and these appointments are non-emergency, for animals.
Today I have a shift at my work naturally, but my throat has been getting quite bad and I've been feeling sore, so I called into work over the phone with my manager with many hours notice. We have a small team and apparently the other two options that could cover my shift are also sick, it happens. The team didn't tell me they got coverage and didn't say they cancelled my appointments (which is easy and has been done before for sick peope) so I made the mistake of telling them that I could come in if there was nothing that could be done, I'd just lack my typical performance and speed and inwas convered about getting my two pregnant coworkers sick (I'd mask up but still). I started feeling much worse, so I messaged our group chat and asked if everyone possible was called for coverage, and I got what feels like a snarky answer, and before I could respond back with an ""ok see you later"" I got a ""don't bother coming in.""
This upset me a lot, there are two main positions of my job, and I am at the ""lesser position"" (which is terrible to say) and I keep having instances where I feel lesser and belittled. They stopped happening for a bit, but this message in the group chat felt really bad. I know I shouldn't have told them I could come in if nothing could be done, but this came off really rude, and from someone who has zero authority over me. The person is capable of canceling my appointments and despite being in the ""higher"" position, she is not my boss by any means whatsoever.
I really love my job, but I keep having these interactions where I'm feeling disrespected and it makes me want to leave and just apprentice elsewhere.
I do have the original texts but I don't want to post them for privacy, but this is exactly copy-pasted. This is the same coworker the entire time, but in a GC. This coworker can be crass in terms of sensitivity, most people in our work environment wonder if they did something wrong to get the interactions they do from this particular person, but I figure they're just not super social at work and that's OK but this hurts a bit.

I think I might be TA for saying I could still come in and then asked if we had used all possibilities for me to avoid coming in...but also I just sort of feel like this could have been handled nicer. But I'm also ND and can be a bit more sensitive. I worry about what people think of me a lot.

So this is a very long story (ill try shorten) and happened a quite a long time ago but still to this day it still continues.

I have a hard time remembering how i met Jason but it was some way online, bonding over living in the same country and similar interests. We where friends for a long time, for around 2 years still fighting alot, very petty things as we where both minors at the time. Long story short, we eventually created a friend group and all talked and bonding with each other. One day i went on call and found them all giggling and telling everyone not to say something to me, i was confused and pushed one of the people to say something and eventually found out they where ""catfishing people for fun"" on a online dating game, Jason was very young so i was concerned but for the sake of trying to see how worried i should be i kept quiet and joined them.
Found out Jason had a ""girlfriend"" who was MUCH older then him, for explanation he was around 12 and the girl was 16, i was disgusted but found out he was saying he was 17 to her. So i obviously didnt let that slide, said i had to go and talked to the girl. I explained everything and she thanked me. 
To skip some details, one of the other boys lets call Jeremy kept telling me he was on my side and completelt agreed with me until i got onto the call and they shouted and insulted me, and i in return laughed and left the call (despite aggressively shaking). I blocked all of them until me and jason had another incident but i cannot share as it is VERY much agaisnt the rules. 😅 

For years now, he has constantly tried contacting me through every social media he could get into contact with. Ive blocked him on everything.

We were sitting in a hotel room where he said “do you wanna marry me” and pulled out the box. He didn’t even get on one knee. The ring is okay. It’s a bit big and is not my style at all. I told him I wanted a lab grown diamond because of ethical reasons but I don’t think it’s lab grown or an heirloom diamond. I’m a romantic and I’ve told him how important it is for me to get a traditional proposal.

My fiance has a bad habit of comparing me to his exes in both good and bad ways. His last ex was apparently a career woman who always looked perfect and blah blah blah. We got into a fight when he told me this stuff because if he wanted her so bad why did he dump her? Why get with me? 

This weekend we were hanging out with our friends when my fiance’s ex came up in conversation. She went to princeton and he brought up I’m still in community college and about to transfer to state school. I was furious that he was comparing us again so I said, “yeah she does get the best right? Her husband got her a (really expensive recognizable ring that costs $15k) for her engagement” and I pulled up her instagram to show “and I got this thing”.

My whole family is really close and tried really hard to get to know x. But she is a classic narcissist, we were always “mean to her” and “never tried to get to know her”. Neither of which is true. 
We all tried very hard to get to know her and form a relationship with x. Every time we tried we would get in trouble because we triggered her or made her feel unwelcome. We invited them over for dinner, made plans to go on camping trips etc, all in an attempt to show that we really did care and wanted to get to know her. 
She posted things on fb about depression and anxiety. We said ok, how can we help? what are your triggers? she said to google it. 
(I also have serious problems with depression and have told my family my triggers and they have respected them.)
We kept trying but it got to the point where she was lying about things said and done all while my parents were financially supporting them.
After being called an acquaintance, a horrible person, saying incredibly bad things about all of us as a family, parents pulled financial support. (He hung on months longer than he should have). She then blamed my parents for trying to financially manipulate them and that there were going nc for 6 months. 
During this whole process a said “I support everything she says.” Even when she told my dad and brother that they were despicable human beings and that we had all gaslit our community, family and friends into thinking we were good people. (I would write down more of the bs that she said but there isnt enough space.)
This Aug another brother got married. We found out that weekend that a had been separated/divorced since Feb of this yr.
My parents reached out at that time and a said that he blamed everything on us and that he didn’t care about us and that any relationship we had is gone now. And will never come back.
Since then he has gone to some therapy and now my mom and dad have been able to talk to him and spend time with him. They are welcoming him back with open arms, which is fine. 
The problem is that they now want me to do the same. I don’t want to. 
I have some issues from a past relationship, ie, if someone close to me hurts me that relationship is basically nonexistent and needs to be rebuilt. I have told both of my parents that I am willing to talk to him. But unless he shows that he is a different person that who is was with x, I don’t want anything to do with him.

Todays argument focused on COVID vaccines and healthcare in general. This topic is something I am very close to as I am a registered nurse, and currently work in a city hospital as a case manager. I was telling my family that a nurse I was on a unit with was going around talking about common vaccine stereotypes and basing all of their evidence anecdotally, and how this is problematic as patients may see a healthcare provider like a nurse as a reliable source of information and base health decisions off of who they perceive to have the higher medical literacy in the room. 

I was then berated for being overweight and someone who uses nicotine for implying I advocate for my patients to have a healthy lifestyle. I was called a hypocrite and said that since I can’t prove the vaccine won’t have any negative effects on the patients twenty years from now I may be responsible for killing them if they have an “adverse reaction”.

At this point I’m seething.. I basically told my family they’re fucking idiots and have no authority to make these claims, and are being assholes. To which usually ends the conversation and makes it so I have to apologize for losing my cool. They often say things like “oh you’re so much smarter than us” because I’m the only one in my immediate family with a degree even if it’s just an associates (finishing my bachelors now).

We have a strict policy.”My daughter began crying and was told, “Well, you can come for this ONE meeting since you’re here and prepared.” My daughter said she was already crying, felt embarrassed and wanted to go home.

A bunch of ladies she is friends with who all take turns hosting the book club event.  They choose a book &amp; get together to discuss it &amp; how they related to it.  Although the book is the primary topic, its really an excuse for them to get together, socialize, eat/drink/smoke &amp; hang out.  I think its a nice thing they have going on.  Im not a member of the book club, its girl's only but Im considered an *honorary member* &amp; I know most of the ladies there personally.

The issue arose when my wife hosted the group at our house.  I was home, not participating but could overhear their convos about what book they should read next.  I piped up &amp; mentioned *The Godfather*.  Some of the ladies are Italian descent so I felt that resonated with their background.  Most people enjoyed the movie (undoubtedly a household name); why I read the book.  The ladies discussed the movie a bit &amp; then agreed to make that their next book for the upcoming get together.

My wife attended the next hosting &amp; reported some ladies were offended by the writing.  For those who havent read the book, its rife with misogynism, racism, criminal activity, murder etc...  All topics they took offense to.  ""Well yeah, they saw the film about a family's interactions with the mafia.  What did they expect a book written before political correctness to be about?""  She recognized the offensive themes in the book but read with an open mind &amp; was cognizant of the era the book portrayed (as did some of the other ladies present).

My wife thought I did nothing wrong but she received flak from some ladies (not all) bc the book was more offensive than the film.  I agree with this; the film toned down these elements.  The ladies are feminist leaning, ""woke"" etc... &amp; were pissed.  Reading hundreds of pages was enough punishment but then meeting to discuss the ""rampant machismo"" was too much.  Wife was uncomfortable; they didnt outright criticize her husband to her but the book was not as enjoyed as other titles.

I countered they read other books with similar shocking/undesirable topics that were well accepted so I had no misgivings about recommending *The Godfather*.  E.g. *Uncle Tom's Cabin* was eagerly discussed yet is rife with racism, n-word galore &amp; abusive treatment of slaves.  Among other books with clearly adult/uncomfortable themes.  I said your group isnt reading children's stories so I dont see what I did wrong &amp; they shouldnt be mad at me.  My wife agrees the group's reaction was unpredictable.

Its a book they (enthusiastically) agreed to read which they could have put it down at any time.

One morning, when I got up a bit late (not past my start time fortunately) my mom left a note asking if I could switch over the laundry. Had I known in advance, I would have gotten up sooner to take care of that, but now I had to figure out when and how to take care of this without falling behind on my work, a bit trickier given I was learning a new workflow that was reducing my task efficiency lately.

Later, I texted her back saying I did that, but for future reference, to please not ask me to do things like that during my workday; that just because I'm at the house, doesn't mean I'm ""home."" The way the note was written, it suggested to me that she thought it wouldn't be a problem for me to do while working, but she explained then that she didn't intend to leave it for me to do, that the washer wasn't finished before she had to go to work herself.

If my stepdad's home (usually he's working while I am, but on a rare occasion he'll have the day off), he's usually on the couch in the living room between my room and the kitchen, and he'll often ask me for a small favor when I pass by, like grabbing him a beer, putting food he got delivered into the fridge, or bringing in the mail (front door is also between my room and the kitchen). This isn't usually a problem, but when he did this one day while I was working -- on occasion during my workday, between tasks, I'll take a quick walk to the kitchen just to refill my water bottle -- after work, I politely asked that he doesn't ask me to do favors like that while I'm on the clock, that I wasn't upset that he asked, and that I didn't want to make a big deal about it. He seemed frustrated that I would seemingly make such a big deal over a quick task, but said he wouldn't. And then later that week or next week (just yesterday) he asked me to both bring him two water bottles and put his food in the fridge during one such water-bottle-refilling trip. This really upset me considering we'd -just- talked about this, but I didn't want to anger him again, especially not while I'm working.

It's not that I'm unwilling to help them out in general, but I really don't want my work efficiency to be hindered by other people asking me to do things as well, just because I happen to be working from home. You don't see me asking them to do me favors while they're off working, right? Is it unfair for me to request the same treatment while I'm working, even if the location at which I work happens to be at the house? It sounds like my mom understands, but my stepdad, given what just happened yesterday, still doesn't think it's a big deal to ask me to do these things while I'm working.

I told my girlfriend about the fact that they were trying to kill us and she thought I was just really drunk and she drove me home. 

But I guess she had also been suspicious or weirded out and she had been googling my name. She found an article from my university saying that I was expelled and the whole incident and she asked me what it was about and why I never told her since I had just told her I had no interest in university. I didn’t want to tell her since I felt like that person wasn’t me anymore and it wasn’t relevant.

But I told her everything. And she was really upset that I didn’t tell her sooner. She said that it was a huge burden for her especially since I didn’t tell her when we first met and she hadn’t been returning any of my calls.

I had an old best friend, we’ll call her ally, who used to bring her friend around sometimes to hangouts and parties when I was in college a couple years ago. Let’s call the friend Ella.   Ally and Ella were pretty good friends not super close but ally and myself were close. Me and Ella  would occasionally flirt and we always felt like we vibed but ally never really helped me or Ella make it happen. 

Anyways, ally and Ella are getting ready to move to Arizona together but then ally backs out because she claims ella didn’t disclose full information about how rent would work since ally was staying at Ella’s  brothers house with Ella while they would attend school out there. 
Ally tells me along with other friends, and as normal friends would, we back her up and tell her to make the decision she feels is best. Ally ends up staying and ella ends up leaving and their friendship is ended with a big falling out. Ally also spreads a lot of bad things about ella to their friend group so ella now has no more friend group. 

Anyways, life continues. I graduated so I don’t really see ally as much as we used to and even tho I’d reach out to hang the friendship wasn’t the same as it used to be in college. 6 months go by from the Ally and ella falling out situation. Ella ends up back in our city and we end up reconnecting. We hit it off but obviously we both know the difficult situation with Ally. After a couple hangouts it begins to bother me so I decide to tell Ally that I’ve seen ella a couple times and we have been vibing. 
Ally doesn’t take it well. Cursing me out and essentially says our friendships is dead. I tried to continue to be her friend but she was having none of it. Me and Ella continue to see each other and begin dating. 6 months later Ally reaches out to me trying to become friends again. When I tried being friendly when I first told Ally about Ella, Ella was supportive and hoped me and Ally would work it out. Now 6 months later Ally is trying to reconcile but Ella isn’t okay with it anymore. (Fair enough)

My main question is, was this situation handled the best way? Was I allowed to be with someone I thought was always cool. Am I in the wrong? At times I think about the situation because it was a sad ending to a friendship. 

Ps. When me and my older ex broke up, Ally became best friends with my ex right after we broke up and I wasn’t happy about it but still continued our friendship at that time.

It was going great until she had made some other friends and she would tell all my private secrets to them. She would show them my embarrassing pictures and would tell them shit about me. I soon found this out and asked what was up. She said they are her friends and that they wouldn’t tell anyone even though those girls would skinny shame and call me ugly every single day. She would still call, text and hang out with me but she had changed and she was acting like a bitch. I remember when there was a rumour my boy best friend liked me and I had a small crush on him too, she told the entire school we were dating but we weren’t. It was honestly the worst year of my life. She would also make fun of the fact my cat had died. It wasn’t a good time to make jokes about it.

English is not my first language.

My (31F) parents (64M and 61F) are both retired and comfortable financially. I adopted their saving habits and am on my way to financial freedom and an early retirement with a simple/minimalistic lifestyle. Sis (26F) is a bit unsettled as she switched her career recently that wiped out a huge chunk of her savings and our parents helped her out. It happens, I went through a crisis a few years ago and our parents helped me out too. I have since repaid whatever money they had given me.

Sis and I have always been very close, she is my best friend and greatest supporter while I am extremely protective of her. Few months ago she moved in with me due to a new job and I was also looking for a roommate. We split all household expenses like rent, utilities, groceries etc. While she tried to stay on track, she has fallen behind on some bills because she needs to maintain some emergency funds which is fair. I don't mind taking on the additional financial burden for as long as it takes for her to get on track. 

However, over time I have noticed that she is not prioritizing her savings. She’s planning trips with friends and BF, goes shopping with friends even when she doesn’t need any new stuff, orders take out almost 3-4 nights a week even though there's fresh food at home. It’s her money, but maybe it would be smarter to pay bills or save instead of these 'discretionary' spends as she often has buyer's remorse.

Our parents don’t seem to strongly suggest that she curb her spending either. They just help her out whenever she needs money and I feel it encourages this spending habit. I had once raised this issue with all of them and my sister got upset while my parents said that she was an adult and I should not be commenting on her finances.

Recently, I suggested a few investment/saving options to discourage the unnecessary spending. But she got upset again as she felt I was trying to bring it up because of the shared bills she has fallen behind on. She also revealed that she has always felt insecure as I seem to have ‘it all under control’ whereas she can never measure up to me and I felt guilty for raising this issue again. 

But I am still worried about her and am having a hard time keeping quiet while she keeps on making the same mistakes. The way the economy is headed, it'll become difficult for her to save and be financially independent in the future. I have some past trauma as I was financially abused by my ex despite being careful with my money and I have since learned to always be on top of money matters. I want Sis to be financially secure but I am unable to explain the gravity of the situation to her. 

So WIBTA if I again confront my sister and parents about her being careless with her money and that my parents are enabling this behavior? Or am I over-reacting and interfering in her business?

The tag is a little misleading but on Sunday my (M 32) wife’s (F 31) grandma died and she had been sick for awhile she cried for a bit and we talked. That day was one of those days with our son who is three. He seemed tired from jump street and would t nap so by the end of the night he was mad at us and told us he was gonna run away I told him to sit in timeout until we told him to get up he cried and my wife talked to him while I did the dishes in the kitchen we went upstairs and had a good night and he went to bed. I work night shift so I went to work that night and my wife texted me saying he had a dream waking up crying saying he didn’t wanna be here anymore cuz daddy doesn’t like him. Now I should point out since my son was born my anxiety has skyrocketed and I got really out of whack with the pandemic shutting down AA meetings. So 6 months ago I got back I. Therapy and working on my meds with a psychiatrist, and the last month I’ve been doing really well with my anxiety which manifests sounding angry. Anyway after my wife told me this I started to spiral into my old thinking that addict voice in my head telling me I was the same piece of shit I always was. I roughed it out at work trying not to cry when my son came downstairs to greet me when I got home I did my best to hold it together and went upstairs as I fell asleep I felt so low I was feeling g like I don’t want to wake up again. One of the big things I’m working on I. Therapy is communicating my thoughts so I’m not in them alone. So I went through my day and played sickly sweet stepford wife type voice. After I put my son to bed I came up to my wife and I broke down told her everything o was feeling I sobbed and cried about how I was haunting his dreams the person I love most and if that’s what I’m doing to him I should leave cuz I’m hurting him. Ever since that happened she’s been totally off with me and I’m regretting telling her. I finally asked her what was wrong and she said she’s mad cuz her grandma died and she didn’t get a chance to grieve cuz she has to worry about me. I apologized I never meant to do that but idk what I could’ve done differently I didn’t ask for a breakdown so AITA and if I am what can I do different I love my wife and would never want her to feel this way",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4850353,public,,self,AITA for having a full breakdown the day after my wife’s grandma died,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbmmos/aita_for_having_a_full_breakdown_the_day_after_my/,all_ads,6,,,,

I asked my cousin how much it would cost me for him to watch my kid the rest of the day.

He said $500, which I thought was fair. I said ""cash or check?"" He looked surprised that I agreed and then accepted the check and my kid. I got to ride all the rides I'd been wanting to ride.

My aunt found out about this on the way back and was mad. My cousin's sisters were upset that they didn't get $500 and he did. My aunt asked why I only made the offer to him and not them. I said that I wasn't made of money and couldn't afford to pay three kids when I only needed one babysitter. Besides, his sisters are too young to babysit at such a public venue.

But my aunt was still mad and tattled on me to my husband, who is now giving me the silent treatment for not spending the whole day with our son.
