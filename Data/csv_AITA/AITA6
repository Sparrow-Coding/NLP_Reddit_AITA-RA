now,  to preface her reaction to that: I work as a SEASONAL receiver that has  incoming trucks every Monday and Wednesday, I work full time, standing  all hours on a concrete floor. I used to work ALL 40 hours. until  another person in my department would regularly not show up (or call-in)  2/5ths of his work week and be protected by higher management. So I  thought it'd be okay- if after lifting all the couches in our department  store that I get to relax and take one day off every two weeks. Also,  this last Friday was our first snow of the year, and my car was 4 inches  deep in snow with bald tires, while I was at the end of my work week,  so I called out.

In response, my mother immediately goes into a tirade about how I'm not fit to be an  adult, how I'm ruining my future, how everyone was depending on me to be there, how I am going to be fired, and that I am a failure for not  being able to afford proper healthcare. Then, the straw that breaks the  camel's back is that she says, ""You know, I don't believe that  you were (insert bad childhood thing) by (your biological father), in fact, if anyone did \*blank\* you, it was me because you deserved it, and you know what el-"" I  cut the line.

the first 8 years of my life are embroiled in awful memories, that never did stop, only got mixed in with good memories too. I try very hard to hide the fact that anything happened to me in my  day-to-day life. So much so, my girlfriend didn't know for a year (out  of five now), that I didn't tell my therapist friend for 2 years, and I  didn't tell my mom until 3 months ago, mostly  because I knew she would eventually belittle my experiences when she saw  fit, as she has done dozens of times before this point in my life.

Beyond  this, the reason she wouldn't know about it, is because she was absent  for more than over 6 years of my early childhood (0-12) due to her  (volunteering for) deployment and ignoring my pleas when she would come  home, all to which she would ignore them.

(the only reason I feel so  safe in saying all of this here is because I don't equate myself much to  being a person online or even being myself, just some sort of amorphous  being looking for attention and answers.)

So,  at that point, in modern day, I hung up on my mother, and it was shitty  of her and me, but I decided not to do anything... later that night my  step-father texts me with a  ""would you like this camera?"" which makes  me feel like I'm being bribed with a 100$ camera. Then, just in the last  2 hours before writing this, he sends a ""you really need to apologize to your mother."" and I get sent into a spiral all over again because  apparently I AM the asshole.-

but I would like to know...

I'm convinced that I am NOT the bad guy but my girlfriend (26F) of 3 years seems to believe otherwise. My girlfriend, who we will call 'E' is quite literally insane. E is extremely protective, almost too protective to the point where she seems insecure.

To set the scene, my family has a weekly dinner every Thursday evening. My mother, who is widowed, invites myself, E, my sister - who we will call 'L' (21F). 

Last week, Thursday came. Remember how I mentioned that E is kind of over protective and insecure? She is, so much to the point where she is jealous of my relationship with my sister, L. L and I have always been close, we are similar ages. After the passing of our father, we have only grown closer, especially because L finds comfort in me. E despises this, she believes the relationship my sister and I have is ""weird"".

L and I were making a few jokes at the table, and making inside jokes that E is not apart of. E often tells me that she is uncomfortable with L and I. Later on, E grew more irritated. At one point, L asked me to help her get dessert, to which I agreed. Upon our return,  E had abandoned me at my Mom's. L, who did not want me to get into further shit with E, offered to let me to stay at hers. I agreed, because I didn't feel like arguing with E. 

I returned to E and I's flat the next day, and she barely spoke. She seemed on edge, and only mentioned that she ""took care of the cats for me"" and to ""not bother feeding them"". I thought nothing of this, as E often feeds my cats, Mochi and Duck. Later, E was still pretty on edge, so we ate dinner separately. I had not seen the cats all day, and when I mentioned this to E, she said that ""they were probably hiding"" I thought this was odd, as both cats are social.

The following morning, there was still no sign of my cats. It should be noted that both cats are inside cats and rarely go outside. At work, I received a distressed call from my neighbour, who was trying to tell me that I needed to rush home. When I got home, I met my her,  to discover both of my cats dead on the side of the road. 

Devastated, I went  home, to confront E and ask her why she hadn't rang me about the cats as she was working from home that day. She burst. E told me that she had let the cats out Thursday night because she was upset by L and I. I asked her what the fuck she meant, and she told me that ""she knew about our relationship"" I tried to reason with her, because she has no siblings, but she was insistent that I was disgusting and that L and I had 'more' than a normal sibling relationship. Our argument continued for what felt like hours and, in the end, I decided to pack my shit and leave, because I just couldn't live with a cat killing monster like herself. 

I am currently crashing at L's and wondering what the fuck I do about my insane now ex-girlfriend, and my dead cats.

I recently had a birthday. The only thing I’d asked my husband for was a day break from our kids. He had agreed to taking them out on my birthday to give me a break. 

The day of my birthday he kept asking if I’d be okay if he decided to schedule a job that day. I told him I’d rather he didn’t with it being my birthday and the day I was supposed to have my much needed break. He said okay so I thought that was that. 

Then an hour later he said he had two jobs scheduled for that day and he needed to leave in 30 minutes. So I didn’t get my break on my birthday. 

He did tell me he’d make up for it this past Friday by taking the kids out all day. 

Friday comes and he decides to schedule two more jobs so I still don’t get my break. The plan turned into today, Tuesday. He had a ‘last minute emergency job’ come up today and couldn’t give me my break. 

He didn’t work any other day last week. Only on the days he had promised me. 

I told him this has really upset me because I really needed a break- and still do- and that was the only thing I asked for for my birthday. He told me I’m being ungrateful because he got me flowers on my birthday and he didn’t have to do that and he’ll give me my break this week.

I am the middle child in our family. Fake names have been used.

My younger sister, “Amy”, has recently had a knee injury, and on vacation, our parents brought a wheelchair to go sightseeing. We have been travelling in Disabled areas due to her wheelchair. Amy and my other sister, Abigail, have constantly been making jokes about how Amy is handicapped, crippled, “a cripple”, disabled, and things similar to that category. Outside of this injury, Amy is able-bodied and fit. I mentioned to them one day that calling her a “cripple” is insensitive to those who have real disabilities, seeing as many disabled people see it as very offensive, sometimes even a slur. However, they called me a “social justice warrior” and laughed at me. I tried to ignore them, but one day, we visited a busy area. In an attempt to use Amy to skip the line, my parents wheeled her up to the security guards, explained that she was in a wheelchair, and asked if there was any sort of special line for those in wheelchairs. However, while we were walking up to the security guards, Abigail leaned over to Amy and whispered, “Quick, act disabled!”, to which Amy half-closed one of her eyes, opened her mouth, and stuck out her tongue slightly, all while giggling. In my opinion, it was clear she was trying to mock disabled people. I was pretty annoyed, so I told them to knock it off and stop being disrespectful. They got mad at me, and Abigail asked me what my “problem” was. My parents, who overheard, told me that I was overreacting and being too sensitive.

(back story)

So last Wednesday I (15F) felt a pain in my neck then noticed that my lymph nodes were super swollen. (about the size of a quarter and kinda hard) So when my mom got home from work I told her and she felt them then told me that she would take me to the clinic the next day to get antibiotics for a virus she assumed I had.  (I feel I should point out that I don't have any other symptoms of being sick and I do school online and hardly leave the house but mask when I do)

 We go to the clinic the next day and the PA felt and said that the lymph nodes in my armpits and groin were extremely swollen too so they wanted to see if I had a virus. I tested negative to everything (Corona, Influenza A and B, Strep throat, mono, and others that I cannot remember.) so the PA told me that if by the Wednesday of this week they have not gotten any better to call the clinic and they will do an ultrasound and blood work, my mom and I say okay and we leave.  
I tried not to feel my neck because I didn't want to become more nervous but of course I have a couple of times throughout the week and they have become both a little larger and harder than they were when I first noticed them I told my mom and she told me to stop talking about it so I did but of course I'm worried I mean when I have I virus they normally become the size of a pea and are soft.

Anyways I'm rambling but to the point of this post  
It's Tuesday today and I was told by my mom that since it will be a little warmer out tomorrow that we will be going under the house when she gets off of work (half day due to the holiday) to fix something with the insulation. I said okay then asked her if when she got home from work she would call the clinic so we can set up a time to come in after the house stuff. She then snapped at me and said ""I'm not going to have a fucking $200 gas bill like last year"" I ended up crying because she always ends up procrastinating EVERYTHING until we end up missing it so I know that if she doesn't call that we wont end up going.  So I told her that she should care about my health for once and that this could be a LOT more serious than a simple virus like she thinks it is, after I said this I went to my room because if I argue I'm probably going to get yelled at so yeah here I am crying, cuddling with my dog, and writing this.

I don't think I'm being unreasonable here because she always thinks I'm overreacting and stuff when it comes to my health but I do feel bad because I know gas is getting more expensive and it will be a decent temperature out. I feel like I should apologize to her because I know the house stuff is important to do.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4816844,public,top,self,AITA For telling my mom that she should care more about my health right now than the gas bill?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2banj/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_she_should_care_more/,all_ads,6,,,,

I have nothing against quick unions, I know quite a few older adults who got married in a month and have had decades long marriages. However, we previously discussed getting married quickly was something neither of us desired. I did privately talk to her after her engagement announcement to make sure everything was ok and that she didn’t feel pressured or forced. She said she was happy. 

The wedding was beautiful, they looked wonderful together and the chapel they had it in was picture perfect. On the wedding day, a couple of mutual friends attended on R’s side and we all discussed that none of us had met the groom before. After the ceremony, photos were taken and I mentioned to some friends in front of R’s mother how everything got pulled together in such a short time and how generally impressed I was since wedding ceremonies usually take a while to plan, I also mentioned how she must be surprised at it all. There was no reception so we all caught up for a while longer outside of the church, mostly discussing non wedding topics 

So after the wedding I tell R, thanks for the invite and ask her if she’s well. She doesn’t respond for more than 2 and a half months. I try intermittently to message her, yet no reply. She usually is not a very punctual responder, normally it takes a couple of days for her to reply, but taking months is not usual behaviour. I’m obviously worried for her since she’s newly married to a guy I don’t know, nor do our mutual friends. I have anxiety and I spiral often, so of course in this situation I start to wonder if she feels she can’t reach out to us or if she’s not coping well, or if he’s controlling or worse.

Turns out, she was upset and thought me judgemental because of the words I said in front of her mother and mutual friends, and that she was keeping distance. Apparently it was captured on video and she said I shouldn’t have said anything about a “short time” and if it was a concern it should’ve been mentioned before the wedding (which I did). To be fair, I felt relieved because I’d rather her be upset at me than unsafe. 

I told her that I do believe she got married quickly however that I can respect that she can make her own decisions, and at the end of the day no one’s opinion really matters as long as she’s happy. I also apologised for any hurt I caused and hoped it could be edited out. She hasn’t replied again so I probably shouldn’t have mentioned it again. Might get a reply in January ‘23.

So here's what happened, my boyfriend started driving a coworker home once or twice a week, every week. The first time it was because her car was in the shop, after that apparently her car has stopped working all together. So he has been driving her home every week when they have the same schedule.
The first time I was okay with, it can happen, but after that, after it became something that happens every week, I have been feeling uncomfortable with it. It's not that I don't trust him or that I'm jealous, I just feel uncomfortable. I've been feeling that way for some weeks and today I finally talked with him about it after he told me again that he was driving her home. I said that I understood the first time but since it has become a weekly thing I feel uncomfortable. He didn't took me seriously at first and even laught. He thought I was just being jealous, after he realized I was serious he said that I had to trust him, that nothing happened and nothing was going to happen, I told him that it wasn't about that, that I do trust him but I am not comfortable with the situation. Things escalated and he ended up saying that he wasn't going to drive her home anymore, but that he thought I was being jealous and not trusting him and that he thought I made a scene for nothing and because of something dumb and that my attitude was dumb. Then he said that because his coworker usually walks home when he's not driving her, if something happened to her while she was walking home when he could have taken her instead, that I better not feel guilty or with a heavy conscience. 
So now I don't know what to do. After all that I said that he could do as he wanted, and if he wanted to drive her home so much he could, it's his decision and I wasn't going to say anything more about the situation or bring this up again. 

So AITA? I don't think I am being jealous.

For example, his youngest brothers/ parents get a blanket because they are in one household. His sisters who are married and moved out each get one, his sister who is expecting gets a baby blanket and so on. Unfortunately his oldest brother is a bit estranged from the family but mostly comes to family functions. He has stolen from the family before due to drug problems as well. I considered making him one without hesitation but he recently started berating another of their family member in the family group chat about how “no one gives a F” about their upcoming wedding. This makes me feel like he is undeserving of my handmade work at all but I also feel like it may make me the AH since I will be shipping the blankets out in one big box for them to open during Christmas (we live out of state).

We grew up gaming together and now that we're adults living far apart we still game together. Part of our habit is we're casual streamers. I played horror games for October 2020, but was going to skip the horror in 2021. However he wanted me to play one so I made him a deal: I'll play a horror game of his choice if he played a platform/collectathon of my choice. He agreed.

His game of choice for me was Amnesia Dark Descent. I managed to get through it Halloween Day and streamed the whole affair which took 8.5 hours. Then I revealed my game of choice for him: Beyond Good and Evil. It was implied he should play through it in November. A few weeks into November he did a stream, going for 1.5 hours. He didn't make it terribly far, only doing one dungeon and getting to the hub city.

After that one session he was reluctant to continue. I brought it up frequently but he wouldn't commit. Fast forward several months, long past the deadline, and I stopped being encouraging and expressed my annoyance that he didn't hold up his end. Since then he's made multiple excuses. He said the game seemed like a 20 hour affair which wasn't equal to Amnesia; to counter that I showed him my final save file which was just under 8 hours. He said he wasn't enjoying the game, to which I told him I didn't enjoy Amnesia but I still played through it. He said it's been so long he doesn't want to continue from his save but doesn't want to start over either, which I told him that's his fault and not mine, why am I being punished for it? He said he'd make it up to me by playing Banjo Tooie, another game I wanted him to play, but he only did a single stream of that too and then never continued it.

I'm making it sound more dramatic than it is. While I brought it up frequently I wasn't aggressive about it. He'd say no and we'd go about our business, still playing together and everything. But two things have kinda brought it back up and it's irritating me all over again. First we're at the anniversary of the whole ordeal, it's been a year and he just doesn't see anything wrong with burning me which hurts. The second is that he put 35 hours into Persona 5 on Xbox, a game he's played before on PS4 and expressly hates. He has gone on rants about how much he hates that game, but for some reason he saw fit to dump large amounts of time into it again. If he can do that, why can't he just put 8 into a game I gave a heartfelt recommendation to?

In the grand scheme it's a petty squabble but I'm a petty person and I can' t help but take it personally. I definitely feel more sour to him than usual and don't even feel like gaming together as much. He burned me (twice!) and he doesn't have any remorse over it. He's my brother, I expect better from him.

Nurse (same one) brings another bandage over and refused to let me do it. Fine whatever. I check it and it’s okay this time.

When I told S about this she got really stroppy about it and said that “ but I liked the fact that I could talk to you” which annoyed me and I told her “ I need to make up for lost wages because I took time off Friday bc you asked me to, and I have bills to pay” which she got stroppy about.

now, to preface her reaction to that: I work as a SEASONAL receiver that has incoming trucks every Monday and Wednesday, I work full time, standing all hours on a concrete floor. I used to work ALL 40 hours. until another person in my department would regularly not show up (or call-in) 2/5ths of his work week and be protected by higher management. So I thought it'd be okay- if after lifting all the couches in our department store that I get to relax and take one day off every two weeks. Also, this last Friday was our first snow of the year, and my car was 4 inches deep in snow with bald tires, while I was at the end of my work week, so I called out.

In response, my mother immediately goes into a tirade about how I'm not fit to be an adult, how I'm ruining my future, how everyone was depending on me to be there, how I am going to be fired, and that I am a failure for not being able to afford proper healthcare. Then, the straw that breaks the camel's back is that she says, verbatim ""You know, I don't believe that you were beaten by- (your biological father), in fact, if anyone did beat you, it was me because you deserved it, and you know what el-"" I cut the line.

I was beaten the first six years of my life and try very hard to hide that in my day-to-day life. So much so, my girlfriend didn't know for a year (out of five now), that I didn't tell my therapist friend for 2 years, and I didn't tell my mom I was beaten as a child until 3 months ago, mostly because I knew she would eventually belittle my experiences when she saw fit, as she has done dozens of times before this point in my life. 

Beyond this, the reason she wouldn't know about it, is because she was absent for more than over 6 years of my early childhood (0-12) due to her (volunteering for) deployment and ignoring my pleas when she would come home, all to which she would say ""we beat you when you do something bad."" 

(the only reason I feel so safe in saying all of this here is because I don't equate myself much to being a person online or even being myself, just some sort of amorphous being looking for attention and answers.)

So, at that point, in modern day, I hung up on my mother, and it was shitty of her and me, but I decided not to do anything... later that night my step-father texts me with a  ""would you like this camera?"" which makes me feel like I'm being bribed with a 100$ camera. Then, just in the last 2 hours before writing this, he sends a ""you really need to apologize to your mother."" and I get sent into a spiral all over again because apparently I AM the asshole.-

She then informed me next day, that she is upset with my behaviour in the bus and i shouldn't have tried to "" party,party,party"" in the bus, i should have been there for my friend. 

This is not the first time something like this has happened, last time we had gone to another competition i had won but I quietly put my trophy in my bag didn't celebrate once and she silently cried while sitting beside me in the bus. She did not talk to me at all, and later she again told me she didn't like my behaviour over me being condescending all the time.

He couldn’t tell if I was making a joke and asked if I heard it before then or if I meant just now. I told him “I have heard it before, just a second ago” and I giggled because I was making a light hearted (and admittedly bad) joke. That’s when it got weird. He was frowning, he didn’t look amused in the slightest. He then turned to me and said “Why are you being annoying.” Now I couldn’t tell if he was joking or not so I asked him what he meant. He then continued to repeat to me the exact conversation we just had and reiterated the question followed by “why aren’t you ever serious?” He didn’t mean the question either, it was a rhetorical slight towards me. I got upset because I couldn’t understand how something so small could be considered annoying, especially enough to make him mad. He asked me to leave his room so I just left. 

He was annoyed and he made it very aware that the problem was me. But it was such a small insignificant joke, I can’t figure out why it caused him to lash out at me like that. Was I actually being annoying? Is it bad I’m not serious 50% of the time? I feel bad because I’d hate to make him that upset, but I simultaneously can’t understand what I did wrong. AITA?

so about 4 months in the relationship I was on holiday in Greece for 2 weeks(we live in the UK) where on the last day of the holiday I receive a text saying don't get mad but I've been messaging this other boy (boy  B) who was a crush right before we met. she told me they were just messaging and nothing more and that it was all friendly and notohng bad. when I got home I was on her phone and I see the boy again but all chats and history on Snapchat was cleared erasing everything that was said (we openly know eachothers phone passwords) she said this was just because seeing his name there with the message was bugging her.  I chose to believe her in the sense that they both meant nothing by it just a catch-up. 

then in the 9month mark I went on holiday again to South Africa for 2 weeks. where towards the end of the holiday I get another alarming message at about 11pm saying that just her and her boy bsf (boy Y) who I've never met and to my knowledge werent freinds anymore. were going to go out for a drive since he just got his license that day.

I cannot imagine anything less relaxing than being on vacation with two toddlers, and as I said, I haven't been on vacation in six years.

I went with my fiancée to go visit them along with my sibling and his spouse for dinner over the weekend. 

Being my fiancée’s first time meeting this aunt, I was shocked at her disrespectful behavior towards her. This aunt did not say hello to her, make eye contact with her, speak to her, or even acknowledge her existence. Super lovey-dovey with everyone else, me included. But for some reason she was super intensely spiteful with her and looked as if she had a bone to pick. Even made some not-so-subtle nasty comments at how she was eating and sitting (under her breath), which everyone noticed and looked uncomfortable with.

My mom eventually came up with an excuse to take us downstairs and away from the dinner table (and the aunt) to look at Christmas decorations. While downstairs she kept apologizing for her aunt’s behavior and said she seemed out of control and “not well”. Eventually she followed us downstairs and continued her glaring and insults. We decided it was best to leave, she came in to give me a hug goodbye, whispered that “I could do better and to do what’s best for me and the family”. My fiancée tried to say goodbye and give her a hug and say “nice to meet you”, but was ignored. We left with my fiancée in tears saying she had never felt so humiliated or disrespected.

My parents got upset with this aunt’s behavior and “told her off” in private. But also made the excuse to me that apparently she was like that with everyone and to not take it personally and just suck it up. That family is more important, to just ignore her behavior and not sacrifice Thanksgiving with the family because of one bad apple. Eventually the truth came out that this lovely old aunt is a racist towards Asians (we are a predominantly Hispanic family) and no one thought to warn me or my fiancée (who is Asian) of this. 

After some profuse apologies from my family and promises that they “had our back” and even insinuations that “maybe she’s becoming senile and showing signs of dementia” they insisted we still go with them to our extended family’s house for Thanksgiving. I asked if this aunt would be going, and they said “well of course, she’s family”. Well after her behavior to my fiancée, who’s to say she wouldn’t treat her the same way again or worse? I told them off “either you stick to your word that you have our backs and love us by telling her she’s not going to Thanksgiving, or you’re enabling that behavior and condoning it—which I can’t forgive and I’ll take as a sign that we shouldn’t go.”

My parents and sibling refuse to see my side, insist we apologize now for stirring up drama and “dividing the family and ruining the holidays”. I informed them this morning we would not be attending this year (my first time skipping out) and have had radio silence ever since.

Regardless of our relationship, she can still see my kids, they WILL be supervised visits, and her partner cannot come anywhere near my kids.

Instead of adhering to these rules, my mother chooses to see my kids MAYBE twice a year, she does not call outside of that. She also badmouths me and lies that I don't allow her to see her grandchildren to anyone who will listen.

With that background here is what happened. I was talking to my grandmother, giving her updates on my family when she made the comment: ""I wish you would call your mother and tell her all of this, I never remember when she asks!""

Hard stop for me. My response was ""You have no business sharing any of this with her. If she wants an update she is welcome to come see the kids or she can call them. She chooses not to!"" After a lot of back and forth, where she spouted the lies my mother told her I ended the conversation with: ""The bottom line is you do not have to agree with me, but you don't have to respect my decision. If I find out that you gave her any information about my family, you will no longer receive that information."" 

The thing is I will find out because my family gossips like it's a sport and they are aiming for the Olympics. I have already made this stance known to all my family.

I'm pretty emotional today so I need outside input.

I (F50's)have a friend (F40's) who I really do like a lot. She can be so funny and awesome. She also has a lot of health issues and she \*loves\* to focus on those issues. Every conversation at some point turns to her problems. She's pretty dramatic about everything. 

Now 99% of the time I let all of this roll off and it doesn't bother me. I know what I'm in for when she's around and I'm willing to accept it.

So here's where I need to know if I did anything wrong. She texts me this morning about her grandma taking a fall and she's very dramatic about it and how it's all affecting her mental health. I texted back a little bit saying I was praying for her and her grandma. However, I was being slammed at work this morning and couldn't really get into a texting conversation with her so I texted her, ""I'm sorry but I'm being slammed at work. I'll chat later."" She got offended and said she was sorry to have bothered me.

Then later I found out about my foster son dying yesterday. He lived with us during his senior year of high school. He had since gotten married, had kids and was working a great job. He was 25. I am completely heartbroken.  I texted her that he had died and asked for prayer. (We're Christian) She wanted to talk right then and there.  I told her I couldn't talk (was still at work) and that I needed some time to process this. 

I knew she was offended so I texted her tonight that I was sorry if I was short with her earlier but I'm a bit of an emotional wreck right now.

She texts back ""yeah, you were really short with me and I'm glad you're mature enough to recognize it. I do understand that's a big deal for you though""

Every fiber of my being wants to snap back at her that yes, having a kid that lived with you for almost a year and that you've been close with ever since dying is a BIG DEAL. (she doesn't have kids) 

I'm just seriously hurt that even this she is turning around to paint herself as a victim.

My sister (27f) is a single mom of three (one with special needs) all have different dad's none are in the picture (one is in jail, another was a one night stand in Vegas doesn't even remember his first name, and the other is just an unemployed deadbeat). She's drowning in debt (mostly medical bills for special needs child) and got fired from multiple jobs due to having to always call out due to her special needs child having some medical emergency, she's months behind on rent but landlord hasn't evicted her bc he feels sorry for her. 

My husband (42m) and I are child free by choice, while we aren't Vanderbilt's by any stretch we do have a comfortable lifestyle. We were going to use my portion of the inheritance for a down payment on a house (we live in an apartment albeit a nice one) and to treat ourselves to a nice vacation in Europe (I've never been there but DH has and I've always wanted to go). 

My sister's portion of the inheritance will cover some of her debt (she wants to pay off creditors first bc they're threatening to take her to court while the landlord is showing more leniency), but my family is saying I should give her my share of the inheritance because that would cover almost all her debt (she wasn't spending frivolously it was mostly the mounting medical bills for my special needs nephew), and it's ""more important"" than a house because we're ""fine in our apartment"" and this is ""more urgent.""

Im no prude or slut shamer but bottom line is my sister was wreckless in having unprotected sex with multiple men and getting pregnant by three separate ones who for various reasons can't/don't help and that's not my fault, I don't feel my husband and I should have to sacrifice our dream of being homeowners (which is incredibly hard to do these days) and having to sacrifice this vacation I've always wanted to go on.

Their mother (they see every other weekend and alt holidays) is SUPER high conflict and we practice parallel parenting. Ive also been very strategic in my interactions to try to build a rapport And relationship before coming on too strong and trying to fully parent them, despite being in their lives for 5 years now we still haven’t quite connected due to the bad mouthing and alienation from their high conflict mother.  

One of the strategies our blended family coach and our family therapist think will work is  Something like nachoing which entails of avoiding anything that will cause a negative interaction, play therapy and being the initiator of all the gifts and fun activities. 

This has worked someWhat and I’ve developed a bond with at least 2 (SD13/SS10). I know this is not their fault and they are caught in the middle so I’m not taking this personal but while I was on vacation I got my three stepdaughters Alex and Ani Bracelets. They always raved about them.  They came over for a day visit while on their summer visitation with their mom and I excitedly gave them the bracelets. That was in the summer and I haven’t seen them wear it since. Curious, I asked the oldest what happened to them. “They are at our mothers” (read: my mother confiscated them)

Okayyy…

So I ask my middle stepdaughter— the one I’ve got a bond with and who used to wear a bunch of knock off versions and is the inspiration for why I got them—what happened to her bracelet. At first She “didn’t remember” But after showing a pic “I don’t have it any more, it’s at moms house?” I can tell in her eyes: (read: mom confiscated them and I don’t want to hurt your feelings)

So I reach out to my blended family community for advice and they think I should ask for them back. 

So that’s what I did…AITA for asking them to bring them back?

I don’t get a chance to tell hubby until tonight because he is on nights and I work days. Had he looked at the Facebook post, he would have seen where they were spoken for, however.

As we are eating supper before he leaves, he makes the comment ‘I guess we’re just gonna have to give those tickets away.’ to which I said they were spoken for and the friend who had spoken for them was going to bring the money to me tomorrow. 

He went absolutely berserk and started screaming that he had listed them on StubHub and why didn’t I tell him. I countered back on him and told him had he told me he was going to list them on StubHub, I never would’ve listed them on Facebook, and that I had only done what he asked me to do. His response was that he shouldn’t have to tell me he was listing them in multiple places. 

I told him that it was a simple thing now that he knew to cancel the listing on StubHub because they were spoken for. Then I left to go deliver our son to his grandmothers for a sleepover. While I am gone, I get a text message from him. ‘Bad news, honey. They sold at 0700 on StubHub.’ Meaning he expects me to tell my friend she can’t have them. 

Told him to look at the Facebook post because they were claimed way before he ever posted them on StubHub and that he needed to cancel the sale. My friend and I are all excited about going to the game and sitting next to each other because we both love this team. 

His solution to this is to let both sales go through and then find us two more tickets to the same game, however, they will probably be in the nosebleed section. I told him no way. He screwed up, I’m not giving up my original seats, he needs to fix it. He says I’m being ridiculous for sticking to my guns because I want to sit with my friend.

He clicks around on his phone for a while and pretends like he’s doing something, and then says he can’t cancel the sale once it’s gone through, which I know is complete malarkey. I told him if he won’t fix it then HE can text my friend and tell her it was his screwup.

He said i bring his livelyhood in jeopardy and that what i'm doing is not ok, but i feel like what i'm asking for is fair. I also suggested he could get another roommate so he doesn't have to start a new lease. He stormed off and took some of his belongings into a different room now. 

I understand this decision affects him negatively, and i don't think it's necessarily fair to him, but i do think i need this and i need to put myself first in this situation

I understand he feels upset and hurt and on top of everything else he's been going through, it really does feel like his life is kind of crumbling down, and i feel extremely guilty for it. I just don't want to put my own mental health at stake and i don't know how to navigate this in a way that would be beneficial to both of us

I have an ok amount of money in my bank so when she asks to loan like £20 I can obviously afford it but I don't even want to just out of principle, I ask her not to ask me for money but she STILL DOES IT EVERY TIME I ASK HER NOT TO then when I say no she starts acting like a baby for no reason giving one word answers and scowling as if I've somehow wronged her

Recently I've paid her my next months rent 3 weeks early and loaned her £200 on top of that, she always pays loans back but I just don't want to do it anymore because every other day is something she simply can't do without and she tries to guilt me into lending her it

She always does a lot for me but any time I come into any kind of money she acts like she's entitled to a loan since 'I can afford it now' and I just want my money to stay in my bank and not have her looming over me like a literal shadow just seeing if I'll lend her another £20 or something",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4816737,public,top,self,AITA for not wanting to lend my mum money even though I can afford it?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2ab44/aita_for_not_wanting_to_lend_my_mum_money_even/,all_ads,6,,,,

She was in town for a few days and I came to found out that she'd be staying at my flat. (For context, I live in uni accommodation where a flat has completely separate rooms. My friend was technically staying in one of those rooms but was never really there and so he let that girl stay in his room while she was here).

Right off the bat, this girl was into me. Things got touchy quickly and after a couple minutes of conversation, we were making out. We were making out for a while, during which I got a bit high and she had a bit to drink. She's a pretty small girl but it was still very surprising how fast she got absolutely hammered. In the span of 2 drinks she went from fine to limp/slow responses. Even though I had smoked, I immediately recognized that I was still way more aware than her and slowed things down significantly. She protested about this but again, she was drunk and irrational plus I had just met her.

It's worth noting at this point that she had been getting a lot of texts from a 'worried friend' who eventually decided to come pick her up from the party. Eventually when her friend arrived, I walked her down and she fell into his arms. I offered to go with them (again, she was literally staying at my flat). He declined even after I offered twice and they left. If I was more sober, I think I would've insisted.

Around half an hour later I decide to go home myself. Immediately, I could hear a lot of ""noise"" coming from her room. Now the facts were in my head as follows:

1. Last time I saw this girl she was drunk out of her mind
2. She was walked home by a guy whose relationship to her I never truly established
3. This guy seemed particularly insistent on being alone with her

Intuitively, I opened the door.

After giving them a moment to get themselves together (couldn't see them until I actually walked in)., I started asking questions about how aware she was, how much she sobered up, how well he knew her. This went on for a few minutes with him embarrassed but responsive and her just burying herself in her covers, not speaking that much. He basically explained that she had sobered up and agreed to this, and they have done this sober before.

After I felt assured that everyone was safe, I left them and went back to my room. A couple minutes later, the guy knocks on my door to talk to me. He says that he gets why I did what I did but that she was upset that I had just barged in on her and that he'd appreciate it if I could go just apologize and sort everything out. I told him that she could come talk to me herself in the morning when she's completely sorted out and that if he needed anything else, he knew where I lived.

We haven't talked about anything since and she's removed me from her Instagram. She's left the city now and I don't think I'm ever gonna speak to her again, which doesn't really bother me since I only knew her for a day.

Earlier tonight we were just messing around, and he gently slipped his arm across my neck in a rear choke. I instinctively did what I'm meant to do, which is tuck my chin protecting my neck down to separate his arm from my neck and allow myself to breathe. I succeeded in doing this the first time, and then a few minutes later he did the same, but he was much more aggressive and I felt a burning sensation as he tightened his grip around my neck.

After like 10 seconds he didn't get the memo even though I was flailing about (I flailed about the first time too but with far less urgency I feel, the first time was also more of a joke) and I was also making incoherent noises because it was extremely uncomfortable. When he pulled away I was upset and told him that it hurt. He just called me my nickname over and over again without saying anything else, even when I told him to ""answer me."" After that, he insisted it wasn't even that hard to which I reminded him I am much weaker than him, it's a fact

Even after he realised he had hurt me he didn't apologise, just told me that he had no way of knowing I was hurt, and that I'd had the same reaction both times he had done it. I believe him when he says he had no way of knowing because this man genuinely is so mild apart from when it comes to his physical strength. What irks me is that he is annoyed at the fact I am upset - even if it was a misunderstanding I feel like I have a right to be upset, especially when I had to force an apology out of him.

My (m26) partner (f27) came home today to ask me to make some changes concerning drinking alcohol. 

For context, my partner and I have a good relationship, they recently have been going to group therapy everyday for the past two weeks to focus on bettering themselves in their daily lives. Today, she and her therapist talked about my partner’s drinking habits and they both concluded that she may be bordering on alcoholism; I would disagree with this, but it’s not my place to make that judgement or tell my partner how they’d like to live. 

My partner today asked that, to support her, we remove alcohol from the house, and I stop drinking around her, even if at home. I admitted it was a little bit of a change but I was happy to do that, I told them that I want to make sure they feel safe and supported in the environments we share.

Now for where things got tricky. My partner and I had previously planned to go to karaoke at a brewery on the invitation of my friend (m32) who we will call Joe. My partner asked that I not drink when we go to karaoke with Joe as she doesn’t want to be the only sober person there. Ultimately I can understand that, at the same time however, I don’t want to have to compromise the experience[s] I share with my friend[s] to worry that my partner feels safe and supported. I feel as though that I can share an experience as intended with my friend as well as make sure that she is safe and feeling supported.

My partner became very quiet, then telling me that she was disappointed and that she did not feel supported. I felt hurt by that, as I said that I would support her at home and when we are together, but I don’t equate support to compromising the relationships I share with the other people in my life.

They said if I was trans we could be acquainted and maybe friends. I was upset. 

I called them out. I started out by saying that they did not deserve the harassment by those people, and that their consent was not respected. 
I also said that those people being a predator has nothing to do with the fact that they are trans. They are just a predator and just so happens to be trans. We are both POC and have the same opinions about how harmful racism is. So I tried to use comparisons such as “I’ve heard my trans and gay friends complain about their oppression and I feel for them because I’m an ally. So do you think it’s fair that I listen to their struggles but then come back to you that say they wouldn’t be close with a trans person? It’s similar to me having a non POC friend and they claim to be an ally of POC but then go to their other friend and that friend says micro aggressions”. 

They respond by saying that I am invalidating their trauma. That I am being emotional and not speaking with facts. They say that being LGBT is a choice and that being a person of color is not. They also asked “so if a woman is assaulted by a man and she doesn’t trust men, does that make them a misandrist?”. They even say that they have a gay brother and have many gay supporters And that because they don’t feel comfortable getting too close with a gay friend does not make them homophobic. That they still think gay people are fine. Before I could even respond, they tell me to have a “nice life”.

My (26m) and husband (32m) invited my brother (28m) to live with us. We felt sorry because he was dumped, was barely making any money, and was going to end up homeless. So we decided to get a bigger apartment and let him stay with us longer.

During the lease, he tormented us, stole from us, and made it all around miserable. So when the lease was up(May 2021), we told him we aren’t staying but he is free to keep the apartment if he signs us off the lease. We agreed that we will deep-clean our space in the apartment and forfeit the security deposit as long as he takes us off the lease. We just wanted to get away from him.

He signed us off the lease and brought two of his friends that were supposed to sign on. As soon as the property manager told my husband and I that we were all good, we left.

Almost a year later (April 2022) I got an email about the apartment being in a non-compliance state and that I have 7 days to contact them or we are evicted. They did not respond to emails and didn’t answer the phone, so I drove an hour to the office to deal with it. Turns out that my brother’s friends never finished signing the new lease, so they renewed the lease that already existed (with our names on it) and the management changed. The new manager had myself and my brother write statements that he is solely responsible. The manager said we were all ok.

We continued to get emails about the property the following week, and I said “since my husband and I are not on a lease, I shouldn’t be getting emails” manager responded and confirmed.

**Now the real issue**
I received a phone call yesterday from a collections agency saying that we (my brother) owes them money for damages. After he signed us off the lease, he and his friends turned the apartment into a drug den that reeked of the smell, floors covered in animal waste, holes in walls, broken door, etc.

The management has changed AGAIN and the new manager said that if she can’t find documentation for me being taken off the lease, that she will still hold me responsible. I was advised that I could choose to sue the apartment for not taking me off the lease and harassment (but I don’t have the documentation that we signed, just an email) or I could sue my brother for not keeping up his side of the deal and for destroying the apartment that I haven’t stepped foot in for 18 months. (I have countless texts from him about how I’m not in the lease anymore.). My father and grandfather say to sue my brother, mother says to go after the company.

I intended to get approved for a mortgage as soon as the holidays were over, but I’m not willing to pay my brother’s fee and it would hurt my credit if not paid. (I have 800 credit).

My husband is not attending because of financial reasons so he has to stay here and work. For context, we live in Kansas and they live in Virginia. It’s a long drive or flight either way.

Recently, I gave birth to a beautiful girl and she’s 3 months old. My brother “Joel” and his wife “Lauren” were supposed to come to thanksgiving in Kansas this year so they could see everyone and meet my daughter Selah. They decided not to come because plane tickets are mega expensive and they would be staying for an extended weekend. Understandable. By the time they meet Selah at the wedding she will be almost a year old. 

Lauren is from Florida and comes from an extremely rich family (like millionaire type). We were raised comfortably and our parents never had to worry about providing for us. We weren’t ever pressed for money but we also weren’t abundantly wealthy. Pretty much middle class. (This is important for later on.)

Over a year ago Joel and Lauren got married in the courthouse so they could live together and have benefits and such. This July they’re having a “wedding” so they can celebrate since they didn’t get a honeymoon. There were a lot of pieces missing and both of them acting strange until they talked to my parents and told them that Lauren’s parents don’t know they got married in the courthouse. So, naturally, her parents are going all out and having a huge wedding for them. Everything is extremely high quality and expensive and my parents aren’t able to match the expenses Joel and Lauren are wanting for the wedding. 

A couple days after they break the news about not coming to thanksgiving, they ask my parents for a $3,000 down payment on the rehearsal dinner and a credit card number for an open bar. That’s more than my oldest brothers wedding and my wedding combined cost them. My parents also spent some money on my oldest brothers honeymoon and my honeymoon for a couple nights at a hotel. Lauren heard about it from my sister-in-law and she’s now expecting my parents to pay for their international honeymoon. 

When my parents confronted and corrected her about the expenses, Lauren threw out the “well my daddy…” card. (Yes, I saw the texts and she said daddy. Keep in mind this woman is 24.) 

my dad had to talk to my brother separately and set boundaries for what they were going to pay for.

I'll admit to being difficult to buy for, because I make good money and buy myself most of what I want.
Sometimes, at a loss, my husband will promise me something instead of a physical item. Example: he promised to pay for my next tattoo, he promised to give me a night in a hotel. Alone. He promised a trip to Jamaica for my pandemic era birthday. Etc.

So lately, he's been working less - he's self employed, and therefore making less money. Some is circumstances, some is his choice to have better work/life balance. And my arc is totally the opposite. Yet, he's found the time and funds to get 3 new tattoos this fall. So I brought up the tattoo/promise/gift and I got a vaguely cranky response about there being a statute of limitations on these gifts. Which upset me, tbh. We just came out of 2 years in a pandemic and are still finding our life rhythm.

So tonight he tells me about yet another tattoo appointment he's going to have and I bring up the intangible promise gifts again. I ask if I'll ever get mine.

He says he doesn't even remember offering me that. Okayyyy. Then he says I'm being selfish and I can afford to get it myself, so why should he - who is making less money - have to sacrifice something he is doing for himself to give me a gift I can afford myself?

My opinion is that it's because he 'gave' it to me as a gift.... And I don't remember there being an expiration date or disclaimer. Because there wasn't. It just makes me feel shitty that my gifts don't matter now...? 

TLDR: hubs promised intangible gifts when he was making more money and is now saying I can just get them for myself, since I'm doing better financially.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4816644,public,top,self,AITA for asking for intangible gifts that were promised?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z29k79/aita_for_asking_for_intangible_gifts_that_were/,all_ads,6,,,,

Recently on a car ride home with my mother, I had an irritation around the area of my scrotum. So I quietly began scratching it. While doing this, my lower bowel began getting rather irritated, so without making a big deal, I started itching around in the inside of my anus. Making general conversation with my mother, I said ""That is possibly the best feeling ever"", to which she turned around and laughed.

In summer I started hanging out with my sister’s friends and he was in the group. 
He told my sister and the other friends I was interesting and he would leave his girlfriend to be with me.

Two months later while I was at a party and a bit tipsy he came up to me to flirt and hours later we kissed. Since that summer I was interested in him too but he had a girl, so I was waiting for him to leave her.

After the kiss I told my friend about it expecting her to get angry but not her blocking me. She told me I was the worst, that she wouldn’t done that to me and I didn’t exist for her anymore. She also wished me well on being the second choice (because that what she was with him years later) not knowing anything about what happened or any other info.
She then unfollowed me from anywhere, after blocking my number.
