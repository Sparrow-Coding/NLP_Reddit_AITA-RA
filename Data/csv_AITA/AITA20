I have a hard time understanding tone and I struggle to effectively communicate with allistic people. 

This story started a couple days ago in my fifth period class. We were studying momentum and velocity if I’m remembering correctly. The teacher had just handed back our tests and I got a 38/50 points. The girl sitting behind me says,

“Nice work OP!”

and she started laughing when she turned back to her friends. 

So I asked her if she was being sarcastic or if she was actually congratulating me. She didn’t reply and her and her friends just erupted in laughter instead. 

I told her I was serious and I was asking her a question which only made them laugh even more. 

I finally snapped and yelled, 

“I’m autistic okay?! Just tell me if you’re serious or not!!” 

The girl stared at me in shock and her friends started laughing again, I’m assuming at her. A group of kids from a table nearby realized what was going on so they started yelling at the girl. They kept telling her it wasn’t okay to make fun of anyone let alone the autistic kid. 

The teacher, who had just realized there were screaming children in her classroom, gave the girl and the kids from the other table detention for being disruptive. The girl got angry at the teacher and asked her why I wasn’t getting detention too. She said that I was the victim in this situation and I only yelled because I was taunted. 

After that class the girl followed me half-way to my sixth period before grabbing me by my backpack loop and pulling me into the girl’s bathroom. She started going off on me about how I was an awful person and I was an asshole for getting her detention. I asked her what she was talking about and how was it my fault that she was mean to me. 

She said the only reason I didn’t get detention was because I “weaponized my autism” and the teacher didn’t want to punish the r-worded kid. She told me that I only mentioned I was autistic so I could misbehave without punishment and that I’m a massive asshole for that.

so i (16f) never really dated anyone before but one of my best friends laura (17f) has dated and recently broke up with her first bf, so last week we were at the park and we met with some guy in our grade, josh, (17m) and his cousin from another school, adam (18m) 
laura really liked adam and she got our friend to get her his instagram and they got together after talking for just a few hours, well she found out from adam that josh was lonely and looking for someone and soon after asked for MY snap. she gave him it and said ill think about it (before telling me btw) well i didnt rlly mind and added him back anyway and we texted. the next day he asked me to be his gf and to be honest i didnt like him but i said yes because i felt guilty and was afraid to ruin lauras relationship. ( i know i shouldnt have led him on thats 100% on me)
i mentioned my hesitancy to laura and my other best friend amanda (17f) but they just said that wed be cute together and encouraged us, but they said that if i didnt want to date him they werent going to force me. well the weekened came up an we went to the same park and both laura and i hung out with our bfs. NOTE before i continue : he wanted to hug and kiss, i said i didnt want to kiss and he agreed but then he kissed me anyway. we kissed 8 times or something and it felt disgusting. i feel bad but i hated it. i didnt say anything but after that i talked to another friend who said i should break up with him, and then the more i thought about it the more i realised that leading him on like this would only make things worse especially because he was already talking about kids and marriage after only 3 days of dating. i sent him a short paragraph explaning how im not ready but i didnt mention that i didnt like him. well idk what i expected but he begged me to stay and said that he knew im lying to myself and that i AM ready for a relationship, he said he knows me and to trust him but i couldnt. he then asked for us to kiss again, i said no. he asked for us to not date but meetup once a week to kiss and hug/cuddle, i said no again. he asked to be flirty friends i said maybe but id rather not. i then sent him a prett long paragraph telling him how its not his fault after i found out he blamed himself. he said i was amazing and asked again to get back together i said no but i let him know id always be there for him as a friend. during this amanda was very supportive and so was laura but laura said she wasnt taking sides and that i broke his heart and should’ve told him earlier but its only been 3 days she said shes still here for me but i cant help but feel like im the asshole, i know i shouldve told him earlier but idk how to make it better so aita?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4809111,public,top,self,AITA for leading my best friend’s cousin on?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z08qn9/aita_for_leading_my_best_friends_cousin_on/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

We never really got along, 2 of them didn't work on the project until very late (like 2 weeks ago), let's call them A and B, and didn't ask for our (mine and C) opinion at all 

1.  A is so insistant and hates to be proven wrong, we just agreed on what she did to not slow the project down too much.
2. I'm a really stressed person and don't like to work on things really fast at the end when you have to rush everything.
3. The deadline for this project is in 3 days.

Last wednesday, we talked to our teachers, showed them what we (A and B) did, they told us to change a lot of things (of course...). Since C works on the week end, and A works on monday/tuesday, and since A and B didn't want to stay longer at school so we could work together irl, they always asked us to work online.We were suppose de have a call yesterday at 8AM to settle every aspect of the project so we could start working on the visuals, but no one came; I was getting really stressed and send messages but didn't get any answers. So me and C  wrote on our group conversation that we absolutely had to talk today at 8AM, no one came again. I sent a message again but no one read it.

C convinced me to send a message to our teacher to explain the situation. I wans't feeling comfortable about it but ended up doing it and he wrote a message to our group.His message went like this : I have to send a message to your group about your communication issues; and some of you don't answer to the others messages ? What a nice proof of respect and capability to work together as a team; if things don't get better I will adjust my way to grade you

This time A and B answered telling me that I was immature for talking to our teacher instead of talking to them first and that I didn't have to do such a thing just because they didn't answer my call 2 times in a row. And they both answered to our teacher's message wich went like this : Sorry that you had to get involved with something so immature, we would have settled this between us if we were even aware of those problems you're refering to, we doubt the veracity of the ""facts"" that were exposed to you and assure you that we are doing everything we can to make this work-

I am not good with confrontation, I'm the kind of hyper sensitive person who cries everytime I have to explain myself, so I told them that we could have worked together on these problems if they answered my messages. They we're not happy about it.

I know that this wasn't the right way to go about this, but if the teacher's message came from me, I feel like no one would've cared.

(Also i have to mention Emma had made out with my bestfriends ex flirt without telling us and kept it a secret untill my bestfriend found out) 

At some point they stopped seeing each other and she started dating someone . After 1 month of dating they broke up and around that time was my bestfriends birthday. I went to the birthday and John was there we spent the birthday drinking and having fun i remember Emma telling me she was gonna make a move on this other boy and i said go for it. 

(Her and the boy eventually started dating but recently they broke up.)

After a few more drinks me and John were wasted and he leaned in and we started making out, apparently Emma saw this and started crying but i didn’t know it until our mutual friend told me)

Me and Emma talked about it a lot i apologized like 50 times. She said she wasn’t mad at me and wasn’t upset and she said i can do whatever i want and then we spoke about the kiss sharing our experience. 

A few weeks after that me and a lot of my friends stopped being friends with Emma for different reasons and it became a whole thing.

At some point i texted Emma because i felt bad about some certain things that happened after we stopped being friends and i wanted to apologize for them. She replied and we spoke on the phone for like 2 hours apologizing and being honest about everything.

But last night i went out with some friends and Emmas ex the one she met at the party was there.

I (23/F) live with my sister (19/F) while I go to work and she goes to university. While I might be older, she's considered the more responsible one in the family (because our parents think I'm just a little bit of a trainwreck no biggie) and I have no problem with that. I have dealt with an eating disorder for almost 7-8 years, and I'm still recovering. I've had to deal with it alone since the beginning. I'll probably always be recovering, and I'm willing to admit that I'm still not done with it. It's a process, if you know what I mean. 

So, this means I need company when I'm eating. At work, I always find someone to eat with and when I'm home, I need my sister to eat with me because it really helps sometimes. The problem is that she doesn't have regular eating habits. They changed a bit when we went back to live with our parents during the pandemic and messed up their eating schedules (I wasn't around because my study/work involves going into hospital)

This might be a very small thing- might be insignificant to so many people. But, I've time and time again asked her to eat with me or to give me company while I eat.

I later find out she is telling people I'm abusive because I raised my voice and called her names when she told me. Go figure I found out she is keeping the cheating a secret when she is telling people. Fuck that, I set our friends straight. 90% are with me on this while she's pissed I'm telling the truth.

What really put me over the edge was that she was still in contact with him and fought me to block him. For a moment I thought I could salvage this. Regardless, I told her I'll never take her back and I'll never be friends with her. First thing she did was unblock him and reached out.

Here is the situation. She is from a small town in Spain and I met her whole family. She met mine too but not important to this. When I was at her home, I learned of a story that was pretty damning. Keep in mind this story happened way before we started dating. One of her good friend's cousin is married to this man. The man gave my girlfriend a ride from some event in there hometown. A bunch of people saw them leave and told the wife. The wife confronted both of them and the both denied anything more than a ride happened. Lies. They went back to her place and fucked. After this whole debacle, everyone told the wife maybe nothing did happen and she dropped it. Where it gets fucked up is that they meet again and fuck some more all while this is going on. Guilt got the best of the man and he backed out. 

My ex's good friend, point blank, asked her did she sleep with him? My ex said no. 

I learned all this from my ex. I couldn't tell if she was bragging or guilty but she shrugs and does that oops emoji face. I asked her if she will ever tell the truth? She said never, the past is the past. It all felt very bad for me. 

Either way, I told my ex's good friend (cousin of the wife) about the lies as we've hung out many time when things were good. To my shock, she defended my ex and said she won't tell her cousin. I thought, trash protects trash.

Would I be an asshole if I reached out to the wife and give her confirmation that her husband is a cheater? The difference between now and back then is they now have a son. Besides getting back at my ex, if I was in a relationship I would want to know if I'm dating a cheater. Even from a stranger I've never met. Whatever I had with my ex is dead so I don't give a fuck what she thinks. I'll probably throw in her cousin knows and refused to tell.

I'm probably going to do it but I want to see if I'll be in the wrong.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4809078,public,top,self,WIBTA if I tell a married man's wife my ex girlfriend slept with him way before we got together?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z08h0g/wibta_if_i_tell_a_married_mans_wife_my_ex/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

We spend a ton of time at their house, especially on weekends. My boyfriend and his cousin *Tim were practically raised as brothers and still see each other that way, and Tim's wife, *Amy, and I have become pretty close friends over the roughly 2.5 years she's been with Tim. 

This past year, Tim and Amy got a new house that was considerably bigger than the one they'd been living in previously. Tim and Amy have both also switched jobs relatively recently (post-new house) and Amy's job switch was so recent that she won't get her first paycheck for a few weeks yet. Recently the weather around here got really cold, and the past several times we went to their house, it was really cold inside the house as well. I knew they had had some difficulties contacting the propane company to get the tank refilled, but didn't realize it was still an issue.

This last weekend, my boyfriend asked me to take it easy on mentioning the cold, since they hadn't been able to get things fixed and he thought it was making Tim and Amy feel bad. (For reference, the temp was in the 40s inside) I agreed, but the next morning when Tim and I were talking in the living room and he brought up the topic, I asked about the propane company, thinking maybe he wanted to vent about the difficulties he'd been having. Tim then told me that the actual problem was they couldn't afford to pay for the propane.

With the holidays right around the corner, I thought it might be nice to get the family to pitch in and help Tim and Amy out. I'm close with much of the family as my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 7 years and I knew many would be happy to chip in so that Tim and Amy had one less thing to worry about this year. I brought it up to my boyfriend and he said he had thought about he and I paying for it, but we couldn't ask others in the family because it was Tim and Amy's financial situation and not ours to tell. I suggested just not telling anyone that they couldn't afford it but rather say it was a home improvement they wanted that we were financing as a gift, but he was adamant. The problem is neither of to us can afford to take on this cost ourselves either, which is why I wanted to recruit more of the family. My boyfriend said before I could do that, I needed to ask Tim and Amy if that was okay, so last night I brought it up to Amy and she seemed receptive. After we left though she texted my boyfriend saying I had put her down for not being able to afford the $1000 for the new tank and she was bothered by my suggestion. Now my boyfriend is saying I never should have asked and should have gone with his plan, and that I need to apologize for putting Amy down. AITA for trying to help?

My dad (M57) said that he wanted to see the baby so we agreed to facetime. My stepmum (f33) invited herself on the call which annoyed my wife and I but we didn't have the energy to argue. Stepmum made a comment that I should sort out a will just in case my cancer from when I was little came back, which threw me a bit because it was their first time meeting the baby and she was just talking about me. I said that my wife and I both keep on top all the legal stuff and I asked if they had a plan.

Dad then said that should stepmum die first, everything would go to him, then split between me, my nearly two year old half brother and any future children (my other siblings are on my mum and stepdad's side)  and left it at that. Then I pointed out (probably that dad is significantly older than stepmum and he went silent. stepmum explained that all of dad's stuff and insurance would go to her and, when she dies, to her children. I asked if I was included in any of that and she told me to stop being spoilt.

I should note that this isn't some huge aristocratic fortune but they're upper middle class and can afford a lot more than anyone else in my family. My wife and I are also solidly middle class so we do alright financially.

Then I asked could I at least have the mountain bike. Dad used to spend thousands on bicycles and there's one we used work on together when I spent weekends there, especially as a teenager. We even made attachments so that I could ride it with my accessibility needs. Dad told me that he sold it on ebay to make more room when stepmum moved in.

Here's where I feel like I I could have been acting out of order. I said that it wasn't fair that his new family got everything when we still have a relationship. He said that stepmum's a stay at home mum and they're trying for another baby, while I'm planning to go back to work after maternity leave so she could do with everything .

I asked her if she expected the guy to pay and she ghosted me. So I found her on IG, watched her story, and then asked if she would let me take her out for dinner. She agreed.

She was really pretty and we kissed at the end of the date. I asked her to meet again, but this time I just said meet, and SHE suggested the place. She has no car also so I had to drive 15 minutes to see her.

When the check came, she looked at me and asked me if I would get it. I said no, and explained how I believe in equality. She started crying. Her excuse for crying? She said me not paying ""made her feel like she wasn't worth it"", whatever that means.

She then asked if it was because I didn't have enough money and I told her that no, it was simply the principle of equality. She gave me a snobby look and then I explained that I have lots of other women that are into me.

So the waitress came and we both put our cards in I (rightfully) locked my card beforehand so that her card would get charged for the whole thing. When she found out that her card was charged for the whole meal, this girl was furious at me for no reason, again I just wanted equality and had paid for everything the first time.

I was even a gentleman and walked her home to her house down the street, but she just huffed and puffed and rejected me when I asked to put my arms around her. I told her that sometimes couples fight and that I couldn't have read her mind since I didn't know I was supposed to pay again on the second date.

I told her I had to go to the bathroom so she said ""Fine, go"" angrily and then after I went, I took off my socks and she said ""Did I say you were staying? then she kicked me out. I asked her if she would at least come out in the driveway to talk about it, but she refused.

I even texted her a week later saying how cute and interesting I thought she was, and that I was hoping we could kiss a bit for the second date. She has just completely ghosted me all because I simply stood up for myself and advocated equality.

We’re only going to be living here for the next few months so we enrolled our daughter into an international school so she doesn’t have to change her curriculum.

It’s important to note that my husband is Chilean, I am Polish, our daughter is obviously both and she speaks both, Spanish and Polish, as well as English because we normally live in London.

With that out of the way, we moved into our new house a little while ago. Our neighbour has a  little girl around Mora’s age and they’ve become friends quickly. I’ve only met the mum a few times but she seemed lovely enough.

Anyway, a few days ago, I was reading a book on my porch when I saw my neighbour, Leah, pulling into her driveway. When she saw me, she motioned at me to wait for her so I put on my flip flops and came over to help carry her groceries while she tells me whatever she wanted to tell me.

She started the conversation normally but then quickly turned into what she heard the girls talking about when they were playing yesterday at her house. And she was “appalled” (her words, not mine). Apparently, the girls were playing with barbies (yes, my 10 year old still plays with them occasionally). So, the appalling thing my daughter did was not call her family dolls grandmother, instead she called them abuela and babcia (hence the mention of Mora’s background earlier) one being Spanish for grandmother, the other Polish, that’s how she calls her grandmothers. And Mora’s new friend asked why and Mora explained it. And as kids, they continued playing.

Leah was distraught at the idea that my child doesn’t call her grandmothers, grandmas or nans or whatever else you’d called them in the US. I tried to politely explain to her our reasoning, but she went on a tangent how I am ruining my daughter’s future with messing up with her head, threatening to call CPS on me (yeah, she really said that) and that I am trying to brainwash her daughter into changing how she calls her grandparents (wtf?).

Anyway, I hate wasting my time on arguments and she clearly wasn’t in the right state of mind. I put the groceries down, told her ‘have a lovely day’ and walked back to my house.

I thought she might realise later what she’s done was wrong but no, she started telling all my new neighbours about the situation and she tried confronting me again. I told her to drop it and mind her own business, but she wouldn’t stop. I eventually called her a stupid twat and told her to never talk to me again.

He didn’t say anything but he also didn’t take it, so I just assumed he was stuck up. Me and everyone else did the lines and Dave just watched. Then me, my friends and Dave went to the club but that part isn’t really relevant.

He said that he’s a recovering addict and that even if he wasn’t, I shouldn’t have been pressuring him to take anything and doing lines in front of him just because I take it every day.

I live with my bf but he never planned anything and the only thing we are going to do is see Christmas lights on the evening of my birthday. Which he didn’t even come up with I even told him when I found out about it that it was going on for two days and the last one was my birthday. I found out I’ll basically be doing everything for myself on my birthday and all he was gonna do was fun time favors… I’m Asexual so that is about as appealing as getting a shot from a doctor. 
I figured if I’m paying for everything I might as well only pay for myself since the one person who’d I think would atleast plan to spend time with me would come up with atleast a $5 dollar cake or to cook me dinner. So I planned a day for myself of axe throwing, getting the free birthday stuff from places, and seeing the lights at the end of the night with him and then playing video games. So would I be the A hole for spending my birthday alone?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4809051,public,top,self,WIBTA if I spent my birthday by myself.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z088d1/wibta_if_i_spent_my_birthday_by_myself/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I live in a big city with lots of alleys. The city provides garbage cans, no individual owns the cans. Basically if the can behind my house is full then I can use any can in the alley. It's a good system that can be abused but my city is very clean compared to other cities of the same size. 

While the city is good about alley trash cans they're not so good about trash cans at the corners. So rather than just leaving poop bags everywhere considerate humans use the alleys. Garbage cans near mouths of alleys generally more filled with dog poop bags due to their proximity to the side walk. Trash pick up is very regular. 

So there's a older lady, at the end of the street. Wanna say about 50-60. She is a real piece to say the least. I've had prior issues with her over different matters. Anywho, I am dog sitting a friends stinky little boy for a week and for a such a tiny man he produces lots of reasonably sized poops

As we are walking today I have about 3 bags with me and we walk past her alley. There's another guy letting his pooch sniff around. So I go to the alley and dispose of these bags and like of of the God damn bushes this woman appears and goes on a tirade about how it's her trash can and she'll call the cops on me. Oh also it's fucking 20F degrees (-6C) outside so the fact that she's out there in the first place more or less to just to yell at people over this is pretty silly.

Maybe due to the cold I wasn't in the greatest mood. So I looked her dead ass in the eye as I put all the poop in one bag and then went over and dumped it in her yard. She lost it on me. I smiled and said ""Well you didn't want it in the trash"" and continued to walk with my the tiny gentleman. 

The guy with his dog burst out laughing and commended me for my malice. When I got home I kinda felt a little bad, but also I like hate this lady so there's that.

But I want to make sure that I'm not just being an asshole because sometimes my mom makes me feel that way.

It's so dumb, but this morning my mom and I were making centerpieces for our Thanksgiving dinner. She said out of nowhere, ""I hope you take Thanksgiving as seriously as I do when you're an adult"", to which I jokingly responded, ""It's not as special to me as it is to you."". She loves Thanksgiving. It's her favorite holiday. She goes all out and has a grudge against pretty much everyone who likes Christmas better (I'm guilty of this). 

She furrowed her brow and said, ""It doesn't matter. I will be like Nana is to Aunt Lisa, and complain if you don't put stuff out."" My nana (my mom's mom) is very particular and likes to remind my mom's sister (Aunt Lisa) that she doesn't decorate or go the whole nine yards as my mom does at holidays when she hosts. This part kind of made me a bit annoyed because I tell my mom she is constantly putting down her sister, and I don't want her to be that way with my brothers and me, and I also don't want her to foster weird competition between us.   


The real conflict started when I said, ""I don't know, I could have a box of pizza for Thanksgiving and be happy, and maybe I will, because it's more about the people you're with"". She looked flabbergasted and did a double take, then said ""I hope you're kidding me."" Then she said ""I won't be coming to Thanksgiving at your house in the future then."" DEAD SERIOUS.

I kind of was shocked, because I felt like this was a slight overreaction. So I said, ""It just isn't that important to me in a traditional sense - I like what it stands for, I just don't personally see the need to make a huge thing out of it,"" I could see she was still mad. I tried to tell her it wasn't that I was trying to trivialize something important to her, I just wanted to explain that I was trying to make the point that the accouterments of the holiday were not what was important to me when I thought about the future, it was more about the family.

So I got a bit tired of her yelling at me and saying ""The disrespect from my children is off the charts"" and ""Pizza from a BOX on thanksgiving? That's insulting!"". This is maybe where I went wrong, because I said to her ""If Thanksgiving really is that important to you, you wouldn't care if you were eating pizza because you'd be with your family."" I knew she would scream and possibly do more in response so I left to my room pretty much immediately.

I love my mom so much, I just get frustrated when simple conversations go down this path.

When we saw each other for the first time I could immediately tell that there was a curl pattern to his hair that he was basically ignoring. After we started dating, and during the pandemic, I encouraged him to start experimenting with products made for curly hair and voila! His hair is naturally very thick and curly, and he's very proud of it. Taking care of his hair is one of his favorite hobbies.

Because this transformation happened over the pandemic, a lot of people did not see the transition from damaged straight hair to thick curly hair. Our friends compliment him on it all the time, and it truly was a large enough change that he's had to re-introduce himself to people that didn't know him too well before.

All of that is setup and backstory. I don't know why, but as a joke, I like to tell people that he gets perms to make his hair curly. It's just for fun, and it's not like he knows about it so he isn't getting hurt by it. It's just like a little inside joke for me. I've told my friends and my parents this, and none of them question it because there really is a massive difference in his hair. This all came to a head when he came over to my house to meet my parents, and my mom asked him where he goes to get his hair done. He mentioned that he goes to a local barber to get his haircuts, and she clarified that she wanted to know where he got his hair permed. He was taken aback and after the confusion passed, he told her that his hair was natural, and the matter was dropped. They were both confused by it. After the meeting, my boyfriend remarked that it was so weird that she thought he got a perm, and she (my mom) asked why I told her he got one. I told her that he did but he was just insecure about it so he liked to tell people that it's natural.

When I came clean to my boyfriend about the jokes, he got really upset at me. He told me to stop lying to people to make him seem worse, and I don't get it because getting a perm really isn't that big of a deal. It wouldn't be bad if he did get a perm. I told him as much and he said that he didn't care, he wanted me to stop lying to people about him.

During college, I was renting a small house that I fully furnished. My at-the-time best friend, 27m (Chaz) graduated with me.  Chaz decided to buy a small house and wanted me to move in with him. His proposal was that I split the mortgage, and all utilities with him which was awesome because my monthly living cost would be cut by 50%. Chaz and I hung out regularly and both recognized we lived nearly identical home lives, so we both agreed it would be an ideal situation. 

**Where it begins:** about 6 months ago we started living together up to this point, he had lived a very minimalist lifestyle, so I supplied about 90% of the utensils, furniture, and other commodities around the house. One day I came home to find all my my items in a pile food, clothes, etc. Chaz said he didnt like where I had them and that I needed to find new places for them. This has become a weekly occurrence. Chaz has become completely unapproachable so I cannot talk to him about any of this. From that point forward Chaz begin creating a rule list I was required to follow, here are a few noteworthy rules/issues:

\- No items on countertops

\- No items in kitchen sink

\- No items on tables unless actively eating

\- No items in commonspaces (Xbox controller, TV remote, car keys, mail, must be barren of all items only furniture is permitted).

\- My bathroom has now been designated the guest bathroom which was against our initial agreement when we moved in. The guest would use whomevers bathroom that invited them over.

\- I must ask permission to have over guests, he does not

\- I cannot speak about how us living together is going, but he has been telling all of our co-workers how he feels its going

\- The house is quickly falling apart, having numerous issues, items such as the washer breaking, and several electrical outlets not working altogether and Chaz is refusing to fix any of them because he is tight on money right now (he just bought a $4000 watch).

**My response:** My parents live about 8 hours away, I decided to slowly move out all of my belongings beyond bare minimum. Chaz has relied heavily on my items and has damaged many of them. I can see that the house slowly emptying out  is stressing him out and causing him additional stress to his already stressful job, He uses the guest room regularly for his guests, which everything in the room belongs to me. I plan to remove the entire guest room. I am tired of walking on my toes (I actually do, he has a rule about walking as lightly as possible). I can't simply move out because it is on average a 2 year waitlist for any housing here. **AITA?**

I have been looking forward to having 4 days of nothing literally all year.

My 2 roommates (40s) are married, but are pretending to be separated on paperwork, so that they can both receive single person government assistance. When they combine it, it’s more than they would receive as a married couple. They also both get hundreds of dollars with government-provided free food cards. They refuse to work, and still make more than me.

When I get home, there’s always some kind of drama that they drag me into, which I think is more exhausting than my jobs. They sometimes want me to drive them around because they no longer have a car, and neither of them have licenses. I don’t want them to have to pay for an uber, so I agree to take them and it ends up being 3 hours because they’re half an hour late to leave, and keep adding places they want to go. And I did it to help them save money even though it cost me time, but then she tells me how she spent $600 on botox while I was at work. So apparently she was able to uber there.

I was also a bit annoyed when she asked me to go to her doctors appointments back to back and wait for her in the car (took all day while I had with to catch up on) but the second one was just for a cosmetic skin appointment she paid out of pocket for.

They make more money than me, by sitting home and pretending to the government that they’re separated. But then they still want me to drive them places to save them money on uber, but they will spend many hundreds of dollars on cosmetic stuff. 

It shouldn’t bother me what they do with their money. But they ask me to spend hours driving them around and waiting for them, to save them money, and then they spend money on things I wouldn’t be able to afford despite how much I work. 

I want to say no to driving them, but they say it’s for doctors appointments, they need to pick up this or that and don’t have a car. I have enough going on in my own life, I can’t have 2 adults depending on me to drive them around.

I know that they’re bothered I won’t let the husband just drive my car, but he doesn’t have a license so I could get in big trouble in something happened. And the wife refuses to get behind the wheel, doesn’t have a license either. 

I recently told them no to taking my roommate to go grocery shopping, pick up a medication, and pick up a package from their in law’s house. She said it’s wrong for me to not take her, because she needs her medicine. But the last couple times it took hours of time I couldn’t afford to lose from work, and she could uber.

Sam began making fun of Lucy’s accent, her “smell”, and especially the fact Lucy was an immigrant. I became very bothered by it and complained about it to Sam, who said the most baffling thing ever. “Um, btw, she used to comment on your hair and called it greasy and oily”.

This was the first time I’ve ever met one of his friends. We’ve been dating for 5yrs and he knows all my friends. 

I showed up as a surprise because I got off work early and he always said that he wished I could visit. He had office hours during that time so I was looking forward to just hanging out and maybe watching him teach. When I got there there was nobody in there accept K and they were just talking. 

He was surprised that I showed up but he introduced the two of us and it sort of awkward as though I was interrupting them because I was told that it was K’s bday and that they had plans after the office hours ended. He never mentioned that but if I had known I wouldn’t have shown up that day.

Anyway, this was technically his OHs so I thought it’d be fun to ask a few math problems (like long division) which ended up being funny because he couldn’t figure it out immediately. I teased him about it.

After OHs ended, we left and bf was like “we were going to see a movie if you want to join”. I didn’t want to third wheel their plans, so since they were parked a lot closer to campus than I was I said I’d walk to my car and let them know once I got there. Bf said he’d drive me to my spot, then K messaged him saying that a mutual friend to them called and made plans that night, so no movie. I felt really bad about that, since that ended up being made up.

I guess over the weekend, K messages bf about how she “hated that I was always putting bf down” and that she “didn’t like seeing bf get treated that way [by me]”. he showed me and was confused. I guess it was about me teasing about his inability to do long division. I was really upset because one 1) we are both very mutually sarcastic and make fun of each other 2) I had spent the previous day stressing out about making K disappointed about her bday so wtf. 

I was also more upset that bf did not defend me. All he said was “I think she was just doing that in front of you for some reason”. He didn’t disagree with her. He didn’t explain that that is how we joke around (god knows the kinds of things he has said to me). He didn’t tell her it was none of K’s business.

I pointed it out and he didn’t seem to care, that it didn’t matter. I told him the about times I’ve defended him with some of my people and why couldn’t he do the same? He eventually just said “we’re always sarcastic with each other so it’s fine” but only after I complained so it felt more like when a parent forces their kid to give an apology.

So this year my sister turned 40. This weekend we had planned to go for a meal. Her, my BIL, niece, myself, my fiance, and my 2 children along with a bunch of her friends. Sadly the day before one of my children fell ill. Followed the next day by the other so we couldn't go to said meal. 

I apologised and said they are vomiting and just not well. Her response was a short ""ok"". Not wishing them to get well soon or anything. My children are 2 (twins) and seem to pick up every bug around. 

I feel like I'm the bad guy here for not going as the children's health was more important. 

She told my Mum she can't grieve over my dad anymore before they stopped speaking and yet my sister had a picture of my dad at the table for this meal. (Noticed in pictures on social media) 

I feel like all she wants to do is fall out with me as well but I've done nothing wrong for her to do so. Now she sees this as her chance and is taking it totally the wrong way.

We have known both of them for about two years and they are both wonderful people to be around.

On Friday I am having a work lunch meeting with my team and a client in the downtown area of our city and I see Becky at the restaurant we are at with another man. Our group was just seated and she and the guy are leaving. I see them walk out the restaurant and she is holding onto his arm affectionately. The restaurant's dining room is surrounded by large windows so you can see outside into the street and vice versa. I see them both walk into a hotel across the street and disappear inside. My work lunch meeting ran for three hours and in that time I did not see either Becky or the guy leave the hotel. 

When I got home after work Friday I told my partner what I saw and he brought up that I should tell Chad. I told him I would think about it because while walking into a hotel with another man doesn't look good I don't know if it's a good idea to tell someone their partner is potentially cheating on them without more concrete evidence. I say this coming from a background where I've had an immediate family member be accused of cheating and it causing irreparable damage.

Yesterday night I called Becky and after some catch-up chit chat I told her I saw her on Friday. When she asked where I told her downtown at the name of the restaurant. She, with no hint of nervousness, said that I must have seen her with her cousin, Brian and that he was in town for a night on a business trip from the East coast and that that they haven't seen each other since before the pandemic lockdown. She then told me they were very close as they grew up together since childhood. I didn't stay on the topic after but casually asked if she and Chad were doing well relationship wise and she said they had their typical ups and downs but they are good. 

This morning I told my AARon about the call and he incredulously asked me why I called Becky instead of Chad. He further said I gave Becky time to prepare a story now if she was accused because she knows someone saw her. We kind of got into a bit of an argument about it. I told him I called Becky because she needs to talk to Chad if their is a problem going on in their relationship and I didn't want to call Chad and accuse Becky of cheating without more solid evidence. He urged me to call Chad and said I'd be an AH if I didn't tell Chad that his wife was potentially cheating on him. I do plan to call Chad and chat and see if he knew about Brian. AAron said it's too late for that because Becky probably preemptively told him about Brian now and that I need to just say that she may be potentially cheating on him and that I'd be an AH.

I (23m) had some friends at my apartment. We were talking about our thanksgivings plans and when we could meet before or after. I have a busy upcoming schedule though. I am doing friendsgiving on both Monday and Tuesday, then visiting my family for actual thanksgiving. Once I get back, I’m attending a birthday dinner the next week, then a wedding the next week, all while finishing projects and prepping for finals. Since I only have to work two weeks in December (I work at the university I attend and we have 3 weeks off for winter break) Im visiting friends out of state and already made plans for it. I won’t be back until the second week in January. 

It’s a busy schedule but it’s all stuff I want to do. I’m not too worried about school either. My projects are mostly done. My grades aren’t terrible but I still need to study. 

Here’s how my friend Jay (25m) reacted.

Jay: “So you’re not be around us at all?”

Me: “Probably not. There’s honestly just no time for it in the next month.”

Jay: “You can go to birthday dinner and wedding for people; I think you can make time for us.”

Me: “I’ll try but honestly it’s not likely. Other than the birthday and wedding, I’ll be spending all my time at work, on projects, or studying.”

Jay: “You can’t make plans for us (referring to all my friends I had over) but you can for people who you never mentioned to us beforehand? I know this is the first time some of us have even heard of some of those friends out of state.” 

Me: “Well yeah. I have different friend groups. Just cause I spend the most time with you guys doesn’t make the others any less important though.”

Jay: “I find it odd that some of these names you never brought up before. I can’t believe you’re not gonna hang with us for a while.”

Me: “I don’t have to announce who all my friends are. Some of them I haven’t seen in months. Some in a year. What are you upset about?”

Jay: “I just don’t understand why you can’t make plans for us too.”

At this point I told him he was acting jealous and insecure and that I can spend time with whoever I want. When I said that he stormed out my apartment. This morning I woke up to texts from a few people who were there and they agree I spend my free time how I want to, but not making any plans with them was hurtful and that I was harsh with what I said to Jay.

This has resulted in a mound of hand-me-down dolls in her room from her older cousins and friends, to which she was/is very happy about.

Yesterday, I found one of her dolls on the floor of the kitchen, which she has been told repeatedly to “*please* not do”, and, so—to remind her not to do so—I put the doll in a white dress she (the doll) owns, and, then, placing a few red, blue, orange, and yellow snips of paper I fished out of my hole-puncher on said dress. After, I put a flurry of blue cotton (that we already owned) over the doll’s hair as a type of ‘wig’, a pair of (blue) plastic shoes from Mary-Anne’s collection, and, to finish it off, I put a little bit of toothpaste (and a small piece of a red M&amp;M on the doll’s nose) on the doll’s face to act as a ‘white clown’s face’. Then, I wrote on a piece of paper ‘*don’t leave them in the kitchen!*’ and balanced it near the doll in Mary-Anne’s room, so she’d find it as soon as she entered.

Well, when she went upstairs today to play with her dolls, she screamed and started sobbing that I “ruined her doll!” and that it was “messed up forever!” As I started making my way to her room, my wife went past me and immediately arrived in Mary-Anne’s room to survey the doll.

Even after apologizing and cleaning the doll (making her look ‘normal’ again), my wife’s essentially called me an asshole for scaring our daughter so much, as she (Mary-Anne) has a slight tendency to overreact to minor issues/problems, which my wife believes I should have taken into consideration before.

He immediately professed his love for me, telling me he wanted to marry me. At my age, I found it romantic that he was so invested in me so quickly. Now I see it differently.

We instantly started getting some legal documents seeing as I am not in my country. We are in his. I spent a lot of money and time getting everything. I even had to involve my brother back home because I couldn't get the docs myself. In my culture we never introduce boyfriends so it was a big deal. 

After I got them, he didn't seem to want to move forward with our plans. He never looked up venues, suits, rings, nothing. I'm the only one who seemed to care. I told him multiple times to let me know if he didn't want to go through with it seeing as I had the opportunity to move to another country within 2 years. He insisted that he wanted to marry me and always got angry when I questioned him.

2 years later, as the deadline for me to make the decision to move neared, he FINALLY proposed officially. I was so excited and I could finally tell my parents about it because again, we don't do boyfriends in my culture. 
It was the happiest day of my life. I felt he had finally committed to me. I told everyone about it. But then it was all replaced with dread as again, he didn't make any plans. He never mentioned the wedding. He always acted like he didn't know that we were supposed to get married. 

It has brought me shame, disappointment and heartache. I'm kind of a people pleaser, and I feel so ashamed to tell people that I'm not getting married after all. I feel that that's a big reason why I stayed with him so long. I just don't want to tell everyone that I want to end things. I feel a lot of pressure to continue our relationship even though I've felt mentally checked out. I feel that in the eyes of everyone we are already married. Splitting up would be like a divorce and we don't do that either. 

This has taken a big toll on our relationship. The deadline to move passed and I was still stuck. I now feel stuck because it is hard for me to move with my passport (it is not very strong). This opportunity was the best thing I had. I've gotten the necessary documents 4 times now. I've had to spend ALL day in another city each time. Each time it goes to waste because he's not ready.

He acts as if we haven't broken up but we're just roommates IMO. I joined Badoo about 3 days ago.

To preface this, im 20(f) and my coworker is 23(m) 
I have no interest in actually pursuing a romantic relationship with him because I work with him and don't want to be irresponsible at work. 

However I developed a little crush on him, he's apparently just my type and is actually nice to me and doesn't treat me like a piece of meat like most other people I encounter do. I don't want to act on it or let him know about it but because it's possibly affecting my perspective here I thought it might be important to say. 

It just feels nice to be treated like a friend. 

He's expressed interest in being my friend (sounds robotic but we play video games together and talk outside of work often is what I mean) which is also something I don't experience often as people usually just want to lead me on for a few weeks until they eventually confess that they just wanted to sleep with me and ghost me when I say no, or if that wasn't the case they just lose interest within a similar time frame and stop talking to me. 
(I'm not the best people picker and don't have alot of friends if you can't tell) 


Buuuut we work retail so the seasonals are coming in and there was a new girl. She's really cool and I actually do want to be her friend too so my issue isn't at all with her. 

I noticed that he took way more time in training her than me when I started, he was nicer, took more care about it and was overall trying to stick to her and didn't let me talk as much as he usually did by directing conversation towards her. (I'm a quiet person so this is more noticeable because he usually wants to listen to what I have to say if I want to say something) 

another thing that came up was I asked if he wanted to go to an event with me in a few months and previously (id asked a few days prior) he was very excited to go and said he would, but while we were working with the new girl, he said  ""I'll have to think about it"" when I brought it up again because it's coming up soon. 
Obviously he doesn't *have* to go with me, it's fine if he changes his mind but it stings a bit if he only said that for the new girl...

He also made fun of me, my intelligence and my looks (all things he knows I'm very insecure about and he's never made fun of me in those areas because he knows that) more often and way more harshly than usual and was just, very different. 

Idk exactly if it's jealousy that he started ignoring me and was very mean in favor of being nice to a new girl and I'm just being weird or if there's something else going on.

I asked my daughter if she cheated and she said no.

I told the teacher that unless she has proof that my daughter cheated then I don't think she should be punished and she was bullying my daughter and my daughter was just defending herself so I won't punish her for that.

My classmate's directing a 7 minute film. He held auditions this week and wants to show it by June. We go to a school where everyone lives far away from each-other and makes meeting outside school hard.

&amp;#x200B;

I audition for 2 roles: supporting and the protagonist. Classmate considers everyone auditioning for the protagonist role and told us he'd give results on Friday. He's very secretive about what the film is about, the script, filming dates and times for dramatic effect.

On Friday, the last round of auditions began and he asked who would bring them to the filming set (his home which is the furthest school buses go for students and 1hr from me). He explained that we'd have to go to his house at 4:30am for a scene and several other scenes for an entire month at his house. I was really confused bcI knew my parents wouldn't drive for hours for me to film for an hour after working all week; I wouldn't have auditioned if I'd known. He tells me in the same convo that I may be protag if I confirm that I'd be free during the winter break to film. I asked for specific dates and times but he said he had none, but I'd have to confirm right now if I wanted to be the main role. I said i'd confirm tonight since I need to talk to my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

That night, he added everyone who auditioned in a group chat. He asked confirmation about who's showing up to the 1st 2 shootings: a 4:30am scene at his house and a 7:00am scene at school that same day during the break. He still doesn't give a date. We ask who got which roles and he also replies that no one is decided unless someone confirms they can film at those times. He listed more demands and that should've been the sign. I tell him that I'm not sure if i'll be out of town for the holidays but needed a date to be sure. I got casted as supporting role and asked why. He answered with ""your availability is what is creating problems here"". I got annoyed and said how it's impossible for me to confirm anything without proper info and context. + we know nothing about the movie which would let us find solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

here's when it gets bad. He starts sending 10 dates for filming during December including the 24th and the 25th of December. Everyone is shocked at this because it's insane: Christmas eve and Christmas day to film?. He's Indian and doesn't celebrate but in this country where Christmas begins in September and he lived here for years, he knows how big of a deal Christmas is. His reason for filming on Christmas was that we'd still be able to spend time with our families after filming. After people complained about this, he said he'll change the 25th to the 31st instead, aka New Year's Eve.

Grace really only comes to stay on the weekends since she’s in college, and this time she brought her boyfriend Issac (21m) with her.

I’m biracial, my dad is white and my mom is black. Honestly I don’t look anything like my dad so most people don’t even think I am mixed. We like to joke that I got his personality instead of his looks.

People tend to say offhanded stuff to me about how I don’t look the way they think I’m “supposed to”. I’m kind of used to it especially since my dad ended up married to a woman that is also white so like every time I’m with them it obviously looks like I’m the odd one out. I’m not afraid to correct people, but sometimes that gets exhausting and I’ll just play dumb instead.

Grace and I had planned to get lunch together and her bf Issac ended up coming along with us. She wants him and I to get to know each other better since she really likes him, so I figured that’s why she brought him.
While we were having lunch, my mom’s side of the family was brought up, and then Issac said that it must’ve been a shock to my dad at least for me to end up so dark since most mixed kids are lighter in complexion than I am. But then he said that at least I ended up with “good hair” so I didn’t lose out completely.

Grace didn’t speak up and say anything to him about it, so I pretended not to understand what he meant and asked what was so good about my hair and what it was he thought I was losing out on anyway.
He got flustered and said “well you know…most girls with your skintone have curlier hair.”
So then I asked why he thought my hair was good just because it wasn’t that curly. He said he felt it just looked nicer. So I asked why he thought that textured hair didn’t look just as nice. He kept blubbering out excuses and digging the hole even deeper for himself, and finally Grace told me to cut it out and leave him alone.

I paid for my part of lunch and left after that. I didn’t tell my dad or Hannah what happened, but it’s obvious enough that Grace is mad at me. My dad asked that she and I solve whatever the problem is, because he hates seeing us be so tense around each other.

Grace ended up telling me that she was pissed because I made her boyfriend look like a jerk by playing dumb. I told her that I didn’t have to make him look like a jerk because he already was one, but she said that I drew the problem out more than necessary and made it worse than it needed to be when I could’ve just told him that he f’ed up.

I mean I could have done that, but I don’t think it should be my job to, and plus I feel like it was probably more effective to get him to explain his logic outloud rather than have me tell him he was being a jerk.

Well, recently, after Joana walked through the door, she told me that she asked Jocelene why she “didn’t have a dad”, to which Jocelene replied with, “he lives in China due to my parent’s divorce.” Then, Joana asked, “why did he dump your family instead of living near you?”

According to Joana, Jocelene didn’t seem to mind the question, though I’m still not proud of her wording or her (private) question, as she’s only known Jocelene for what seems like a week or two, and—due to such—I gave her a stern lecture and told her to try to be more respectful of someone else’s family-life, as some people may not be as open to telling her as Jocelene was, and that they could even feel insulted by her invasiveness.

Well, Joana essentially told me that I was being an asshole, and that Jocelene didn’t even seem to care about her question(s), so—therefore—I was just “being unfair/mean”.

While I understand that she was likely just annoyed with me, I still feel that her thoughts are worth a minute’s consideration, and so I may as well ask for someone else’s insight on the matter.

TW: child abuse

I’m (27F) stopped all contact with my dad and step mom after 9 years of severe abuse. I’m still in therapy, I still see the permanent scars, and I’m still quite frankly haunted by what they did. But around my family, I can put on a smile and act like it never happened since they would rather keep contact with my dad and pretend it never happened. 

I was raised by my grandparents after them fighting to obtain custody of me. I love they raised me and they did their damn best to ensure my success. The holidays have always been my grandmas time to shine and host. After she died, everyone dismantled and my aunt (who’s my god mother) and I just couldn’t bring everyone together like my grandma could. 

For context: my family would rather not acknowledge my abuse besides my grandma. I think it’s more of a comfort thing and to actually hash it out, everyone has to admit their brother, uncle, son actually hurt a living human being. I can empathize to an extent even when that human is me. 

Fast forward a few years later, I’ve been at peace not talking to my dad for a few years. But my aunt has completely excluded me from all family activities. This year, they said my dad was coming down for thanksgiving knowing I wouldn’t come if he was there. My gpa (her dad is in the hospital). She said it’s bc my dad is worried it’s his last year. But I find out he was never coming. 

WIBTA for calling out the exclusionary behavior and lack of respect for my boundaries? For them, it’s better to act like my dad and step mom never abused me and just leave me out. Me calling this out, would result in a heated argument that there’s no going back from. It’s the holidays and I may be doing a disservice to my grandmothers memory.

Lets call her K, K and I have been best friends since high school and we’ve always been buddy buddy. We used to talk every day She lived with her abusive family and when we would hang out we would have fun and get away from all the bad at home. 
That stopped when I went to college three years and she stayed at home with her family, but I would come back on breaks and we would pick up right were we left off. During my time in college we would also text and talk a lot about anything and everything. 
Unfortunately, as of late it seems as though our conversation have grown dull and one sided, K only responds with one word replies or something of little substance. 
Last night, after a long drive, I finally made it back home for break and I immediately texted K letting her know I was in town. She didn’t seem excited or that she even cared at all. I asked K if she  cared or wanted to see me and she replied “I didn’t know you wanted to hang out”. I was a bit hurt by this response as looked to my grandmother, who I stay with when I come home, for guidance. I have a message typed out and ready to go but not sent, and I read it off to my grandmother. 

“No, it’s fine, really. You just let me know if you want to do anything or if you be an active participant in our friendship. Of course I wanted to hang out! I always want to see you when I am in Tennessee. But you’ve gotten so passive and we barely talk and when we do you give one word answers or act as if you don’t want to talk to me. Our conversation rarely are of any substance. So from now on *you* can come to me if *you* want to do something. I want to be friends with someone who *wants* to be friends with me, not have a friend who is so passive and feels as though they aren’t even there or don’t care.”

Basically, my grandmother says that it would be petty for me to try and talk it out, rather I should just ignore her and leave her be. After reading it out loud to her I agree that the first part does sound kinda petty, and fully intend to fix it and clean it up, but my grandmother thinks I shouldn’t say anything at all.

Like, for instance, the other day, she informed me and my class that it was time to turn in our reports on the Great Wall of China, which my entire class agreed that she had never told us about (nor had she put it on her Canvas page, where she’s supposed to post our assignments).

So, while I respect her, yeah, she isn’t wonderful (academically). The other day, though, she was talking to my class when she slipped in that it was time to turn in our review-sheet regarding Chinese language. When my class asked her what she was talking about, though, she told us that—last Monday—she had assigned us a *fifteen-page* review booklet about China/Chinese, and that it was due that day (and worth *40%* of our grade). When my class started to tell her that she had never assigned us that (which they were right about, may I add—she hadn’t added it to her page, on the board, given us the booklet, or even *told* us about it), she told us all to stop talking and that we were just trying to dodge our consequences due to us—all *thirty-two* of us—-not having done a sliver of the work.

Eventually, she said that the next person to protest would be sent to the principal’s office, which managed to shut everyone up. Eventually, though, I became annoyed and stood up from my seat, saying something along the lines of how she had “never assigned us it” and how our grades had been “dropping to seventies” due to her continuous mistakes. I even went as far as to say that was literally “manipulating us” into thinking that we were doing something wrong, even though it had always been her fault, over and over again.

Well. I’m still facing punishment for my outburst, but I’m still annoyed due to my situation, so—even though it doesn’t mean anything at this point—I would appreciate your feedback on my debacle, as everyone seems to think I was/am the asshole.

We have been best friends since I was 14.  I'm 30 now.  We have talked about me being one of her bridesmaids for years.  She wants one of those dream weddings and wants me there for it.

So...there are a few reasons.

First, I still wear masks.  She has outright said I'm ""stupid"" and ""an idiot"" for still wearing a mask, on two separate occasions, and I know she would want me to take the mask off for the whole thing which would make me exceptionally uncomfortable.

She had specifically said my partner of nearly eight years can't come.  She can come to the resort, but not the wedding, because she doesn't want them getting into arguments with others.  They don't get along.  My best friend has the right to exclude people, sure, but it's specifically targeted.  She also said she doesn't want to pay for a seat at the wedding, which would be $100.  But they said my partner could come to the resort...which would just involve them staying inside for the most part.

I'm pretty much broke right now and the cost of airfare plus a passport for this alone is a large expense (for me personally, probably not for others).

Speaking of which, the resort is in a foreign country where I don't speak the language and the resort is an hour away from the airport.  I recognize this is probably a stupid thing to say but I'm not used to traveling outside my country (US) and have only spent two days in Canada.  Trying to navigate getting there and sticking out as a foreigner is going to make me feel exceptionally awkward and like a ""fish out of water.""  Naturally other people are going to do it just fine but I'm not used to dealing with language barriers.

And a tiny fifth point.  Although I highly doubt something will happen, the country doesn't have the best safety record and my partner is very worried something will happen to me.

So...four major reasons,

Being called stupid for wearing a mask and knowing she won't want me wearing one.

My partner being specifically excluded

Financial issues getting there.

Anxiety about being in a foreign country where I don't speak the language (like I said, I haven't traveled much).

And smaller fifth being my partner's anxiety about something happening to me.

And I guess a sixth one too is worrying about losing our friendship if I don't go.

So basically my (16M) bf (18M) has been asked to go to a funeral by one of his football coaches. WHICH HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO. But his couches are known to pick favorites. He has told me already he's not going because he doesn't like the idea of it, and would never have asked people that didn't know HIS mother to go to her funeral when she died. I can post evidence of him not wanting to go to the funeral in the comments maybe if you feel you need that.

I do understand how a football team can be like family, but they are not. And the fact that (and this will probably happen) they probably will not play him in a game if he doesn't go to the funeral. Which I feel is unprofessional and extremely inappropriate, which I voiced this to him but I really do want opinions. I asked my mom and she had just yelled at me because she believed that it wasn't disrespectful or inappropriate. And I guess thats to each their own but I know I personally wouldn't wat people I didn't know at my funeral just because someone else didn't want to be alone.

And while yes they are 17-18 and can make their connections with their couch, if it was 17-18 women with a male couch wanting them to come to an event, controlling whether or not they'd play in the next game or not, the couch would be arrested or at least fired. And I just don't see it at all appropriate or professional to manipulate players to go to a funeral based on whether or not you'll let them play the next game.

i, 23f, want to leave my fiancé 24m. we have a daughter together, 1.5m, which makes this a bit complicated. we’re both still in school, financially intertwined, and live together. 
and we’re really happy, except for one issue. he has a porn addiction. as a girl who’s been cheated on a lot in the past, i made it clear that a boundary of mine was that i didn’t want someone of mine to look at other girls naked. he said this was understandable, and we moved past it. to at least try to keep it brief, i caught him watching porn behind my back about 4 times. i addressed it each time. 

postpartum, it really hurt my feelings. i struggled with body image and catching him doing that made me feel so bad about myself, as if i wasn’t enough. 

the last time this happened was about a year ago, and i thought he actually was done. but lately i’ve been getting really weird feelings from him. he’d stay in the bathroom forever and basically just block himself out for hours at a time. i quite honestly thought he was cheating, so when he was asleep i went through his phone. everything was clear until i went to his private browser. so so much porn. and at this point it felt like a lost cause. 

i’m aware that it’s just porn, but it’s a boundary i set. and it constantly being disrespected is making me think this won’t work. into the issue: i want to leave. my parents are going to suspect ab*se if i randomly decide to call off the wedding which could unnecessarily escalate the situation, so i think the best option is to tell them the real reason i’m coming home.

I don't like answering her calls because I know it's just another favor. Don't get me wrong, for the most part they're legitimate, but it still gets annoying. As an example this past week she asked me to babysit her kids because she forgot they had a half day and due to required school and work commitments neither she nor her husband could make it, the prior week she needed me to drive her kids and husband to school and work, before that one kid was sick and she asked me to watch him on my day off.

What are we doing? Don't we understand how stressed she is right now? She whines about the fact that NOBODY ever offers to help her, she has to beg us for help. My mom and I end up helping out the most but it is just too much. 

Since the majority of the requests she makes are child related I want to get her a gift card for a babysitting/nanny service. The problem is that I am sure that she will take this as me not wanting to watch her kids (it's not, I love my nibblings I would just prefer scheduling time to be with them, when I want to see them rather than when my sister needs me). It would greatly help me be able to schedule what I need to do on my days off, without constantly having to change my plans. It would also mean that I wouldn't be forced to see her each week, I could go a few weeks without her and when I do see her, I won't be resentful of having to drop everything to help her. I think it would be great for our relationship, but I am pretty sure that she will get angry and stop talking to me.

Also, she has made no attempt to find babysitters in her area, probably because when we were young, my mom was broke and hired babysitters that were just bad. But I think that if she took some effort to research them and maybe set up a nanny cam it would reassure her that her kids are safe.

So, mel and Will are best Friends , and Will is in jake’s band . 

Jake is my boyfriend.

Lee was one of my best friends until two years ago i presented him to mel and they started dating. 

I always though that mel was my friend and we bonded because both had Been in abusive relashionships . Oh boy how i was wrong…. In conclusion she triggers me a lot, she always tries to make me inferior, she bad mouths me, alway saying stuff that aint real, there was one time that she would call me like with some New drama that she would come up to guilt tripping me and shouting , i got to a point where for me to be with my best friend Lee, i had to Walk in egg Shells and actually everytime i would have a pânic attack. 
So yesterday i was at a party, very far away from home and it was 3 am. I saw that lee , Will , mel and another friend where in wills car, and i went over to as if will would give me a ride , i knocked at the window, and she didnt open the window , and Will made a face like “my bad “ and drove away. I was kind of shoked tbh, i don’t feel entitled for a drive back home , but at least he could say no or something. 

So here ir where i might a be the AH, i know if i tell my bf Jake, he will not like it, and most probably get out of wills band.

I asked if there was any way she could leave early (very flexible and no she doesn't lose any pay) and watch the kids. MIL said she had a client coming in and couldn't. i said I totally understood.

Then her boss ripped the phone out of her hand and told me she ""must be confused"" She doesn't have a client and she isn't doing anything so of course she can leave early. I was immidiatley uncomfortable and heard MIL mutter fuck you. He said MIL would love to babysit he ""can see it in her face"" and then he was like ""aww she is so excited""

MIL took the phone back and had the fakest smile. She said that she had the days mixed up and she can come over. I said no she clearly doesn't want to, I don't need her pity, and my kids don't need to be around someone with an attitude. She said I was being childish and she would come over. she hung up. I was furious and ended up getting someone else. 

MIL showed up right as I was leaving and told me it was fine and she could babysit, but I snapped at her that I'm not a charity case and I don't like her attitude. She called me childish and I told her to get out of my driveway and my kids don't even like her as she's fake and has bad energy.

My best friend hates me and I don’t know what to do

This story all started last year when I (F)celebrated my 14th birthday in December

I invited my best friend at the time 13F, we’ll call her jessica, to my bridal party party. I invited her two weeks prior to the event I had planned and she was the only one invited.

At first everything was fine however a week leading up to the party she started ignoring completely. This isn’t something I made up in my mind either, she would talk with my friends we sat in a group but when they left jessica immediately shut down. This continued for the entire week until I was able to get out of her why she was upset.

She told me that her and her family planned to go to a Christmas show on the day of my birthday party. I at the time was super obsessed with making her as happy as possible. I told her I would work out with my parents to move my party to the next day. after I told her that she became a lot happier and started talking to me again.

I went home and tried to talk to my parents and see if we could change it however I was unable to because of the times they had work. I then texted jessica this.

The next day rolled over and my parents and I spent the entire day setting up the party but an hour before jessica was set to arrive her mother contacted my mum and cancelled. Things got hectic after that, my mum panicked and screamed how it was my fault because I tried to change the times then I started crying which made her more panicked. My mum spent most of that hour on the phone trying to work something out however jessica was set on cancelling. My mum then got really mad and starting insulting Jessica’s mother.

The next day my mum was able to rearrange and jessica came over for a sleep over that night.i thought that everything was fine but it got worse after that. Jessica then told all of our other friends about how my mum had been a bitch to her mum and made them all believe I was a bitch. The next two weeks of school they all ignored me.

The next school year started and for the first full semester jessica blocked me out completely. Thing have gotten better recently however we now work at the same place and I’m starting to realise how much she actually hates me. At school I’m pretty much her only person to hang out with but at work she has other friends and when I’m around she completely ignores me just like she did that week leading up to her birthday and she only talks to me when all of her other friends are gone.

I don’t know what to do, her presence and attention is so addicting. I know if I confront her she’ll take all of my other friends with her because she’s so popular and I’ll be left with absolutely no one. I have no idea what to do, especially because my 15th birthday is coming up and dragging all of these memories up.

I 20 M have been dating my 22 F girlfriend for about 5 months. One of her friends recently broke up with her bf and so they went out drinking and her friend is feeling this guy so they take him and his friend back to my girlfriends house, they then separate and she told the guys friend that she has a boyfriend and tries to just talk to him, he ends up kissing her she pushes him off tells him she's not interested he does this again same thing then says something like don't tease me. Then holds her down on the couch my gf wrestled away and then went to her friend and told her she needs to go to bed so the dudes have to go.
Now she told me this the next morning and I have not tried getting information but urged for his name told her its a good idea to do something so that this guy doesn't go and do worse things to other girls. She's distant takes long time to message me back whatever I understand she's been through something traumatic. And I feel super shitty for wanting to ask why she brought two dudes back why her friend couldn't just go home with the one dude. But also I could just be brewing this all in my mind because I can't talk to her because I don't want to victim shame but I still feel hurt and I'm bottling it all inside and I don't know what to do. She obviously doesn't want to talk about it and I haven't asked to I just want to so bad but I know it's wrong and I feel like an asshole for the feelings I have but I just don't get why she didn't tell him to leave after 1 kiss or even 2 and why they went back to her place like I just wouldn't do that with another girl it just makes me feel sick inside.
