My sister (F28) and I (F25) used to get along very well, we still do sometimes but it isn't as before. She was always difficult to handle and stubborn but nothing that I hated.

My sister developed allergies and quit her job in 2019 and hadn't worked since, We moved into our apartment in 2021. I started working after my graduation getting minimum wage late 2020 and have been the sole provider since then, my dad chips in to help with my medicine.

We visited our mom in a different country recently and decided to stay for 5 months.  I paid for the rent (5months in advance) and pay 90% of the household expenses and got a Wi-fi installed to keep up with my work. We split household chores to cooking and cleaning, she cleans once a week and I cook everyday.

My sister has been really selfish and self-centered recently, ever since she saw my mom she started acting like a child, I would ask her to watch the dish on the stove for a few minutes to take a quick shower or get something else done and she would say:  ""take care of your own chores, do you see me asking you to do mine?"". She would ask for money and I would ask her to get me snacks on her way home and she would get herself something and not me or she'll only get what she likes and the amount that suits her only.

Today was the final straw, I had a long tiring shift, I asked my mom to cook the lunch since I didn't have time, didn't even eat my lunch properly and by the time I was done (7PM) I was starving, I went into the kitchen and found out my sister bought my favorite bread filling (which usually comes with bread) and no bread! I asked her and she said laughing ""yeah... I got 3 breads, I gave one to our cousin and ate two since I was hungry"" I asked her why would she eat my share or at least didn't get more bread so I could have an extra bread, she said why should I? and told me to make my own bread if I was that hungry. Mind you this usually becomes dinner if we buy it, we don't cook if there is bread and filling. My mom told her she was being very selfish, knew I've been working all day and starving and she could've been considerate and get me an extra loaf of bread or not eat mine. She said she was hungry end of the story, mom told her to fix me something for being an ass, she ignored my mom and went into her room.

I went in her room screaming about how selfish she is and kept asking her why wouldn't she just buy enough bread for everyone, she told me to lay off her, and to stop screaming about food since it's pathetic, I lost it and told her she only knows how to eat not think and well since she's so happy eating the food why won't she get the person making the money their food? at least do something useful.

I felt terrible after saying that, I felt like I went overboard and I was being petty over money when it wasn't the issue in the first place.

I have a big mortgage, but I let my girlfriend pay a cheap rent as she is currently a student with low income. She pays about half of what I could’ve gotten if I rented out the extra bedroom to someone else. 

The interest on my mortgage has increased and I don’t have a lot of money left each month after paying all my bills, even though I have a decent salary. So, I told my girlfriend I was thinking about renting out the apartment on AirBnb in periods where we are not home. Mainly vacations and weekends when we are both away somewhere. This would help my economy a lot. I told her she doesn’t need to worry about anything regarding cleaning or practicalities. I would most likely use a business that fixes everything and makes sure the apartment looks like nobody was there before we come back. But she would need to put some of her stuff away in the basement.

When I told her my plan, I wasn’t expecting her to get angry and tell me she didn’t want that to happen. She say she doesn’t want random people living in our home and sleeping in our bed. I can see that point, but I would buy extra bedsheets for the guests and everything would be clean and fresh every time she came home. I also got mad and said she couldn’t refuse because of her cheap rent and that this was a way for me to earn back what i loose on our agreement.

For reference, it is a top that goes in a set and retails for $350 so is reasonably expensive. I really wanted it for something special (this Friday) and she just wanted it in general. 

She bought a size that she felt was too big for her. The top has been sold out for months, however I managed to track down the last one available in my size (with A LOT of time and effort). I ordered the top and all was good. She found out I had found my size and was quite passive aggressive with me saying that she “wanted it first” etc. I offered to swap sizes with her as I didn’t think the bigger one would make too much of a difference. 

It took her weeks to drop her top off and when she did it smelt like cigarettes and perfume. At this point I was regretting my decision. At no point did she say thank you or that she really appreciated what I had done. 

I tried her size on and it was very clearly way too big for me. I text her and said it was too big and that she could return it for a refund and she could pay me for the size I gave her. I was hoping she would refuse and just give me my top back but she said I could “borrow it” for this weekend. (I still haven’t received any money from her so don’t see how I can borrow something that is technically mine). 

I didn’t want to argue over a top so I said I would drop her top back at the post office for her so that she receives her refund and she can pay me for MY top.

I do not have many friends, so when my birthday comes, I usually awkwardly sit with some family members I dislike and smile through it. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, this year I decided just to ignore all the family members asking me if I were going to celebrate my birthday or let them off with a simple ""no"". One of my aunts seemed to accept that but my other family members were enraged. For example, my other aunt tried to force me to go out to dinner. A kind offer, really, but I simply do not want to be with my family and due to my anxiety, I simply do not want to be in a restaurant. I once again said no and she kept pushing other ideas. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another example would be my sister (F23). I got a birthday card in the mail today (my birthday is this Sunday) so I posted it on my story. Said something along the lines of ""A bit early but birthday cards are next level"" because it was kind that people still give me stuff for my birthday (I do not get a lot most of the time, half of my family members say they will show up and then forget or they just forget my birthday overall and honestly, I'm the type you could make happy with a rock. I'm not that hard to satisfy.) She got all mad at me, telling me I was ungrateful for making a comment about a birthday card being early. She was the only person I was looking forward to seeing on my birthday, the only one I actually invited so that means my sister won't even be there to celebrate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then we have my mother calling me an asshole for not wanting to invite her (I live with my grandparents) because she put me in this world and it would only be fair to have her there. The thing is. They always come to my birthday, end up arguing with each other, eat the cake and the snacks and leave. I have the feeling they don't come for me, but for themselves. I am aware that sounded a bit selfish but in the end, it's my birthday and every year they ended up ruining it. So I finally decided to just not invite anyone and get so much hate for it.

I understand he can’t control his body when asleep but I feel he should do something to stop this, because if he was awake then it would be abusive. We then got in a screaming match about how I’m an asshole for calling him abusive and being insensitive.

I (36f) moved to a different country 6 years ago.  Its a long flight and extremely expensive to come home to visit my family.  This is the first time I have been able to come home since covid.  

Some background information.  My parents have been seperated since I was 2.  My mum and I are extremly close.  I did try to live with my dad when I was younger but it never worked out very well.  I didnt really fit in with his wife and her kids.  My dad and I have never been very close but I did and do try to see him when I can.  Since I moved my dad has made no effort to come visit me.  Most text messages and phone calls are instigated by me on birthdays and holidays. 

I am home for 2 weeks this time.  I have spent the whole time with my mum. I flew in to where she lives and then we drove the 12 hours together to my oldest brothers house. 

My dad, his wife, my sister and her daugher and sister in law and her daughter came down on saturday for Thanksgiving.  My dad also brought his two dogs.  The whole time he spent dealing with the dogs and sitting in another room from everyone because he was upset with my SIL about something. 

My dad was supposed to come back for thanksgiving to see me for another day, but has hurt his shoulder and doesnt think he can manage the trip and the dogs with the pain he is in.

So this happened 3 years ago. It was second date for me and my then boyfriend will call Pete. Pete had planned for him and I do a bar crawl for mardi gra. For thoes who don't know, a bar crawl is where you give them money and they give you discount/free drinks at different locations at certain times through out the night. I live in San Diego, and downtown is a nightmare to navigate at night on the weekends. 

I had worked 8 hrs before the crawl, i work as a certified nursing assistant. My day started at 6:30 a.m. and ended at 2:30, but i'd sometimes stay over till 3 or 4 just charting everything. After work, I went straight home to get ready, and drove back to his place, it's closer to downtown then my house is, for a ride down to downtown, which i paid for. The only meal I had was at 11 and so when we got down there the first bar had a taco bar. So Pete and I both got two mini tacos and drinks. Then proceeded to get drinks from other bars. I'm not a big drinker, but Pete had a happy buzz after the a few drinks. He kept asking me if I was, ""having fun"" every few seconds, which I said I was.

I started to get hungry and asked if we could find somewhere to eat. Pete said yes, but that he wanted to eat at particular bar. Well we walked around looking for  it and stopping at bars that wasn't that particular bar along the way. He was still on his happy high asking a stranger to smoke his joint and giving beads to two hostess at the resturant podium. We had a map and tried using my phone to get us this particular bar, but no such luck. 

We finally find this particular bar, and at this point I'm tired and hangry because it took us a long time to find this place. We get in and I got to the bar to grab water.I am standing off to the side not dancing or anything, but people watching. Pete gets mad and tells me to act like I'm having fun. So I tell him I'm not.

He then pulls me out of the bar and scolds me on the sidewalk. Tells me he spent alot of money on these tickets, $70, and that I am ungrateful for all his efforts. We then head back his place, and I paid for the ride back his place. The next day he acted all cold to me. When I did apologize for acting like bitch.

Please tell me if I'm just being hormonal or if this actually makes sense. 

Originally the plan was to have my partner and my mother with me during labor and delivery. I am permitted 2 people in the room per hospital policy. Well, last month my mother got arrested for a domestic violence charge. She's a functioning alcoholic. She got too drunk and physically hurt her boyfriend. It was stressful. She needed my help getting bail and since she was kicked out of her house because they broke up, she also needed my help getting a new place and moving. Fine. Got that all done. 

Well since then she has kinda gone a little wild in my opinion. She's calling off work regularly to party and bar hop with random men, and she admitted to me she has done an illegal substance a couple times. I am not a judgemental person, but this has worried me some. I don't want to tell anyone how to live, so I've kept my thoughts to myself and just told her to stay safe. 

Well, now it is Thanksgiving week and I've found out she has no intentions of coming to visit me (she lives an hour away) for the holiday. She has time off work to visit, but instead plans on partying with her new friends. I've had a tough time with this pregnancy lately and really need my support system. And she's just not there for me. I'm upset that she's choosing to party instead of come see me or arrange for me to go see her. I feel hurt and abandoned. 

Now I'm considering not having her at the birth because it just seems like she doesn't really care anymore. I expressed this to my partner and he thinks I may be jumping the gun or taking this too personally. Would it be wrong for me to tell her she's no longer welcome at the birth of her grandson? Am I being selfish? I know I don't own her time and she doesn't have to come see me for the holiday. But we hardly see each other and I feel like it's important. Am I being hormonal and butthurt? I don't want to make a rash decision. I know telling her she can't be there will cause a lot of drama. And I do really wish I could have her support during labor. But I also feel like she is putting distance between us and I don't know if I want her there while there are these feelings. But for months now I have been telling her she can be there.

In hindsight I should have said something right then in there but I was feeling selfish that moment because I didn't want to draw attention to her on what was supposed to a special day.  
A few days later they came to our house to discuss having their wedding reception in our garage and it was then that I brought up how I felt. 
I explained how their actions were disrespectful and tasteless. That they not only made me feel uncomfortable but also my guests. The issue was not everyone that attended the reception was invited to her baby shower. I further explained that we, the bride and groom, weren't even invited and that should have just mailed her invites or asked us if it was OK to hand them out. 
I was told by my daughter in law that ""It wasn't a real wedding. Since this was just the reception and some of guests in attendance were invited to her baby shower, she would save on postage since they were planning their own wedding. It's not that big of deal because her side of the family does this type of thing all the time. Her mom told her it wouldn't be rude.If I was really that upset I should have said something that day.

We speak on the phone every day and try to meet up for dinner at least once a week. I’ve always had a great relationship with both of them and never want to do anything to upset either of them.

So I(25f) have had a very hard year. You can see from the other posts on my account but the TLDR is that I’ve had a lot of unexpected medical expenses and diagnosis’ that have really derailed my life plans. My parents have stood by me through all of it and are helping me with a large portion of my medical debt. 

As hard as this year has been for me it’s been ever harder for my mom. She lost my grandma/her dad to Covid in 2020, and my great aunt/her aunt in 2021. Our family is VERY close and these deaths greatly impacted our family. Currently my grandma/her mom is going through health issues and it doesn’t look good. She has been her main caretaker and has curved her entire life around watching and caring for her mom. She’s at the hospital/rehab center with her from 9am-10pm most days. She visits her EVERY DAY. She tells me often how hard and tired she is and how frustrating it can be caring for someone with onset dementia.

I really want to do something nice for her and give her a chance to be taken care of since she has run herself ragged taking care of our family. Since one of my surgeries got postponed, I have the ability to use that money to take her out to a Broadway show! I floated the idea to her but she got nervous saying she wanted to go just us; but couldn’t because of my dad. 

My dad is also amazing and they have a wonderful relationship… but very codependent. They are ALWAYS together and I know that she really needs a break. They’re opposites attract and she often doesn’t get to do things SHE wants to do. 
I’d love to take her into the city; get some drinks; maybe try a little “gummy” at the show with her and just let her RELAX. That wouldn’t be possible if I also brought my dad: since he is very strict about schedules, high stress when it comes to taking a train into the city, and he is a “square” (his own words) when it comes to medicinal ways to relax. 

My original idea was to buy the tickets for just me and my mom and “force” it so that it’s just us to ensure she gets the break she needs: but I don’t want to upset my dad!

My boyfriend and I are nineteen and have been dating since we were fourteen in March of 2018. We've never had a falling out, a break, or anything. It's always been perfect, but we have never spent a Thanksgiving together.

On my side of the family, Thanksgiving really isn't anything.  It's my mom, dad, my grandpa, and I. My mom has such a hate and annoyance for her dad and it's so fake everytime they see each other and it's forced. I don't think he can tell but it's there. This year, we found out my dad had a six month long affair with a male and it has tore our entire family apart. (Not going into detail about this) Even if my parents are still trying to get along. (they still live with each other.)

So, our entire Thanksgiving kinda just seems like forced and I would rather put my boyfriend's family first this year. They all like each other, the family is huge. Parents, cousins, aunts and uncles, siblings, etc. And I'm even cooking a dish for the first time!

My grandpa's the one whose pissed and thinks I'm an asshole for this, but he's not aware of my dad's affair and everything thats been going on. ""She's grown she can do whatever she wants I guess."" In a mean tone.

I think he's angry because we're a little more on the rich side, have better set up, food, but it doesn't matter to me. I'd rather be in a grosser and cramped house, with people who take me in as their own and with the person I love. Even if they're white trash.

So, first off - throw-away cause my BIL might come across this.   
Background -  my husbands family are the ones we spend the Holidays with. Mostly due to logistics/money - my family's several states away. I dont mind that we dont go see my fam for the Holidays - I'm frugal and spent way too much time there, etc. The Holidays are always at the SIL's house - mostly cause it makes it easy on them with them having 2 kids and all their stuff to entertain them is at their house and stuff like that. 

Further back story, I'm a literal person when it comes to stuff, if you make a list saying you want XYZ or need XYZ - well then I'll make XYZ happen. If its not on the list, I aint gonna think about it.  
And I also like to plan ahead on things, like in advance, I'm the kind of person if I'm on time I'm stressed out and want to be there at least 5 mins before time to be there.  


Ok, onto the AITA -   
His family started doing Google Doc sign up sheets for 'Hey heres what we want to have - put your name down next to what you want to bring.' (They also leave room to fill in if you want to bring whatever that isnt on the list) 

Ok no biggy. Mom snatched up most everything to make, there was a few things to make left and we took a few items to make. 

One item we opted to bring is ""Dinner Rolls""  - thats what it said - nothing more nothing less. I put our names down for this last week - on I think Monday. Made note of what we needed to make / bring on our shopping list and had the grocery list submitted for pick up by Thursday night for pick up during the weekend. Didnt bother looking at the list again. Mission accomplished, job well done and all that. 

I dont know what prompted me to look today - I guess just to make sure (even tho I checked it at least 3 times before I made the list of groceries to make sure).   


And today they edited it to say ""Dinner Rolls &amp; Croissants"" ... WTF.  

They edited it on Friday at some point -- and didnt even bother alerting to the change of request. 

No text or phone call of ""Hey I know you signed up for Dinner rolls -- can you also bring Croissants as well?"" 

Now..sure there's time in the day..night before Thanksgiving to go out and go get them -- but I'm of the mindset if they wanted to update the sheet and not let us know about it...whatever, we got what was on the list when we signed up.

My parents noticed something wasn’t right when I was four. At first I was diagnosed with ADD by a psychiatrist who barely spent 20 minutes with me.  My Mom pushed for more testing after realizing I didn’t fit the profile. I was diagnosed with ASD after testing that lasted over 16 hours by a behavioralist, a speech pathologist, and a pediatric neuropsychologist. Needless to say, this was a very rigorous and thorough evaluation. After that I went through the wringer dealing with the public school system and the mental health care industry neither of which knows what to do with people like me.

When I was 14 I met a girl at a summer camp who had ADD. She was very nice. We had a lot in common, we had similar interests and likes, and so we became good friends. We remained good friends until we went to college mainly for the fact that we were now 1000 miles apart.

I kept in touch with her for the next six years.  I’ve only gotten back in contact with her within the in the last two. I don’t know what happened during the time I fell out of touch with her. I think she may have given into some bad influences, but I don’t know for sure what went wrong. I also have a hard time verbalizing what I make of her life now. She’s over 500 pounds, collects social security (I don’t know what for,) no longer speaks to her parents, and doesn’t seem to have a life outside of social media. One thing she does is she blogs endlessly about her life with autism spectrum disorder.

There’s just one problem; she doesn’t have autism spectrum disorder. She’s been subject to the same rigorous testing, and the same periodic reassessments as me. In her case ASD has been ruled out time and again. Bottom line, she DOESN’T HAVE ASD. 

As for her blog, her posts read more like unhinged harangues. She’s clearly not well, but she doesn’t have ASD. After reading one of her blog posts I pointed out she does not have ASD. Her counter argument was that she read and researched ASD and knows for sure she has it.

Since then, a handful of her friends have unloaded on me, saying that I have no right to talk to her like that and who am I to say she doesn’t have ASD? My response is I’m a person who lives with ASD, which is a cradle to the grave thing. One girl argued that her blog is a show of solidarity with people like me. It’s not solidarity, it’s crowding autistics like me out of the conversation about autistics like me, which is a major ongoing problem for the ASD community.

She sometimes offers voluntary trips to the theater, which most of my class doesn't want to go on, but goes anyway to suck up to her.

I'm not one of those people who doesn't want to go and I'm really interested in literature and culture. 
Since our current topic is ""poetry"" and we have only read old poems so far (1850 - 1980), I had the idea that we could go to a poetry slam together to experience today's poetry as well.

Me: Hayley. That lipgloss in your bag is identical to mine, could I look?

However, we’re going to visit my husband’s family for Thanksgiving in Florida today. Initially, I did not want to plan to go due to recent financial loss and the fact that the tickets were too expensive. Still, I did not want my husband to miss this very special holiday that he hasn’t spent with his family in over ten years, so I finally gave in to still go, even though the prices for the tickets where out of budget. 

In the meantime, my MIL heard that we/I wanted to be financially responsible, and immediately sent uns money to cover the flight tickets and now won’t take it back, even if no one has asked her to do so. 
I already feel very uncomfortable with the fact that she did this but he used to be the breadwinner of the family once, so I guess it is okay.

Anyways, she called my husband two days before we’re leaving and told him she already booked a hotel room for the two of us since we can no longer stay in his brother’s house for some reason. Again, no one has asked her to do that and she went ahead and made arrangements without anyone involved. I had to deal with a similar situation a couple of months back with her and back then I did not want to be ungrateful so I went along with her plans as she wanted to this as part of our wedding grift. However, last time she ended up checking in for us and tried to make our room comfortable, put some waters in the fridge, bought flowers, and bought a whole weeks worth of fresh food for us to use in the 5 days we were there. Not only did food go to waste - since we were both not able to choose what to buy for the two of us and not capable of eating for six people - but also did she enter the room before us and made here arrangements at her own terms, which I found very overbearing and disrespectful to our privacy.

Now, AITA for not wanting my MIL or anyone to A) book a hotel room for me and my husband without asking first and B) enter the room first to make it look like what she imagined for us? To me, this is not normal, disrespectful, and overbearing 

My husband, however, is a pretty laid-back character and doesn’t mind that she gets her way one way or another, he has dealt with her his whole life so things like that don’t surprise him anymore. Yet he is aware of this.

I no longer live with that flatmate, and the friendship died because of this incident.

First a summory of everyone involved:

I (24m) tend to be extremely emotional, and sometimes I get so rallied up because of something that I use a lot of swear words and am generally insulting and aggressive. I recently was in therapy for borderline personality disorder (though I don't have BPD but have problems regulating my emotions). That was unknown at the time.

My friend Dan (24d) is a very kind and caring but sometimes stubborn person and can best be described as a sjw. We had lots of arguments and fights about racism, sexism, politics and that the white cis male (which I am) is pure evil. Nevertheless they were a good friend of mine and helped me through a lot of problems, although I since realized that our friendship was very onesided.

My flatmate Fiona (20f) seemed to be very kind, but turned out to be extremely manipulative and toxic. She made my stay at the appartement literal hell, running through the hallway in the middle of the night screaming and giggeling, spreading lies about everyone she didn't like (mostly me it turned out) and gaslit everyone whereever she could. The stories I have about her could probably fill their own subreddit. I was honestly terrified of being alone in the same room with her.

One day we had a flat meeting where we discussed organizational stuff like washer/dryer, garbage disposal, shared bill etc.. Coincidentally, a few days prior one of my cups went missing, so I asked in the meeting if anyone knew anything about it. Fiona then said, in an annoyed tone, that it was me who lost it and brought up something from weeks ago (chocolate went missing) and accused me of that too. There happened a lot of stuff in meetings and in general before this, too, but that was it for me.

After the meeting I went to my room fuming and sent a long voice message to Dan, ranting about Fiona and calling her a c\*nt, among other (admittedly sexist) things. Dan didn't take that well and demanded I  apologize for using such words, but especially for using the word c\*nt. I refused as I was angry af and couldn't think straight. Dan got pissed, accused me of some untrue stuff and ended the friendship then and thereand blocked me.

I talked to a lot of friends (and a therapist) about this and realized since that while my wording was sexist and wrong, it was justified, and everyone said Dan overreacted as well and was childish for blocking me.

Will and I have been seeing each other for around 2 months now, and things have already been iffy with me. He struggles a lot with anxiety, as do I, but he is extremely opinionated and confident in his choices. There’s nothing wrong with that, but he doesn’t handle disagreements well. 

I am an extremely sensitive person who’s almost always been in touch with her emotions. I also am someone who does not judge others based on appearances, and I have a habit of falling in love with someone’s quirks and intelligence. Gender does not matter to me at. I simply look for different traits in people. Will, however, is the complete opposite. 

I was texting Will at the end of my shift about how I wanted to shave my head. This is something that started off as a joke years ago, but this past year or two I have genuinely considered doing it. First, I was gonna see how long I could go growing out my hair. It’s extremely thick, and i’m used to cutting it medium length after it gets so long due to ponytails causing extreme headaches. I started having my hair dresser thin it when i go every few months to touch up my roots.

 Will immediately said please don’t. I asked him why he didn’t want me to, and he told me he is not attracted to bald females at all. I was thinking of, what i thought was, a very cute buzz cut. I can respect having a preference, but he flat out said he just wouldn’t be attracted to my physical appearance at all. He said my personality would still be attractive, but he has a preference of a nice physical appearance over a nice personality. I’ve always wanted to cut my hair super short or buzzed, and my past 2 relationships have never told me not to. I’m used to a response like “I’d prefer your long/shoulder length hair, but…” I’ve never doubted that the guy would still like me. Will’s response is not something i’m used to, however, and i’m debating on jumping ship.

Last year there was a big fight between me, my wife, and my mother about how Christmas would work and who would host. My mom decided she didn't want to see me anymore. 

It sucks, but I'm not going to beg her. My wife and I have a disagreement regarding our one and a half year old son. She thinks my mom is a horrid person for not sending him gifts, cards, asking for pictures. I think if my mom actually wants no contact she is doing the respectful thing. Also we both agree she wouldn't be allowed to see him, so I don't really get what my wife wants.

I have asked her to not badmouth my mom to any of my family. I want to preserve the few relationships I have left, and it is honestly embarrassing. My grandparents gave my mom zero help with me because not their kid, not their problem, and that was with them being fairly close to my mom, so I can't imagine how they would react to hearing my wife's views on this.

Recently we ran into my uncle at my grandparents house. It was awkward as I know that dude hates me and is 100% on my mom's team, but we were all guilted into staying for lunch. My grandmother was trying to get my uncle to come for Thanksgiving and he got pissy and said no she knows he spends all holidays with my mom. My wife then asked how my mom was and I felt myself cringe. My uncle said she is great. My wife said we wouldn't know as she never sends any gifts for our son, so maybe she is dead.

I gave her a look begging her to stop. My uncle's wife burst out laughing. My uncle asked if she was kidding or if she really thought my mom was going to buy gifts for a child she did not know. My wife went on a rant about how she would do anything to have any amount of contact with our future grandchildren. My uncle laughed and said wow such a gold digger you put \*his ex who he hate's name\* to shame.

My wife immidiatley looked like she was going to cry but I just couldn't bring myself to say anything. I was mortified and I'd begged her not to bring up the gift thing. She asked if I was going to defend her. I said no an she ran out of the room. We left and she is furious with me. She says I betrayed her and my mom is going to laugh when she heard.

We've already decided that we'll make everything official once we meet each other's families. However, I have a few worries about him meeting my family because they tend to go to the extreme to see if a person is suitable to join our family or be around the family during events. So I'm worried because I rather not stay a ""dateless loser"" because my family scares anyone I date away with how they are.

So I decided to sit my family down and ask them to avoid discussing politics, hot-button issues in the world, and religion when they meet my guy. I have lost so many people due to my family using these topics to gauge someone's personality and use that as a way to say they're no good. We're a black family, and thus these things are apparently ""part of our cultural identity.""

This is based on the last dinner we had with the guy I was dating getting grilled by my mother the whole time we ate dinner because the guy disagreed with my mom about Bill Cosby being framed. Mind you, the guy had tried to drop it, but my mom kept pushing and pushing the subject until she finally decided to change it to race relations, which dissolved into a debate about racism in the country. The guy got up from the table, helped clean up, and left after he was done due to my mom doing this. Mind you, when he did go, my mom said, ""Oh, he's racist, and if your grandfather were still alive, he would've been told off.""

My brothers agreed with my mom and said I needed someone to understand how we conducted our dinner discussions. Mind you; our regular dinner discussions are about family trips we plan or what we did for the week. So they usually use politics, region, and race relations only whenever I bring someone to meet them.

So I want to tell them that I DO NOT want any of this to happen with the new guy I'm with. I don't wish to race relations, politics, and religion to be the so-called ""highlight"" of the dinner suddenly and weaponized to ""test"" the person to see if they're ""worthy."" I will also let my mom know that it's hypocritical that she did this when my brothers' wives didn't get the same treatment (my older brother's wife is white, and my younger brother's wife is black) when they met everyone.

And I'm going to ask my aunt and uncle not to get blitzed off their butts before they come over. Because my uncle has a strong history of saying horrible stuff to a person, getting angry when they don't want to argue, and it turns into a physical altercation. And my aunt will say things that embarrass me or ask them when they'll marry me and when we'll have kids. But she's the lesser of two evils because she will tear into my mom afterward if my mom pulls what she usually does. But it's rare. Mind you, and I'm going to pour all the alcohol in the house down the sink just in case.

OP ""Mary"" (29F) is a pharmacist who is about 8 weeks pregnant. She didn't announced her pregnancy to her coworkers yet as she would like to wait until 12 weeks to be safe. Her other coworkers are 3 females and 1 male manager (important later). 

Patient ""Kevin"" (mid 30sM) comes in during the evening this past Saturday to pick up his medication called finasteride. (Generally used for enlarged prostate, smaller doses for hair loss). He notices it's not cut into quarters and it's the full tablet in the vial and requests that Mary cuts them into quarters for him on the spot. Mary says she can't do that, as it's unsafe for women to handle that medication, especially broken tablets. He thinks Mary is just BSing him and is just trying to slack off and not do it, says he has a date waiting in the car, wear some gloves like the others do and just do it. Mary tries to explain that she isn't comfortable doing that either, and she was also quite busy, but she could get the male coworker to cut them for him if he wanted to come back Monday when he would be in, or Kevin could buy a pill splitter for under $10 dollars and cut the tablets himself. He said ""he doesn't have time to split tablets"". He eventually left the tablets with Mary to have them cut by the male manager, while also threatening to file a complaint against Mary etc.

Mary messaged the male manager about the situation and to kindly split the tablets on Monday for Kevin, and the manager also questioned why Mary didn't just do it then and there. She explained how she didn't feel comfortable handling medication that isn't recommended for females, even with gloves. The manager didn't reply. 

On Monday, Mary's shift is after the manager's. She notices her note and tablets about Kevin still on the table. Manager says he was too busy and didn't have time to get to it. Mary gets frustrated and then one of the female techs (early 20s) just gets up, puts gloves on, and cuts them, and loudly puts the basket on the table after without saying anything. 

Mary feels like she might be the AH for causing delays and friction at work now for something minor like cutting tablets.

Otherwise, no hard feelings, no issues, no hostility.

Fast forward to today - he messaged me several weeks after ending a relationship he'd gotten into over the past year and asked if I wanted to grab a beer. I said sure, and we've been reconnecting over the past few weeks. He's a decent guy, has a stable job, isn't aggressive or argumentative, very easy t be around and open up to, and is pretty genuine. 

My issue isn't these things, it's that he's actually lazy and very, very passive. 

He explained that things didn't work out with his ex because she had three daughters that were very messy, as was she, and he was tired of cleaning up after them. That he's meticulous and clean and doesn't like messes. I know - as I'm sure we all do - there's probably more to the story, but I wasn't trying to dive into all that. 

He invited me over for dinner and said I could bring my dogs to run around in his backyard with his lab. Sounded pretty perfect to me, so I agreed (I'll do just about anything to let my dogs have some fun). I got there and realized that while he's neat in the sense that he picks things up and doesn't have clutter, he is \*not\* clean. He picks things up and puts them away, but he does not actually clean. 

The carpets were in beyond obvious need of vacuuming, the tables and counters had way too much dried, caked-on food for a single man with no kids in the house anymore. I didn't sleep there, but was in his bedroom (he was showing off some artwork) and noticed all of the dirt and small debris in his bed (he had all white bedding) indicating it'd been ages since he'd washed/changed his sheets. 

And it all just gave me so much ick. 

I realize I could tell him all of these things, but I also realize he likely isn't going to change these things. He's made several comments about how people aren't going to change at this age and need to be accepted as they are, so I'm pretty sure he has no intention to do so.

I also realize that continuing to see him will mean I'd have to clean his home for him - or nag him to do it - to make it somewhere I'd want to spend time. And! Should we end up moving in together, I'd wind up being his maid, which just isn't for me.

I am doing Animal Care for my college course, and I love it. In the course we are assigned different groups, i am in group Echo. The other day, someone made a group on SnapChat and invited everyone to the group, except for one person. At first I didn’t think anything of it, I just that this one person, let’s call her Lucy, didn’t have SnapChat and didn’t want it.
Anyway, I went to a Gig in my town last night, and it was about 3 hours long. I had a great time, but the mood was ruined when I got home and checked my phone. My phone was full on SnapChat messages, I just thought it was the group being goofy like usual. When I looked at the messages, I realised that the entire group was saying awful things about Amy and our teacher, let’s call her Jackie. They were saying awful things, calling Lucy a retarded potato, a walking penguin, she’s a freak, a p*****ile and said that they hope Jackie falls off her bike (she biked to college) that she’s a horrible teacher. I don’t even want to retype everything else.
The fact is, I have been bullied my whole life, and if I had just ignored and let it continue, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. So this morning, as soon as I got off the bus, I went to the head of the department, we’ll call her Sarah. I showed her the messages, the voice messages, the horrible things they were saying, and Sarah soon reported it to her safeguarding officer, and told me to go to my next lesson.
During that lesson, 8 people were pulled out of the class, though not all at once. They have all been suspended for the things they said about Lucy and Jackie. My mum and the teachers have all been praising me, saying how brave I am and how proud they are of me for coming forward and not keeping it a secret. You’d think I’d be happy, right? Well, no.
I can’t help but feel a sense of guilt, that it’s my fault that those 8 kids got suspended. I know that what they did was wrong, and they shouldn’t have done it at all, but i still feel like it’s my fault for not stopping them when I first saw the messages, like it’s my fault for getting them kicked out.
Am I The Arsehole?

 She doesn't make much money being on disability so I told her ""its not expensive.you could use it more than me and itll help you with your physio.""I wanted to help as I was in a position to do so at the time. She has several physical/medical issues she has from past trauma and abuse.I helped her as much as I can while dealing with my own health often putting hers before mine. I was even able to buy her a wheelchair to help for her really bad EDS days. 

Both of us have been working on ourselves and setting boundaries when needed.(this included both of us cutting contact with our mom) and stop people take advantage of us.  So we've been each other's support. I know I haven't been as close lately so I haven't called/visited much. Sometimes forgetting anyone exists outside my wife and our cats.I've just been in my own world trying to bring myself back to a healthy mental status. My wife has been an amazing help!

A few days ago, my sister had called me, I missed the call by seconds.Called back.had an okay chat. About 15mins in; I said I'm starting to feel a little better.Got on my wife's health insurance so I can get a therapist, dived back into my hobbies, watching anime and cooking with my wife again.I was excited to feel like I was making progress. Thenbi had said; ""i'm just happy life seems to be getting better. I've had a rough couple of months""

She instantly exploded at me, ""Shut the F up! My life's f-jng worse!"" 

I just sat in shock for a moment processing. Idk if I blanked out or not but when I snapped back from the shock all I could say was ""what? This isn't a trauma competition... what's happening to you doesn't make my shit any less valid.""

She yelled again saying that we never listen to her that she apologized already for it. I was honest and said ""i admit idk if i heard an apology or not in the moment of shock.But I'm allowed to still be upset about what was said and being yelled at. Then she started yelling more. I yelled back at her that she was doing the exact same thing that she screams at dad for doing.More yelling so i started just pulling back from the convo by just agreeing with what ever she said to just get her to calm down and stop trying to yell at me for being upset. So AITA for basicly going no contact with her now for my own mental health atm? We haven't  called, text, or even sent a tiktok video to her in days which is definitely not like us. I am just done being yelled at and just wanted to vent about shit going

I've been called an asshole by my (F, 50) friends because I've not made any effort to find my family (parents and siblings, including my twin) for two decades. They think I'm being unreasonable.

Backstory is that throughout my childhood my parents and siblings never treated me like I was a daughter/sibling. Parents would constantly put me down, call me names, humiliate me in front of their friends and my dad would beat me. My siblings never endured this. I started working at 14 and immediately they took half my wages for rent (my 19- and 18-year-old sisters never had to pay rent). 

My mum would lunge at me and then laugh when I flinched or cowed. I was bullied at school for four years, they did absolutely nothing and neither did the school. I heard her tell her friend I was bullied for four years but never told her. I told her every day when I came home from school in tears. It was always my fault. Anything go missing? Yep that was my fault too. My twin got bullied and my dad sorted it the same day. I resented every single day I had to live there. 

Eventually, I moved out at 16 because I had enough of being beaten. My mum and dad decided to up and leave to another city three hours away. They always moved around so eventually I wasn't able to find them anymore. But they know I stayed in the same city, I'm on public record so they could easily find me. I have no idea where they are and twenty years have suddenly past me by, without a word from them. I don't have huge amounts of money to spend trying to find them. Apparently, this makes me the AH even though I'm on disability because they left me mentally fucked up and my mobility is shot. 

Now I don't know if I really should have tried harder to reach out and ""be the better person"" (their words, not mine) because my dad in particular is in his 80s now and mum is in her early 70s.

So my(26)  bf(27)  is always late. I only said bf  ..but we're just dating but almost a good few months.
So we've been talking for a while, and went out on our first date recently. Due to work schedules, we finally had time.
We made arrangements with specific meeting times. He insisted on meeting me at a specific location for 10:30am,even though I offered to pick him up at home.
We talk the morning and then I work till 10.
At 9:59am, he calls and tells me it was raining and asked to pick him up at his house which I did.
We had a  great time and he later confesses that he was playing games and didn't want to leave the game halfway. I'm annoyed but don't say anything.
So here's my predicament: Last night, I called him and he declined the call, and replied half 8, he'll call me...usually we game together for a bit. 

I wait until 8:45 and realise he is gonna be late again, he always does this. Usually when he says a time, i do everything I need to do and be waiting on him for that time. I'm super annoyed so I switch off my phone.

Not tryna shock nobody so I'll say it plainly: I am a mom of sixteen, but only 2 lived passed infancy. I and my husband chose ""Tameka"" and ""Jeorge"" as baby names since before we married.

Soon ""after"" marriage we became pregnant (really it was why we married so quick). I assumed it to be a boy, but we lost the baby so we'll never know.

My first Tameka was born in 2008, followed by my first Jeorge in January of 2011. Tameka died shortly after Jeorge's birth. Two miscarriages later, an infection took Jeorge away, right before his second birthday.

My preemie Tameka was born in 2013, and she unfortunately passed away in the NICU within two weeks. My next four pregnancies were miscarriages except the last (twins). One twin absorbed the other early in the pregnancy, and though we thought our second Jeorge would make it, he was born dead/stillborn.

In 2015 I got clean because I knew I couldn't keep living how I was. My husband and I agreed to try IVF. Our first pregnancy with IVF lasted only a few weeks, but my second gave me Jeorge in 2017 (the subject of this post). His sister, my next pregnancy, my third Tameka is now 2-years-old. She is having it harder than Jeorge after breaking her hand but she is adapting to using her left. Our final pregnancy (last year), which was not intentional, ended in another miscarriage.

So here's the actual issue: First off, I must say that no one knows about our taboo naming habits except immediate family. My husb &amp; I don't think it's a problem because our first children didn't survive infancy. We felt robbed of our dream family, as none got to the age of three except our Jeorge and soon Tameka. With a little faith, trust, pixie dust, and IVF, we have our dream family now.

Jeorge has ""gained consciousness"" lately, so to speak, and knows death exists. After he questioned me about miscarriage, I decided I'd tell him about his siblings. Using the stork analogy (I only found out today that storks are real LOL), to not make it too sad, I said the storks fly babies in from the Orient and sometimes have to fly them back. As soon as I mentioned that Jeorge had two siblings of the same name, he told me he didn't want to be named after his brothers and that ""even wolves"" aren't (?).

It had been such a long road to have a Jeorge, and yet my Jeorge isn't proud of his name. But it's totally normal to be named after a dead relative, even I was, yet he is taking it really bad. AITA or my son?

TL;DR, my son is mad because I told him I had sons with the same name before they died in infancy/stillbirth.

I don’t get sick very often, but when I get sick, I get SICK. 

I’ve got body aches, chills, and a whole arrangement of other symptoms. I’m very visibly unwell. 

for 1, I’ve been at my partner’s studio. I fell Ill at his place, but was willing to go home because I didn’t want him to get sick and in the past he hasn’t been that great at catering to me when I’m unwell. 

I’ve been sleeping on the couch while at his place, SICK. he didn’t object to me sleeping on the couch while he’s on his bed. He said I could join him on the bed, but kept making comments about not wanting to be in my face because I was coughing pretty bad. I left it. I usually enjoy sleeping on the couch, so I thought maybe that was his logic when taking the bed. In addition too, I was sweating so bad from my fever that I had to change my clothes every few hours. I can understand not wanting to share the bed. 

This morning, I woke up with a splitting headache and body aches so bad I couldn’t coax myself back to sleep. I truly felt like something was wrong, like my body was about to go into shock mode and just shut down. I woke my partner up at about 6:45 am, crying because I was in that much discomfort, and asked if we could go to the clinic or ER. he told me to take myself in his car because he was tired from gaming. gave me his keys and everything and let me go on my way to the parking garage, even though I was on bed rest for the past two days. I was in so much pain at this point I didn’t even think too much of it until I got in the car and saw the clinic/ER was closed (small town). so I went back in, and told him to take me home when he got up. 

I originally did not tell him why I wanted to go home, but he pestered me, and I kind of blew up, saying that it was very selfish to let me go to the clinic in the car by myself when I explicitly said I do not feel well. He thinks that this is not fair because he says he checked the time and saw that it was too early for me to go to the clinic and I technically never drove, so I shouldn’t be upset. I think that’s BS. He proceeded to get up an hour later, take me home, and commented in the car that I pissed him off and that the doctor wasn’t gonna do anything but tell me I had a fever.  I just don’t know what to do. Am I being too harsh? He proves me right every time I say he is selfish.

My brother is physically disabled, has low vision and high mobility difficulties. He is currently attending college and his tests are done in the afternoon. 

I got a medical appointment through my country's public health system and it took 3 months to schedule it for yesterday. 

This week my brother is taking the tests. 

I went with my mother's car, I told her I would be picking up the car (I filled it up). Nobody told me absolutely nothing about who would take my brother to the test, because I'm not the one who takes it (my other brother does). I passed by his side and said that I was leaving with the car for a appointment, he replied ok and I went to. 

My appointment was at 1 pm and I still hadn't come in until 1:40 pm (this is normal waiting time).

 Out of nowhere, at 1:45 pm, several messages from my brother and mother saying where I was, that I had to take my brother, the car was at home for that and that I should urgently come home.

 I was just like ""?????"" and I said that I'm waiting to be called and I wouldn't leave in the middle of it with the chance of waiting another 3 months, because of their lack of communication. 

Btw, where I was was 15 minutes away from home, my house is 10 minutes away from college, so he would be late ANYWAY. Uber is more difficult because it has a lot of difficulty in getting in the car and not everyone has the patience for that. 

My mother started to say that it was her car and that she was demanding that I go back to the house, because my brother would miss his test. In the meantime, I was called, so I just said that I was going into the appointment right now.

 The appointment lasted 40 minutes. When I looked at my cell phone, there were 40 messages from my mother, saying that I was a entitled brat for thinking that I could use it as I wanted and that my brother couldn't find an uber, when he could, harrived late, but  was so nervous for fear of missing the test that he couldn't do it right the test. She started blaming me for that, taking the car away from me and even though I said it was their lack of communication, she said that I should have confirmed who would take my brother (I never do) with one of us.

 I don't see myself as guilty, I told EVERYONE involved that I would take the car and be at the appointment for 2 hours (waiting time + appointment), so they simply didn't tell me, because if they had, I would have taken an UBER.

 There are two cars at my mother's house. One she went to work, but that day she couldn't take my brother. 

Yes, it was an important appointment.

My MIL is religious, and used to work for a church, though she doesn't go regularly anymore. She's still very spiritual, and though she doesn't push her views, she often will mention Jesus. I don't mind too much because that's just how she is, and she's never tried to force her opinions on me or husband. I have been very clear with MIL that I don't want her talking about Jesus to my kid, and she didn't love that, because she often just mentions him casually, and it was difficult for her to adjust how she talks, but she has respected my wishes with a few occasional slip-ups, which I appreciate. 

My husband and I are not religious, and we AGREED to raise our kids to be open-minded, and make their own decisions. We don't want them to be influenced by religion before they are old enough to understand it, and want them to form their own opinions when they are old enough to. 

This year, we are planning to spend Christmas with my husband's family. My MIL has a tradition of always reading a bible story on Christmas Eve. This wasn't an issue for the last few years, as last year, we spent Christmas with my family, who are also not religious, and the year before, we spent it alone because of COVID, and prior to that, our kid was still a baby so not old enough to understand anything. 

 I am adamant that MIL not read a bible story this year, because I don't want my kid exposed to religion this young, unless it's from an intellectual perspective, NOT from someone presenting it as fact.

 The only way I would be okay with someone reading her a bible story would be if they presented it as just a story, and perhaps accompanied it with some stories from other religions/cultures as well, so she's getting more than just one perspective, and with none of them presented as fact, but simply as stories from different cultures. 

I told MIL that I wasn't comfortable with it, and said she could read it if she wants, but I'll be taking my kid out for a walk, or to another room while she does it. My husband got annoyed with me, and said it's ""just one"" and the it's ""not all the time"", and that I should just let MIL have her tradition. I'm just really not comfortable with that, as MIL always reads the story as though it's fact, and takes it very seriously, and my kid is still at a very impressionable age, and tends to believe what they're told, especially if it's coming from an adult they trust.

Since I work remotely, I am splitting my time down here between taking days off and working. I thought I would be staying with my dad, but he is full up at his house, so instead I am staying with my grandparents, who live in the same town.

When I arrived, it quickly became apparent that my dad had undersold my grandparents' condition. While neither need a full time nurse or anything, they clearly need a lot of extra help around the house. Which, to be clear, I am perfectly fine doing. I just wish I had been informed of this beforehand.

On my first day back working, my grandma fell and sustained a minor injury. She was taken to the hospital and has recovered, but I've basically been attending to my grandpa's every need since then while also working a full time job from home.

Well it was determined that my grandparents need something closer to full time help around the house and they've settled on... me. They told my dad this, and he immediately started setting things up for me to more or less move down to Florida full time until my grandparents can be moved into an assisted living facility (which would take months, at least). This includes him paying half my rent and bills for Chicago because I'm still on a lease for another year. As usual with my dad, this was not an ask, he was ""telling me what was going to happen.""

I've never been good at sticking up for myself, but I immediately put my foot down. I told him in no uncertain terms that when my scheduled return flight was coming, I would be on it to go back to my life in Chicago. My apartment and friends were there, not to mention that as a gay man, I will always be more comfortable living in Chicago than rural Florida. My dad told me he was disgusted with me for not helping family, and seemed to hint he wasn't going to take me to the airport regardless. I have no access to my own transportation down here.

AITA for not being willing to take this on? I love my grandparents and they do need more help, I just can't be the one to do it, especially since it was not my choice.

The bucket and fluids are forever engrained in my brain and then someone saying come hold your brother but I honestly just wanted to barf. 

My parents have the other version of the memory where I was super happy to see my brother and be the first one to hold him, so they always mention it whenever they have the chance. All my family of doctors support this and are always talking about how much of a beautiful moment and I know they encourage it to other patients saying how much I loved that moment. 

I only realized they were doing this recently when another friend of the family is about to gave birth and they mentioned the story once again telling the family it would be a wonderful bonding moment for siblings. I just saw another small kid about to witness a horrible moment so I interjected and told them I don't know what version they are talking about, but it was a horrible moment and I don't even remember my brother, I just remember the gross stuff and told the kid to yeet out of there if they had the chance. 

My family got upset at me for ""lying"" and making the other family to get their energy down. I told my family and my mom I wasn't lying and I hate talking about the birth of my brother and asked them to stop mentioning it to other people to avoid kids being left with this image without their consent. Now they are calling me an AH for ruining a core sibling bonding moment and making my parents feel guilt for giving me a ""trauma"". AITA?

Well after that party she became a completely different person. she was rude and she cut me out of conversations, she suddenly told me that we would never be a thing, I took the hint and slowly distanced myself from her, the funny thing is from that point on she started hanging out with MY FRIENDS who I introduced her to and who didn’t like her beforehand and cutting me out of the group and went on to be with one of them.
Some time I talked to her friend (also F17) and asked if it’s my fault and her friend said it’s not my fault and that Amy (the girl I kissed) is just paranoid and struggles to trust people.

Her mother messages me saying  that it was sad we couldn't make it to the wedding....Wait what?! 
I tell her that K hadn't told me she had picked a date and I didn't even know that she had gotten married.
K's mom thinks it must have been her now husband who pulled the stunt where he dosent like me due to me being openly Pagen and not to worry about it, and send me photos of K's wedding.... my jaw drops and my heart breaks...
She had copied everything from my wedding plain book.
She copied the fowers in the bouquet that were a combination of the flowers from both my grandparents bouquets, Decorations, photo spots and poses, hair, makeup.... and THE DRESS..... 
I could have delt with everything else being copied BUT the dress, I don't know what to do I'm in Shock! I asked K's mother not to tell her that she had told me about the wedding and told her why.
K's mother is LIVID and so are her bothers as they see me as there little sister also and have all agreed to not tell K that I know what she did, but don't think I should drop her from being my MOH.
K has been trying to pressure me to ""hurry up and pick a date."" and I think she is just trying to embarrass me on my wedding day.

It's a spot mostly aimed at students and people who are self employed. They have a small place for kids in the back with some toys where usually little toddlers waddle around while their parents chat. 

Today there was an extremely loud child. This kid was 4 or 5 which is a lot older than the kids who are generally there, but that's fine. Thing is that he screamed constantly. Like this is not a quiet place at all, people are talking constantly but his screams went through everything. He wasn't crying or upset, he just seemed to scream because it was fun to him, mom did nothing about it. 

My friend and i moved places at first thinking we wouldn't be able to hear it in the front end of the sitting area, but nope still piercing screams every 10 seconds. After 30 or so minutes of having to listen to it we discretely asked one of the staff if something could be done because we couldn't work like this or even understand each other. The staff member (who was very nice) told us that the kid was the owners nephew and there was nothing she could do but that this wasn't a one off (i guess we just got lucky this was the first time we encountered them) and we weren't the first today to complain. We asked if it was okay if we went to the mom to ask and she told us to go for it, but to please keep them out of it (in case it wasn't clear, their boss sucks). 

My friend and i went to the mom and asked if she could maybe ask her son to stop screaming because it was not suitable for this space. Right of the bat the mom started yelling at us saying that it was none of our business and we had no idea how hard being a mom was. My friend and i don't have kids so yes it's true that we don't know how hard it is to be a parent but since when does being a parent give you the right to dominate spaces by having your child scream? 

She called over a staff member demanding we be thrown out using her brother (the owner) as a threat. It was the same woman we talked to earlier and we told her immediately when she came over that we would leave on our own. She escorted us out apologizing, we told her it wasn't her fault and left a tip to make sure she knew we weren't angry at her or the other staff.

I told another friend about this and they told me that i was an asshole because the kid could have had autism. I will admit that this didn't cross my mind in the moment and could be the case but at the same time, how does that change the situation? Would it be okay for a child with Autism to disrupt a public space like that? I'm fine with kids making noise, the babies and toddlers that are in the same kid's area also cry at times or yell, but it's normal kid noises. This kid was screaming nonstop and i don't think that's something everything else should be expected to deal with.

For context: We've been engaged ~9 months, but dating for &gt;7 years, so I'm quite familiar with his family. But because I grew up in a somewhat dysfunctional (ie. emotionaly abusive, always walking on egg-shells etc.) 'family', I'm not yet properly comfortable with them. My 'family' situation also means fiance and one of my brothers are the only people I truly view as real family.
Additionally, fiance has been at university the last few years, and covid meant he couldn't come home during breaks, so he's not had Christmas here in a few years.
We are also getting a new puppy right before Christmas (not a major factor, but still an added complication)

MIL's reasoning:
- To her, christmas is about spending time with [extended] family, which she can't do easily, so she wants as much of her family as possible present
- everyone she's asked has said it's (quote) unacceptable to not visit either my parents or MIL and FIL
- she wasn't expecting us to move out so soon after fiance got back, so was expecting to have him around this Christmas
- we could spend part of the day alone, and part of it at MIL's

My reasoning:
- We will only get one first Christmas together and I want to use it to build our own traditions.
- To me, Christmas is about spending time with [immediate] family, as my 'family' has never lived close to extended family, and when they did visit it mainly caused tension and stress.
- I've spent the last few years really looking forward to being able to spend Christmas with my real family instead of being stuck with my 'family'
- I work in retail so am likely to have alot of shifts around Christmas, so we may not get much time together outside Christmas day
- puppy can't be left alone, but I'm not sure I'll be comfortable having her (a 10/11 week old miniature breed) around MIL and FIL's dog (a very energetic 1.5yo large breed)
- we can spend next year Christmas with them when it's not our first one together


Fiance is not particularly bothered if we go to MIL's or celebrate just the two of us, so I feel as if pushing the matter will make me the bad guy, especially because MIL really stressed that she would feel (quote) gutted if we choose not to visit them. But I'm also struggling to find a compromise that doesn't feel like it impacts our ability to figure out what Christmas looks like/means to us.
I'm worried no matter what we choose I'm going to feel horrible and not end up enjoying the day (+potentially bringing the mood down unless I mask that I'm not enjoying things).... But the only diplomatic solution to *that* that I can think of would be for fiance to visit his family and me to visit my 'family', which is a concept I dread because it feels like it would be deliberatly returning to the place I've been trapped the last few years while fiance was at uni.

I (F) was in my room rubbing one out. Usually, before I do this, I triple-check to see if my door is locked since I have family members that could potentially walk in. I lock it for the safety of everyone in my house and for privacy. I don't listen to music either when I do this, but that day I did, since my family members were being abnormally loud in the hallways and we have fairly thin walls.

While I was flicking it, I was on my phone (not calling anyone or taking pictures) and listening to music. All of the sudden, my door swings open. Turns out, my mom had been knocking on the door and I hadn't heard her, so she picked my lock. It's safe to say she was pretty pissed. I was extremely embarrassed, since she could clearly see what I was up to.

I wasn't trying to ignore her, I genuinely couldn't hear her AT ALL. I tried to explain the circumstances as to why I didn't hear her and open my door, but I was still punished even though she understood that I wasn't on the phone or taking pictures of myself.

To be fair, it wasn't a HARSH punishment, and she knows I'm *active* so I don't think she was shocked, but recently it's been awkward between us. I'm still pretty ashamed of the whole thing myself, too.

I messaged my ex husband (26m) as soon as she was admitted telling him I was at the hospital with our daughter. 

He did not respond the entire day and messaged me the next day talking about how he was going to be still taking our other children for his scheduled parenting time but wants to have his parenting time with our daughter made up at another time.
We have 3 other children and he did not ask where they were or how our daughter was while I was admitted into the hospital for an entire day.

I was a bit upset with him because I don’t understand what took so long for a response and I said to him..
I messaged you about it at noon yesterday and you didn’t check in with her. What a shitty parent that showed no concern for their daughter they didn’t even bother to call or check on while they knew she was at the hospital.

Now I thought it was shitty but I probably shouldn’t have let my anger get the best of me and called him “shitty” even though I still believe it was a shitty move for a parent.

His gf messaged me and told me I had no place in telling him he is a shitty parent and she doesn’t appreciate me talking down to her partner.
That if I don’t like his decisions that a personal problem and I can’t control him anymore because we aren’t married. 

Im not trying to control him. Just think he should have contacted me about our daughter after I made him aware of her being admitted due to low oxygen.

We recently had a chance to get back on our feet and put some money in savings with my new OTR trucking job. We are trying to save enough to straight up purchase a house or a large down payment. We discussed and agreed that all monies earned will go into the savings to achieve this goal. My wife is a homemaker but 1-2x a week will help an elderly couple with chores around the house and brings in $100 a week. My income is higher and accounts for about 97% of our income. Absolutely not saying homemaker job is easy, it is quite difficult and harder than other jobs I had. You should see some of the task and school schedule she can pull off, it's quite an amazing thing.

My wife has a sister that lives in Hawaii and all the family will be meeting up at grandmas for Christmas this year. My wife and I discussed and we decided to get a hotel room nearby as grandma house is small. We discussed and also decided to rent the room next to us for my sister-in-law and also the banquet room for Christmas dinner (again grandma house is small and hosting 30+ people). Total came out to $3500 (our room, SIL room and hall). 

My wife has been talking with her Mother and Aunt back in Sept and they decided to fly to Hawaii in March/April 2023 to see the sister and tickets were $500. Just recently she confessed to me that she went into the safe and took $500 in cash from the house saving fund, got a money order and mailed it to the Aunt for the cost of the ticket without any discussion. She said she felt guilty and previously discussed with our 4 son's (13-18yo) and asked not to tell me cause she was afraid I would say no to using our house money for HER personal vacation fund. Yes I was pissed and left the house. I felt let down and disappointed my wife would do this. When I got back we had a lengthy argument to find out tickets were transferable but non refundable. My wife said she will change flight location to area back east when we will go house hunting.

We dropped the subject and my SIL called my wife last night and started to yell at her over  the speaker phone and said she was pissed she was not going to Hawaii to see her and proceed to tell me that I'm controlling her sister and I'm the asshole. The sister told me that my wife said she was sorry and she should still get to go to Hawaii with the Mother and Aunt. Needless to say my wife hung up the phone because she saw I was getting mad at her sister.

My stepdad also had work so he couldn't watch the kids. My little cousin who we'll call K for personal reasons, is 7 years old and came to visit for thanksgiving. My little sister who we'll call A just turned 5. Yesterday while babysitting, I had a whole schedule planned out. We had lunch already and was told to have snack time at 2 and then again at 4:30 when my stepdad came out of work. Everything was going fine until I went to use the restroom. I was feeling sick so I was in there trying to throw up and K was telling A to bang on the door while I was in there when I had repeatedly told them to stop. After that, we went outside to play games which was fine until towards the end. We have a rocking chair outside and once I got tired of playing, I went to sit down and just rest while they played with our dogs. Thats when K decided to tell A to rock me back and forth. I kept telling them to stop but they wouldnt and i couldnt even get up because i started to feel dizzy. I had talk in a very serious tone to get them to stop then they did. We went back inside and K just started giving me demands which I didn't go by which cause her to be more mad and extra rude. I don't like the fact she's telling my sister to do things that went against our rules. Fast forward to when my stepdad gets out of work. He's very tired and goes to take a nap. I have to do some cleaning work outside which isn't much its basically just picking up trash outside and cleaning the dog poop. When I come back inside I see that the girls are jumping over him while hes napping which seems extremely rude to me. When they see me again, K says that he's the better babysitter for not doing anything. I don't like the way she treats me, my mom, or my stepdad because i feel like she takes advantage of our hospitality. Along with the fact she tells my sister to do things she shouldn't or go against me or the house rules. This is my first post so I'm not sure if I said anything wrong or incorrectly.
