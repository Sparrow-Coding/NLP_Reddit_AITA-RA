Her school always does both May and December graduations depending on when the students in question finish their required credits, and my daughter had spent an extra semester abroad interning at an international nonprofit. 

We threw a party for her this Saturday to celebrate her upcoming graduation and she invited a lot of extended family and friends. When we sat down to eat my husband made a speech about how proud he was of my daughter and our son (23M) for both getting the job of their dreams after college. He also said he was proud of our younger daughter (18F) who, after this gap year, will be starting at the University of Pennsylvania in the fall. 

Before the family and guests could toast, I decided to add in how proud I was of all of our kids, and to wish good luck to my youngest daughter (16F) who is busting her behind in various ACT and SAT programs because she is applying to a bunch of colleges next year. Somebody commented that is a lot of college bills so I added to my speech "" So a toast also to all the delinquent tenants in the state who allow us to hand $250,000 a kid to these institutions.""

Apparently that didn't go over well with some of the guests, especially my daughter and her guests. My daughter said "" Really? That wasn't necessary mom. Making light of throwing people out."" My husband told her to stop being dramatic as it was just a joke and we should just eat now.

After the party, my daughter still laid into me about my joke. She got in a fight with her two younger sisters who argued that it isn't "" dad's"" fault that tenants don't pay rent and landlords want them ejected. For background, my husband is a real estate attorney for whom 50 percent of his practice is like a churning mill of never ending eviction cases where he only represents the landlord. It is the butt of the joke for family gatherings because he equates it to being like Dr. Phil in the middle of a bunch of squabbling adults. Also because even I, who only has a GED, can basically referee each case and know the outcomes.

AITA for making a joke about essentially what my husband does for a living? He definitely does more glamorous and complex acquisition stuff but the other end other practice does pay a lot of bills, and I think my daughter should be more grateful for what paid her private college tuition and subsidized her unpaid European internship.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4854644,public,top,self,AITA for the toast I made at my daughter's party?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcp7re/aita_for_the_toast_i_made_at_my_daughters_party/,all_ads,6,,,

We have been together for almost a year(dec 23rd is our 1 year) and the only dates we have been on are a few ‘going out to eat’ type dates. We haven’t gone out to drink together since he’s turned 21 and he’s never spent the night with me (he’s a university student who lives with his parents still so staying with him is out of the question). He’s already made a big deal about spending the night with me using the excuses “I choose where I sleep” and “I don’t want to spend the night with you because you’ll want me to start moving in that same night” which isn’t true at all (moving in together is not something we have ever talked about anyways). But recently he’s talked abo it how he wants to hang out with his friends and how they are going to go to a party and go out to bars. But he doesn’t want me to go. I started to get uncomfy with this and said that it was weird he’d want to not take me like that considering not to long ago he wanted me to hang out with him and his friends and vice versa. I already don’t see him often because our work and school schedules don’t colloid and he doesn’t stay the night with me even though it would be convenient some days for him (especially with finals coming up) but he said he didn’t want me to be down his back and that he would have to have conversations with me if I went and he just wants to hang out with his friends without me being with him. I told him that we have never hung out together in that way and he can’t just make assumptions. I could always bring my friends too and it could be a group thing (his two friends and my two - three friends) but then he goes on about how I just need to trust him and we have an argument about how he’s the one that had a streak with a girl from high school who he never really knew, had only one class with and she only sent him selfies they never talked and I thought that was weird. And now him saying he doesn’t want to go to bars or parties with me I feel like that’s very weird and now something I’m not comfortable with. What should I do? How should I approach this?

I want to clarify I understand spending time apart and him wanting to spend time with his friends alone but I really don’t see a party or bar being the best place to do that. Not at least without your significant other with you. He has plenty of opportunities to hang out with his friends he just chooses not to because “I need to study”. He used to go to the gym with his closest friend but stopped bc of school.

As soon as this guy moves in we start having problems with him.
He’s possessive and controlling of my friend. He’s verbally abusive to her. Did drugs openly, after we told him not to. Hes bullied me until I’ve cried even after I told him to leave me alone. 
All this, and they fight constantly. We’re talking screaming matches. Her behaviour is also starting to becoming very questionable. (This is important later)
It all comes to a head about a year into her stay (about 8 months for him). 

My 17yr daughter was cleaning her room and had a note on her door saying to leave her alone while she’s cleaning or she’ll stop cleaning. 
My friend and her boyfriend go into her bedroom and make fun of her and the sign.
She gets really upset and is crying.

I confront them about it and let loose on this guy. About the abuse, drug use, and that he was a guest in our house and he should behave as such. My friend says he didn’t say anything that bad and my daughter is overreacting and that I made her bf feel unwelcome.

My husband steps in and tells the guy that if there is any more fighting and they’re gone. Fast forward a couple of months and the fighting between him and my friend is still going.
This is where I might be TA.

I asked my friend and her bf to move out, over text. Let her know that we’re not happy with all the fighting and that she needs to find her own place now they’re both working (I do all my serious conversations with my friends, family and even my husband over text as I feel I can get what I need to say out better and im not over emotional) 

She got really upset with me and we have a huge fight (over text) about the blow up with her bf and how I didn’t respect our friendship because I asked her to move out over text. 

And this is the big one, a month or so prior, her son 19m came home one day crying hysterically. My husband and I sit him down and try and find out what the problem is. He tells us that he feels abandoned by his mother and hates how she’s behaving lately (she leaves without telling him where she’s going, doesn’t invite him to outings with her on weekends when she did previously, wasn’t there for support when his boyfriend cheated on him)
He decided not to move with his mother and her bf and was scared of her bf. 
We offered for him to continue to live with us instead. 

We told him not to tell his mother until we talked to her about moving out. I didn’t tell my friend that I had talked to her son, instead encouraged her son to talk to her about his issues with her. 

Now she refuses to speak to me (quite literally) and haven’t talked in months.

For some background information, I have always hated my step grandmother. She has always treated me unfairly since I was the only step child my stepdad had ever had. When I was younger she used to give my step siblings and my half sister lavish gifts and leave me with nothing, not that it ever bothered me because unlike her and my half sister I was used to getting nothing since it used to be just me and my mother alone. My step grandma would always have snarky remarks that were extremely inappropriate. Such as commenting on how my mother and I deserved the abuse from my birth father and how it would be better if my step father had never met us. She used to belittle me because I’m gay and I have several mental health issues I had been born with. She used to tell my half sister that she was so much better than me, and she would take any and every opportunity to compare me to her. My stepdad was way better than her, he would often redirect her but only so much could be done because she lived with us and she was his mother. My mother had always been an outlet for me to turn towards. She helped me with all my services and always stood up to my step grandmother but she passed away a few years ago from cancer. During my mother’s funeral my step-grandmother laughed. I was absolutely pissed and attacked her. My therapist later told me that people handle loss differently but I knew that she laughed because she found it amusing. She had never liked me or my mother.

My husband thinks I want a butler, I think I’m just expecting a partner.  
I am a female service member with a demanding job married to my veteran husband of 17-years. We have an elementary school aged child and he has been the primary caregiver and is an amazing dad.  He handles getting them ready in the morning (we eat breakfast together) and meets their bus after school, covers down on homework until I get home (approximately 2.5 hours later..usually 5:30-ish).  We’ve had blow-ups in the relationship before, generally concerning the division of labor.  I’m the sole breadwinner &amp; source of health care and have been for 15 years.  The longest he has held a job was 10 months, he total time employed since ‘07 is is 38 months.  He’s started and quit jobs and usually doesn’t last long because either we move or he becomes frustrated and quits because he has a fall-back (single income is doable, though definitely increases my stress-levels, I manage all the finances including our savings/retirement). 
We’ve been at our current location for 9 months, and I broached him finding a job/us looking for before and after care for the kid.  He let it break that he never wants to work again…complete shock to me.  We talked and I shared that if he wants to be a total SAHD, he needs to assume more of the work, both physically and mentally, to maintain our household.  I do 85% of the grocery shopping, all the meal planning, inventory household items, plan and execute most of the household maintenance.  He is an amazing attentive father, but he literally sits in a lazy boy popping CBD/delta-9 gummies watching YouTube and playing video games while the kid is at school, and maybe, if it didn’t inconvenience his gameplay, taking the dog for a walk.  I told him it’s generating some resentment from me and making me feel like I’m never winning because I can write to-do lists for him (but then I get to manage the household even more) or I can just do it myself.  He claims that he doesn’t notice the things that have to be done around the house, which could be true because of his own household dynamics growing up (mom = SAHM, dad = sole earner).  He accused me of only wanting him to be a butler.  I’ve discussed counseling, and working on communication, and what usually happens is he makes a token effort to do “something” but then gives up.  I seriously think he’s been depressed with no purposes since he left the military but he refuses to address it.  I feel like I’m almost in an abusive relationship at this point and being used.

I (Female 13) have two main friends I'll call them Jenna and dave.  Dave is very lonely because he left all his friends for me. Jenna is my gf and bi, she also has ADHD just like me, so we fit like two peas in a pod.  And dave has already established that he didn't want us to date. But one day she asked me if I can be her first girlfriend and I was ecstatic, so I said yes. Due to this I immediately knew I couldn't tell dave, but I knew that he would find out. And when I got a little bit closer to Jenna he physically pushed her away from me. I have already have made it very clear that I just want to be friends and that I'm a lesbain.  So he knows he can't date me, but he still gets really mad when a girl shows interest in me. And today Dave almost found out, his reaction when I said I might be dating Jenna was ""Jenna if you ask Molly (me) out I will yeet(p4nch) you in the stomach. Most people would just think he's kidding but I knew he is serious. He's done this shìt before. And I understand that he just probably feels like a third wheel, I understand that I'm his only friend and if he loses me he'll have no friends.

(I thought I was protecting her from the person I was back then, instead of changing). She went through a number of difficult relationships before marrying a friend of mine from High School. After 2 yrs, they got a divorce, and my marriage was on the rocks. We reconnected, but I didn't tell her how I felt because I was still married. Before my marriage ended, she ended up pregnant with her Ex, and they have been back together for a decade. I occasionally hear from her when he is being a jerk, but he and I rarely talk anymore, and he is not my biggest fan any longer. She reached out a year ago, and I have tried to keep things casual to keep him off my back. However, about 4 months ago, she said he was not comfortable with us talking any longer, and cut contact from her side, but stated she didn't want to let our friendship go. Last Friday I found out they are expecting kid #4. Part of me is happy that she finally seems to be in a happy healthy relationship, but for 20+ years everytime I picture old age or being happy she is the person sitting in my passenger seat, and ever time I close my eyes to sleep she is the person standing with me to face whatever my subconscious comes up with. I don't want to ruin the world she has built for herself, but I am struggling to know how to be a good friend while keeping a secret like this from her.

A new semester is coming up, and I have been thinking about changing my classes to get away from her. Why? Lately she’s been super negative. Every time she comes to lunch with me, she’s in a bad mood, and complains. Sometimes she even comes crying, which makes me want to just sit the whole lunch in the bathroom because I just can’t deal with people crying. She vents and complains about things 24/7. I’d be totally fine with someone venting to me, however, it’s every day and she doesn’t even ask me, she just sits down and tells me everything. I don’t think this is great for my mental health either, as being fed negative things all the time just seems to bring you down. I’ve struggled with mental health for a few years and this is not helping. I feel like she talks about the smallest of things and blows it out of proportion. Another annoying part is that most of her problems can be solved.

I know, it’s hard for lots of people to go out and make friends, but I can’t be her only one. I can’t sit with my other friends at lunch, because I have to be with her. She’s not willing to sit by anyone else either. I’ve recommending going to therapists to her, because I’ve done it and it truly helps. But no matter what I try to do, she pushes it away, as if trying to victimize herself. Going to lunch now stresses me out, and I’m nervous that she’ll be crying or in a bad mood when I sit down by her.

One recent interaction I‘ve had with her before went a bit like this: Me: “I’m kind of mad that I got a 9/10 on the test, I could’ve done better.“ Her: “Oh shut up, I got a 7/10, \[name\], you really shouldn’t be complaining.” I hoped she meant it in a joking way, but it did hurt a bit. When others ask me how hard a test is, and I say it’s easy, she gets mad because it was hard for her. I forgive her though. I know she’s always been jealous of my grades and try’s her best to match them. I think her family is a bit harsh when it comes to her grades, so I shouldn’t be mad that she’s mad I’m complaining about my good ones.

I feel horrible for thinking this, as if I leave her, she’ll have nobody. She’s in her worst time right now (I think), and all I want to do is leave? She needs me, and I’m scared that things will go down hill if I leave her. I’m her ONLY friend, and it only makes it worse that I’ve known her for so long. I’d hope that if I left her, she’d be forced to make new friends and be happier with more than just me. I want to hang out with my other friends, and not be bound to her. I can’t live with all her problems on my shoulder. But then again, she trusts and loves me, so I don’t know if I should be complaining. I’ve mentioned to her switching my classes, but she gets sad. She’s been nice to me, so I’m kind of flipping out inside. I feel like I’ll be an a-hole myself if I keep thinking these things.

Let me preface this by saying possible TW. 
Back in March of this year my younger sister (20F) had a miscarriage and shortly after in May i found out i was pregnant. Ever since then things between my sister an I haven’t been as good as they were before i got pregnant. I try not to bring up or talk about my baby or me being pregnant when i talk to my sister because of what happened to her. But every once an awhile i do mention things here an there because it is a huge thing happening in my life and this is my first pregnancy/ baby. My sister and i have always been extremely close so of course i want her support and i want her to be happy for me. But shes been very cold and distant since she found out i was pregnant. I 100% understand that what she went through was horrible and shouldn’t happen to anyone but part of me feels like shes mad at me for being pregnant and she isn’t. It was only earlier today that my feelings were confirmed that she doesn’t want me talking about him (my baby) at all and that “ive been inconsiderate because she had a miscarriage” this was all brought up when i asked her yesterday if she was going to come get the rest of her things out of her old room so i could move the baby and I into it when he is born in February. My sister moved out of my house over a year ago and left the room she was staying in completely trash then refused to come back and clean it out. So i had to do it, the only thing i didn’t clean out were her two closets packed full of stuff. I asked her 2 weeks ago if she could come clean them out because I need to use the room for the baby and I, and she blew me off. So i confronted her and told her that she needs to either come clean it herself or I’m throwing it all away and thats how this huge argument happen and some how turned into her telling me i shouldn’t ever talk about my baby with her. I simply told her that it’s messed up that she doesn’t want me talking about him and asked her what she was going to do when he is born. She deflected and told me I was acting like our late mother and threatened to block me, so I blocked her on all social media.

My first memories as a toddler was my mom getting in my face and yelling at me, my room was stripped (including my blankets and pillows) for getting detention in middle school bc of a tardy, and my parents removed my door because I had closed and locked it on them bc they were running after me to yell at me, I don't remember why.

Those are just some of the stories I have. I never had parents who just sat me and have a talk, I was screamed at all the time, called names, and told my parents marriage was happier without me.

I'm 20 now and I've been diagnosed with C-PTSD and am in counseling. What I went through as a kid/teen has caused issues for me in my adult life, and I cut contact with them after they continued to defend how they raised me.

Last night, I'm hanging out with my friend Hailey who came over to the apartment that I share with our friend Natalie. Hailey brought her boyfriend Tommy so the 4 of us were chilling on the couch watching Tiktok.

Tommy beings to talk about how parents in this generation are too soft with their kids + how kids are soft. I told him I disagreed and that I wouldn't be raising my kids with yelling and stuff and he's like ""So you're going to raise snowflakes who run your house""

I said ""No but I'm not going raise them in a way that they'll need to heal because of how I treated them. My parents yelled at me constantly growing up and I have trauma/lasting issues from it"" and Tommy replies ""That proves my point, you have trauma because your parents yelled at you once or twice? You're soft as hell, they should have been tougher on you"" 

At that point I blocked him out so I wouldn't say something I'd regret but he goes on about how his parents were tough/strict and how that was good for him and it's dumb to have trauma from that.

After Hailey and Tommy went home, I felt super frustrated, like I went through 18 years of verbal abuse and spend 100s of dollars every month for therapy only to be called soft?

Later I texted Hailey and basically told her I was upset by the things Tommy had said. She was like ""Yeah he says stuff like that, he's still an amazing man"" I basically told her, since she has said she plans to have kids with him, that I honestly do not see him being a good dad.

Hailey asked me what I meant and I said ""If he thinks not yelling at your kids will make them soft, and having trauma is soft then I'm afraid of the father he'll be"" She said still stands by the fact Tommy will be an amazing dad, so I just said ""I don't know, but if he thinks that being yelled at all the time is good parenting then he's probably going to yell at your kids and they're going to want nothing to do with him and likely resent you for not helping them""

I probably went too far but in the heat of the moment I felt hurt/invalidated. Hailey didn't reply after that and Natalie thinks I'm right about Tommy, so does one of our other friends.

The problem is; she wants VIP tickets that are being sold for €450 at presale. I don’t.

I’m a broke student who’s struggling to make ends meet while the cost of living keeps going up, whereas she has enough disposable income to pay for gigs, regular takeout etc. 
I explained to her how I can barely afford to make rent a couple weeks ago and now she’s begging to go to a gig with VIP tickets with me.
After nicely trying to explain being unable to afford tickets, she said she could pay for me.

I’ve always been from a low income background but I’m too proud to let people pay big expenses for me. I hate to feel in debt to people and worse to see money go on something I think could be much better spent.

I compromised saying I’d go but not VIP. She says she’ll pay and I want to say no. She wants to go to other stops too now and I dont know how say no again. 

Maybe I haven’t been forthcoming enough with her? I struggle saying no. 

She thinks I’m being polite, but really I hate to see gratuitous spending and I don’t want to be stood near barricade with crazy screaming fangirls ruining the whole night. Fan culture gives me the ick. 

I don’t want to knock her life choices, but I have no idea how else to explain it to her. 
At this point I don’t want to go at all.  I doubt she’ll go alone. Do I let her spend €1000 with fees on a night I’ll feel uncomfortable throughout, or do I bail out on her before money is spent and lose the uniting part of our friendship all because I hate over-spending and the rowdy fan culture she loves?

A new semester is coming up, and I have been thinking about changing my classes to get away from her. Why? Lately she’s been super negative. Every time she comes to lunch with me, she’s in a bad mood, and complains. Sometimes she even comes crying, which makes me want to just sit the whole lunch in the bathroom because I just can’t deal with people crying. She vents and complains about things 24/7. I’d be totally fine with someone venting to me, however, it’s every day and she doesn’t even ask me, she just sits down and tells me everything. I don’t think this is great for my mental health either, as I have anxiety and don’t want even more problems on my shoulders. In all the years I’ve had anxiety, I only have talked/vented to her about it once, when my grandpa died. I feel like she talks about the smallest of things and blows it out of proportion. Another annoying part is that most of her problems can be solved.

 I know, it’s hard for lots of people to go out and make friends, but I can’t be her only one. I can’t sit with my other friends at lunch, because I have to be with her. She’s not willing to sit by anyone else either. I’ve recommending going to therapists to her, because I’ve done it and it truly helps. But no matter what I try to do, she pushes it away, as if trying to victimize herself. Going to lunch now stresses me out, and I’m nervous that she’ll be crying or in a bad mood when I sit down by her.   


One recent interaction I‘ve had with her before went a bit like this: Me: “I’m kind of mad that I got a 9/10 on the test, I could’ve done better.“ Her: “Oh shut up, I got a 7/10, \[name\], you really shouldn’t be complaining.” I hoped she meant it in a joking way, but it did hurt a bit. When others ask me how hard a test is, and I say it’s easy, she gets mad because it was hard for her. However, I know she’s always been jealous of my grades and try’s her best to match them. I think her family is a bit harsh when it comes to her grades, so I shouldn’t be mad that she’s mad I’m complaining about my good ones.

I feel horrible for thinking this, as if I leave her, she’ll have nobody. She’s in her worst time right now (I think), and all I want to do is leave? She needs me, and I’m scared that things will go down hill if I leave her. I’m her ONLY friend, and it only makes it worse that I’ve known her for so long. I’d hope that if I left her, she’d be forced to make new friends and be happier with more than just me. I want to hang out with my other friends, and not be bound to her. I can’t live with all her problems on my shoulder. But then again, she trusts and loves me, so I don’t know if I should be complaining. I’ve mentioned to her switching my classes, but she gets sad.  She’s been nice to me, so I’m kind of flipping out inside. I feel like I’ll be an a-hole myself if I keep thinking these things.

I live in my son's dad's hometown and just a couple blocks from his mom. Because of this my son spends a lot of time with his other grandma (nana) and they're very close. My son still regularly sees my parents but it is a very different dynamic.

His nana picks up from school most weekdays, cares from him during school breaks, comes to most his sport and school events, takes him on all kinds of trips (museums, theme parks, beach, hiking, camping, road trips, vacations), and teaches him piano. He loves her house, has so much fun there and learns a lot. She also has 8 other grandchildren age 2-16 and is really involved with all of them, plus her youngest 2 children are still kids (15 &amp; 11). 

I would consider my parents, my nieces/nephews ""main"" grandparents, whereas for my son it's his nana. My mom has recently noticed this and is not happy about it. 

My mom came to stay for two weeks in October for my son's birthday and halloween. This is the first time she's seen my son's other grandma since he was 1. Although they got on well on the surface it is clear they are polar opposites as people and grandmas. Plus my mom is 67 and nana is 52. 

She wanted to look after him after school everyday she was here and take him to his extracurriculars. Son complained after the second night that she was boring and didn't do things right. I told him to suck it up, but by the next week he was complaining to my mom's face about wanting to be at his nana's. Both grandma's seemed to get on well enough for my son's birthday and birthday party, but the next weekend the 3 of us went to a halloween party at nana's and my mom was being borderline disrespectful to her. She got even more upset on the monday when son insisted on going trick or treating with his dad, nana, and cousins and told my mom that she didn't have to come.  

My mom got very upset over this and blamed me for her not having a good relationship with her grandson and saying I never let her spend much time with him and essentially keep her away from him. (She wanted him to spend a few weeks with her over the summer but I asked my son and he didn't want go, I'm not going to force my son to make my mom happy.) I told my mom that if she wanted to be sons favorite she needs to have more fun with him rather than just necessarily spend more time with him as my son finds her boring. I also told her she has to get over not being the favorite because it is unlikely to change. She was passive aggressive with me the next couple days before leaving. I messaged her to apologise but she hasn't responded. My sister's have suggested I was a little harsh on her.  

It's not my mom's fault she's not the favorite grandma but i still think she should suck it up?

I (53M) allowed my daughter's boyfriend (M24) to stay over for a night. Let's call him ""B""

B is a nice young man who has been courting my daughter for almost a year. He's spent plenty of time in our home but has always left within a few hours of being here. I didn't mind him in my home, he was polite ,(or so I thought.)

My wife had made supper, it was a chicken&amp; ham pie with some chips. B let me know it was kind to offer but he wouldn't be having any pie, but could have some chips. I let him know that fussy eaters weren't a thing in my house. He can have chips and pie, or nothing at all. To be petty and spiteful he chose the latter.  My wife went behind my back and made him some fish to eat. 

Because he was a guest at our table I had invited him to say Grace before supper, B said it was ""Against his religion"" this annoyed me because we're a Christian household and I assumed he was a Christian too as he'd often pray. 

My daughter got upset with me because apparently he's a Jew and she ""kept telling me that he doesn't eat pork"" 

I'm not a Jew heater or anything like that, but this isn't a restaurant where he can order anything he likes, and he can put his fussy eating habits aside for one night, as my wife worked hard to make the pie from scratch. I told my daughter and B just that. We (My daughter, wife and, myself) had a few arguments over it but eventually they calmed down.

B gave me an apology and I forgave him, and I thought that was the end of it. 

Last night things blew up again. We received a Christmas card addressed to myself and my wife, from B, and it said ""Happy Hanakka"" on it. He has done this out of disrespect and I have banned him from my household. My daughter and wife think this is a step too far but I disagree.

Disclaimer that I do not typically use Reddit or the internet very much but I have read a few posts from here just now so I hope my format is ok. My friend told me to send my situation so hello for when she reads this

Anyway. I (18M) didn’t get my high school diploma due to being expelled in January and I couldn’t go to another high school before the year ended. I am planning to go for GED but money is kind of tight right now so I have to babysit for money before I can. The reason I was expelled is because I had a psychotic episode at my school, and I was diagnosed with schizophrenia shortly afterwards. Nobody was injured during this but there was a lot of shouting and screaming and .. just really scary weird shit so you could imagine why I was expelled. 

So I decided to babysit because I cannot do what I need to do if I don’t get money. I am currently babysitting two kids (8F and 11M) pretty regularly as their parents are busy and I never have a lot going on. I have been doing it for 5 months now. The parents had to do a background check on me since I do it pretty regularly, and I lied to them and said I was having a gap year before college because I did not want them to know about my condition. They also asked me if I had any mental health issues and I lied and said no because I felt like it didn’t affect my ability to babysit and it wasn’t relevant.

Well when the kids were asleep a few days ago, I started hallucinating again. It doesn’t usually happen at their house but this one was really realistic. It was visual and audio and I ended up sitting in a corner in their kitchen waiting for it to pass. They got home not long after and I couldn’t really speak I was just shaking and sobbing.

I calmed down after a bit and I decided to come clean about it. I told them that I have schizophrenia and that I have had it this whole time and what I was just looking at. They were really upset and they felt lied to. The father said that I had put his children in danger and that he is very lucky I didn’t do something to harm them. I would never do this by the way. I was also told that I’m a very sick person and that I will never babysit for them again so. That’s fun. I said some stuff to them too, I told them to go fuck theirselves and that they can go to hell but nothing more than that.

I will be honest I am not on any medication right now (it does not work for me) but I had never had anything bad at their house and I didn’t feel like it was bad enough to disclose and it was none of their business. AITA? I feel bad because I feel like maybe they are right and I should’ve said it but I can’t tell if they are saying an objective truth or are just simply upset.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4854519,public,top,self,AITA for lying about mental health issues before I started babysitting?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zco3pl/aita_for_lying_about_mental_health_issues_before/,all_ads,6,,,

Before we moved in, we had extensive conversations about boundaries and rules in an attempt to avoid arguments/fights (spoiler alert: it didn’t work).

Long story short, it didn’t work out and we no longer talk to those two friends. However, something they said in the final argument has stuck with me and that’s where I’d like y’all’s input.

Before moving in, we discussed how to split rent as I felt it would be unfair for my partner and I to pay 50% when we would be getting less than half of the space. We were all in college at the time, so trying to fit a bed and two desks along with our personal items such as our TV, clothes, etc. quickly took up the master bedroom’s space. Additionally, the two friends had their own individual plates, cups, etc. while my partner and I shared them. At the time, the two friends seemed okay with splitting rent 40/30/30, if a bit frustrated but they didn’t fight my request at all.

Once everything blew up, however, one of the friends mentioned that everyone she had told about our rent payments said we were taking advantage of them and that whoever has the “master” bedroom should pay more in rent.

For context, recently she decided not to go on a trip with her friends which overlapped with her birthday. She was going to spend a day out with my girlfriend instead. She then doubled back, did not tell my girlfriend, and went away without the intention of saying anything. She then said something along the lines of ""it's not that big of a deal, plans change"". My girlfriend, also in the wrong and I told her so, decided not to wish her a happy birthday. Just a weird, immature interaction.

At the dinner table, with extended family attending, she bought up a smaller bickery argument which is not hugely relevant. Throughout this interaction, I was definitely also in the wrong. I was kind of joking, dismissing it because we are at the dinner table. She then stopped talking for a minute, and came back talking about ""my bitch of a girlfriend"" and how I ""do nothing and need to move out"". I again, in the wrong, made comments like 'what are you so mad for?', 'lots of pent up emotion', etc.

After that, I helped with the dishes and took my dog to the beach with my girlfriend, prior to the whole cake and singing ordeal. She behaves like this constantly, screaming matches, classic 'fuck off', 'piss off', even when she was 14 she would get into screaming matches with my younger siblings talking about how they have no friends etc. My younger sister took her clothes, still \~11y/o, so she proceeded to eat a bunch of her birthday candy and write a note saying 'don't take my shit again'.

I'm sick of the behavior, I refused to sit around and sing her happy birthday, and left. My family told me I should have been the bigger person and act like an adult, which I understand.

As it goes.. Am I the asshole?

&amp;#x200B;

I was dating someone for 2 years, happy and nothing seemed like it could go wrong, **BUT** we were long distance, we met over a streaming platform; we were suppose to meet 6 months after dating but then the pandemic hit. Of course, we wanted to still meet, so we waited to finally have flights open up. When they did, he obviously came here right away. I was really excited that my boyfriend was finally coming here to meet after a long and patient two years! I picked him up from the airport, and drove back to my place. Well here's the thing... to be completely honest, HE SMELLED TERRIBLE. I don't mean BO terrible, I mean full on **nose plugging terrible**. This was something that I've never been so turned off by about someone in my life and he was here for a whole week! SO, I thought okay maybe the person next to him on the plane smelled bad and it just lingered. However, even after showering, it was still there. It was in his clothes, even the ""*clean ones*"" right from his luggage. Just a terrible bad smell. I figured, okay I’ll try this maybe its just nerves and he’s just bad with sweating. I dont know. We made it through the week and he went home. I thought maybe it was just this time and I’ll keep trying because we had a connection but I just couldn’t shake it. 

&amp;#x200B;

When christmas time came around he was suppose to visit. He made an excuse last minute that the flight was too expensive and wouldn’t be coming. 

&amp;#x200B;

It felt like it was my way out. I broke it off with him right then and there with no real explanation as to why, just that it wasn’t working and I had too much going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

We’ve done a pretty good job of keeping him away from a lot of the sickness going around this year. Holidays are usually busy for us as we have my family, his mom/stepdad, and dad/stepmom’s houses to go to. It’s exhausting to do all in one day as his mom lives an hour away and his dad a few towns over. My mom and dad live on the block behind us and have been a HUGE help with the baby, watching him several times a week so I can shower/clean/sleep, whereas his parents have each asked to see the baby once in the two months since he’s been born (which I understand as they aren’t as close). I’ve asked my husband if this year we can go to my parents for Christmas and celebrate with each of his parents on whatever day they’d like, which gives us more time with them as well (a full day with each versus a few hours). I just don’t feel comfortable carting a newborn around to 3 different parties and exposing him to a lot of germs, especially when I’ve had to ask his family several times when they saw him to wash their hands before holding him and not kiss on him. They both are acting like I’m awful for not wanting to come on Christmas and wanting to celebrate another day with a smaller group to minimize the risk of him getting sick. I don’t feel like the actual date matters and he’s still so little driving around all day seems unnecessary. If he gets fussy at my parents it’s literally less than a minute drive home for us. I’ve double checked with my husband that this is okay with him, but his parents are only upset with me.

A little holiday history…
We have spent ALL holidays with his family for the past 5 years. Every holiday is a family feuds for one thing or another. It is very uncomfortable. My family lives so far away, it’s a trip to spend time with them. This year my husband and I have had planned to visit my family for Christmas and his for thanksgiving with our new little one. (Alternating holidays)
A few months into knowing our holiday plans, his mom told me she was planning a new destination family tradition during the Christmas holiday, which was an additional 4 hours from my family &amp; 6 hours from our home. I listened to the sales pitch of the event for just us girls and then she said it’s not that far from your family’s place… you could leave and come joins us. 
I told her I wouldn’t leave my family Christmas to drive further away from home. If you start a family tradition the whole family should be involved not just us girls and all should play a role in deciding what tradition it would be to make sure we all can enjoy ourselves.
She was taken back that I said no and didn’t talk to me for 2 months.

I have like $30 for christmas gift. I have to get gifts for my close friends, family and my boyfriend's family. So no one can really get something ""expensive"" from me.

Two years ago I found out my dad wasn’t my bio dad because I was dating a guy that had a daughter and my mom thought I was being a home wrecker (I talked to his ex wife and they we’re definitely separated) so that caused her to tell me? I had a talk with my dad and told him it didn’t make a difference to me.

However, I had dinner with my aunt and uncle (separately) and told them I knew and they told me what they knew. The story my mom told me was that she fell in love with a guy her age (17) and got pregnant, my grandma forced them to get married and she lived at her MIL for sometime but my sperm donor was a serial cheater and got some else pregnant around the same time and preferred her/wanted to live with her. So she went out and tried to make it on her own until she met my dad when I was 3.

My uncle’s story was that he didn’t really know the sperm donor but knew my mom really loved him. My aunt told me that my mom knew my sperm donor was married but still slept with him. At some point my mom told me a story about how an older man told her he offered to pay to “take care of us” in exchange for my mom being his girlfriend because he was having troubles with his wife and he was going to separate (according to her she refused).

I’ve always had trouble with my mom because she is controlling and wants me to be perfect. On thanksgiving, she refused to have my boyfriend over saying the house wasn’t guest ready but then the next day confessed it’s because we aren’t engaged (we’ve been dating 6mo) and she doesn’t want to meet “my string of boyfriends”. Even though they’ve forced me to introduce all my ex’s (2) for my “safety”. She ended up saying I had no self respect for sleeping around and being a slut and that pissed me the fuck off like how does she have a right to call ME a slut when she got knocked up by a married man? I told her I talked to my aunt (didn’t say what she told me) and that’s when all hell broke loose, whisper screaming turned to full screaming, shaking me, inciting me to fight her. She says I have no reason to ask other people about this and that I’m ungrateful for the sacrifices she made (my sperm donor told her to abort). She ended up kicking my out of her house (third time this year) and said to never show my face around again. Two days later she asked to see my and I refused.

I called my aunt the next day to confirm the story and she says it’s true, my parents knew, but that she told them it wasn’t contagious (per her doctor). I call my mom and dad upset (but mostly calm) explaining that they had no right to keep something like this from me as it relates to my son’s health. My point was that even if they didn’t think it was contagious (which may not be 100% accurate), they kept it from me on purpose to get what they wanted. They took away my ability to make my own risk assessment about the situation. I also told them it damaged my trust with them and that I would need time before I was ready to speak again.

Our other roommates include BF's mom, mom's BF and his son and his GF. We'll just call the son and GF John and Mary.  I wouldn't really say everyone is super friendly with each other, overall we all kinda just do our own thing. 

A recent work arrangement has caused John to have to travel for work and Mary decides she's going with him. This causes some issues because we all just moved in but basically the arrangement is that during the weeks John has to travel for work Mary will go with him and they will return whenever he has time off. Totally understandable, except for one thing, they have two cats. 

Now I don't like to get in the middle of things too often, but these cats literally just stay in their small bedroom all day and night, completely alone. If they had the run of the house this wouldn't even be an issue because usually someone is home. But according to John's dad they are to stay in that tiny ass room no matter what. Like I said John and Mary are sometimes gone for quite a while and I personally just feel like it's kinda abusive to do that to them. 

The main reason for the post is that since this has started happening I can hear the cats crying and scratching at the doors. It was breaking my heart so I decided to go in and give the cats some pets and cuddles and check and make sure they're okay. I've done this a couple times and made sure not to touch anything in their room besides the cats.

My BF gets a heated text from John today saying how it is super messed up that I went in the room without their persmission and it's an invasion of privacy. So I guess they installed some sort of camera. I feel pretty bad about it because I don't want to create more animosity between everyone in the house but I really didn't mean to do anything wrong. I just wanted to to make sure the cats were okay and not as depressed in their little room. I realize that if things were flipped and John and Mary were in our room it would be weird, but if I had a pet who I was leaving alone for a while and they checked on it I feel like it would be completely understandable on their part.

My boyfriend(38m) and I(20f) have disagreements about cleaning. 

He says that if there is cleaning that needs done that it should just be done, no matter who made the mess. But I disagree because I feel like I shouldn't have to clean up after a grown ass man. Sometimes it just feels like he gets lazy.

But he is a literal tornado. The entire house is destroyed right now because he dont put shit away when he is done with it. He just leaves it out. 
He'll put cigarettes out in dishes (cups, bowls, on plates), he'll leave food in/on his dish and put it in the sink instead of just rinsing it and putting it in the sink. He leaves his laundry all over the bedroom. 

I clean up after myself and put garbage in the garbage, I try not to leave my shit laying all around the place. I do have tendencies to be lazy but I ALWAYS clean up my own messes. 

But due to all this I literally refuse to clean around the house. I will not do dishes, Ive told him to just let me do the laundry when I want instead of him literally washing clothes every day of the week.

So now because he's impatient, lazy and messy, I won't clean the house because in my head it's literally all his mess, not mine.. and if he's not willing to compromise and just let me do shit my way when it comes to chores and cleaning, then he can do it all by himself.

The way our relationship works is I work and he does the household chores.

His sister, “R”, recently had a falling out with her boyfriend over something that I haven’t asked nor been told about (my boyfriend doesn’t know either) so she’s asked to stay with us, there’s no timeline set and we weren’t/aren’t in a rush to get rid of her.

The only problem is I’ve noticed things going missing like my socks and bras/knickers.

I’ve mentioned it to her, saying it’s odd has she seen them? I can’t see how they’re vanishing and she says no. 

I’ve asked her several times to check.

I can’t see how nearly all my underwear have gone missing so I quickly look in her draws, I didn’t dig through anything nor did I move/touch anything and straight away I can see four pairs of my underwear!

I spoke to her, in front of my boyfriend and all I said was “hope you don’t mind, got fed up running out of underwear and couldn’t see why mine were going missing! Think *boyfriend* was randomly chucking them in yours, obviously he doesn’t wanna sort our underwear so maybe we should?” 

Harmless, it stands to reason that’s why my underwear have gone missing and it’s whatever? I don’t want them back anyway, just want to avoid it in future.

She didn’t complain to me, but that night I overheard her complaining to one of her friends that I had no right to go through her draws and how I’d accused her of being a pervert, saying “I’m not even gay” which I never accused her of? So that morning I told her she’d made a bigger deal out of it, made me uncomfortable that she thought there was some implication there, that maybe our living situation isn’t working out.

She burst into tears and my boyfriend said she’s rightfully uncomfortable because I’d invaded her space and in the midst of a divorce.

They live in a another country so I don't visit them that often, around once or twice a year. 

While staying at my grandparents I got the news that my favourite youtuber Technoblade had passed away from cancer. Throughout the years I've enjoyed his content and he's had a big influence on my upbringing. When my grandmother found me crying in the livingroom she asked why? so responded that my favourite youtuber had passed away and that i very upset. She began cussing me out and telling that I in no way should cry over a person I hadn't even met and that that I was only allowed to cry over family and close friends. My grandfather even agreed. I was in shock. 

I tried contacting my mom and sister for advice on the matter but the only solution they could come up with was suppressing my emotions for the time being. My stay lasted for about three weeks more.

At my return home I had been mentally distraught over this because it felt like i couldn't be myself or express my feelings around them. I left me with this weird sought of trauma of staying at their place again. 

Fast forward to yesterday where my grandmother video-chatted with my mom. My mom called me over and my grandmother asked ""Don't you miss us?"". Here is where I'm probably the asshole. I said with a straight face ""No, I don't really miss you"". My grandmother really flipped on me after that and my mom ended the call soon after. She said I was in the wrong for saying that to them and that we'll only have a few more years with them.

So am I the Asshole?

I did not know him prior and I basically only roomed with him because my mom's friend brought up the idea. There's a lot of missing context in this post but I'll try to include some of it. For one we're paying 900 even though it was supposed to be 3 way split 750 each including utilities. The third guy (her other son) didn't come in until recently due to issues I cannot state, he comes in now but doesn't stay long. To my knowledge he doesn't pay the full side of his rent and his mom picks up most of the slack (even though he complains like he does). I'm not saying this to knock him or anything my mom also is paying my side of the rent since I'm in college, though we are kinda in the dark about how the split is 900. Originally I was supposed to get the master bedroom to justify the uneven split but he payed like 500 for a U-Haul to move in unannounced the day before to steal the master bedroom (I say steal because he knew the deal beforehand). If I were to guess he probably pays the last 300 of the rent and possibly a little bit of the utilities. He works like 2 jobs btw.

This brings us to the present. In the early days of August he would leave for work at 7 and turn off the AC entirely in Florida 90+ degree weather. I would wake up around 10 or so and turn it back on in the afternoon after getting home so I can not be sweaty in my own home. It was inconsistent so I'd only realize he turned it off way later when I wondered why it was so hot. He eventually stopped doing this a month or two ago. Instead he now sets the AC to 80 degrees constantly even though the outside temperature is still 80 degrees because Florida sucks. He complained to me back in summer that I needed to set the AC to auto instead of cool because the bill went up 100. Because I have no details of this I'm not sure if it's true or exaggerated.

 Regardless, imo it would make sense that the bill went up since I stay inside more often now, he stopped turning off the AC entirely for half the day, and his brother occasionally crashes here. So I ignored him and continued to set the AC back down. The other day, he complained when I set it to 76 and once again said the bill went up. I told him 80 is way too hot and he told me to get a fan(I already have a ceiling fan) in a slightly condescending way. I didn't say anything because I was tired but the next day I was completely pissed off. This foolishness doesn't save money and it makes the place stupidly hot and humid for no reason. Doesn't the humidity also promote mold growth? 

Am I crazy for setting it to 76? Am I being gaslit or something? I also want to note that on the one day it was 60 outside he had the AC on heat at 82.

I 36/F have been married to my 36/M husband for 10 years. He recently retired from the army after 4 years of service. 

We currently work together at a family business owned by my aunt and uncle that provides vocational training. My husband gets a lot of attention from female students because he is friendly, attractive, and reliable.  I worried about the environment for him because the majority of students are women between the ages of 18-45. He explained that students may flirt with him he is responsible for putting them in their place. He also said that I seem worried and asked me if I trusted him. I let it go for a while. He let everyone know that I was his wife and shut down any attempts.

A few months later during a family visit, he went outside to take a phone call in his car. I heard him say the name of a student. He also called a female student in front of me on his cell phone.  I talked about this with my therapist and she told me that I have every right to set a boundary when it came to phone numbers and texting of students outside of work etc. I confronted him and at the time he got defensive. We were able to communicate about some issues we were having and this stopped for a while.

About 3 months ago my husband kept talking about 1 student in particular. He apparently was giving her advice on how to get through the program and she listened. I didn't think much of it. Until we were all invited to a special fundraiser. He seemed overly friendly with her. They had a lot in common. He knew when she passed her license test, all about her new job offer, and other personal details about her background.  One time I saw a text pop up on his phone that said “I should be thanking you” from her at 11 pm at night. Another time I asked him to send me a picture of something he wanted me to buy for him. Her name came up as the most contacted.. He also saved her under her nickname. We both saw this at the same time. I left the house to get some air I pretended not to see it. I realized I needed to make sure I wasn't overreacting so I held my concerns in for as long as possible. I did not want to come across as the jealous possessive wife. He was always defending her, being protective, and advocating for her to our boss and to me. 

I finally had enough after she had another crisis and called him crying again. I told him it was nice that he is helping but I am disappointed in him for getting student phone numbers again. He explained she is experiencing some personal struggles. The only support she has is her school friend and my husband. She is married but she's been supporting herself and her 3 kids alone. I asked him where her husband is. He told me the husband is in jail.  She told her husband that my husband is keeping her positive.  My husband has had depressed friends and wanted to help her out.

Now coming to the reason I deleted the group. Before that, some context (family drama maybe) 

So my aunt is very weird. Over here we respect elders and involve uncles and aunts in decisions related to your son's wedding and my mum and dad has involved her in most wedding related decisions. 

Out of the blue, my cousin's (A's daughter) wedding also got finalized and the dates etc had been decided. Then on, the aunt started showing her true colors. She didn't inform my mother of any preparation that they were doing for wedding. No, my mum is not sore about it. And no, I didn't delete the group because of this. 

Then, today, some of my relatives came, and aunt arranged a small dinner of sorts. We are not a joint family but our homes are next to each other. There's one more brother, the youngest one who lives a little far from where my father and this aunt live. And it's not that we don't talk to each other. There still is active communication between our families. (In some cases in my country, brothers and their families can't bear the sight of each other, that's not the case with our families) 

To simplify, my mother (let's call her M) my (dad's brother's wife) aunt (let's call her A) and my other (wife of other brother of my dad) aunt (A2). The visiting relatives are my dad's cousin (B) and her family for her daughter wedding rituals. 

M and A have homes next to each other. A2 lives a little far, in the same town. A arranged a dinner of sorts as B and her family was visiting. She invited A2 and didn't invite M despite M living next to A. 

I live in a different town.. all other cousins are currently home. They uploaded all the photos and dance vids in a different WhatsApp group which is meant for wedding preparations of B's daughter. (Don't confuse with another wedding of A's daughter which led to change in behaviour of A).

I sent a voice note in B's daughter's wedding group saying Everyone's there, just my mum and dad aren't. 

Then, I went ahead and left this WhatsApp group and also deleted the WhatsApp group meant for my wedding.

Me and my brother didn't have a weird relationship or anything it was the typical sibling relationship with arguing. But we still had a lot of times where we got on. My brother was always my mothers favourite and this was no secret. She would let him get away with stuff I couldn't and was nicer to him ect. Me and my mother didn't get alone since she was abusive towards me and didnt like that I would stand up for myself when she would scream at me. This had no affect on the relationship between me and my brother until I moved out. Once I moved out we didjt have a lot of contact and would message hi to each other every few months if that. Until for my birthday I got a laptop so we were able to play games together like we used to. However this didn't last long at all.we had video calls on discord and had fun playing however he would make digs at me for seemingly no reason. Just digs like ""Well you are ugly "" ""your annoying I only play with you because you buy me things"" so one day I asked him if I had done something wrong. He told me I hadn't and said he was just annoyed over something going on with my parents. I assumed my mother was now being abusive towards him so I asked him about it and told him about some of the things he did to me. He got really defensive and ended up blocking me after we argued a bit. I didnt mean to upset him I was just concerned about him. After he blocked me I tried to log into my accounts I use to play games on and they were deleted apart from one I used a diffrent password for.  (We shared passwords as we would buy each other stuff for our games) I was really angry about this as one of my old accounts was from 2016 and had personal messages I didn't want to lose. On my other account some of the friends we played with asked me what happened between me and my brother. I was honest and told them he deleted my account and we don't talk. A few days later he posted something on a in game board (I wasn't blocked on this account yet so I could see it) and it said ""to the claims made yes I did hack her shes mentally abused me my whole life lol"" this really threw me off. Yeah we had arguments and I'm not going to lie there were times I would push him away when I wanted alone time however I NEVER abused him so It made me upset and angry that he would tell people that. The next thing ik my older sister age 27 messages me telling me to leave him alone and to stop picking on him. Again I was annoyed because I dont feel like I have picked on him. It seems everyone in this family is against me and I just want to move on and heal. I hate my brother as he is so rude and just entitled.

There is the main door entrance and right next to it is the freight elevator entrance (accessible with your fob key). About halfway down the block is an exit door (not accessible from the outside) that connects to a stairwell where you can take it to access any floor. I take the stairs down to this exit door when I have to walk my reactive dog so we can avoid taking the elevator. The door opens right onto the sidewalk so it is easier.

So today I got downstairs and was about to exit when I saw someone had left the door ajar by about an inch, and the door stopper was down. I opened the door, and kicked the door stopper up- had I just pushed the door open it would have stayed wide open because the door stopper would have dragged along with it. So after I kicked the door stopper up I let the door close securely shut behind me as I stepped outside.

All of a sudden I heard yelling to my left. I looked and saw a couple mean-mugging a door down. The woman was yelling at me saying I ""fn locked them out"" and that I should have left the door the way I found it, then she called me a stupid fuck. I was taken aback so I just ignored her. Plus I had my dog so wasn't getting into all that. They weren't definitively locked out, they could have just gone in through the main entrance. I guess they don't want to pass by the doorman. (This couple lives in the building btw, I have seen them in the elevator before and smoking outside the building over the past few years that I have lived here).

AITA for my action of closing the door? I live in NYC and it isn't safe to leave an unattended door like that open, we have a lot of homeless and other characters in the area.

Last Thursday one of Zoey’s teammates came up to me on my way to the locker room and told me about Zoey making racist remarks about one of MY OWN TEAMMATES, who I have been playing with since I was five. Apparently, Zoey has been talking trash about the varsity team for a while now but she let a racist comment about Jaz slip. She told the girls in the locker room that Jaz is only good because “black girls only know basketball and nothing else is in their empty heads” and that if she herself was black she wouldn’t be benched. I got really mad, so the next day before class started I yelled at Zoey and told her if she can’t handle being horrible at basketball then she should just quit. Today I woke up to a bunch of missed calls and texts from Zoey saying that I’m the reason she quit and I was being called a bunch of nasty slurs.

Mark and I have been together for 8 years, and while we have an amazing marriage, there have been issues with my mother-in-law, who I'll call \*Amy\*, since the day I met her.

Amy spent most of her life as an abusive alcoholic. Mark didn't even realize how bad the abuse had been until he was telling me stories from his childhood, and I had to tell him that being stripped and beaten at random for her entertainment was not at all okay or normal. I can also admit that the things Mark and his siblings had told me about their childhood, made me despise Amy before I ever officially met her, so I've never been a big fan.

Even though Amy has been sober for about 10 years, things weren't great between her and I at first. She didn't like that her son was settling down and creating a stable life with me and she hated me for it. Then came Aaliyah, and it seemed like Amy and I were getting along for a few years and she was actually great with Aaliyah. Then things between all of us got really bad around when Aaliyah had just turned 5 years old.

Amy wanted to keep Aaliyah overnight, and we agreed. When we picked up Aaliyah the next day, she told us Amy was mean to her and had been taunting her and calling her a baby, because she cried that she wanted to come home, and cried all night because Amy refused to call us. I know sometimes things like this happen, but we've always told Aaliyah we would never force her into a situation just to make someone else happy. Mark talked to Amy, and she admitted that what Aaliyah had said was true.  Amy apologized, we let it go but, Aaliyah has refused to stay with her since.

For years we brought Aaliyah over to Amy's house once a week, one of those times we asked her to watch Aaliyah while we ran to the store just up the road for a few things. When we came back maybe 15 minutes later Aaliyah was outside wandering Amy's apartment complex by herself. We were furious, got in a fight with Amy and have since stopped going there at all. We have however invited Amy over every week which she always refuses but will play victim and tell everyone in the family that we don't let her see Aaliyah.

Since we have found out I'm pregnant, Amy has been going on all over social media, about how she can't wait to babysit, and spend time with the new baby, and asking us when she'll get the baby all to herself.

He is pretty livid and not speaking to me since he had no idea we had that much debt.

For context, this credit card is mine only, it is in my name and I got it before we married specifically to pay for our honeymoon. Since then I've struggled to fully pay it off so I could close it, I tend to use it for randomly large purchases for clothes and gifts. I've never hidden the information, he knows I make payments each month around $300 or more, he's never asked for the balance. I also make significantly more money than him, and my credit score is fine, around 730 at present.

I apologized and asked him to forgive me. I offered to give him more clarity on the balance and show him my progress of paying it off from here on and to no longer use it. He said he needed to cool down and isn't talking to me.

He broke up with her because things just weren't right anymore (no cheating or anything like that). My best friend took it fairly well after the initial shock (she was also pretty unhappy in the relationship) and she always said how much more content she is. She also almost immediately seemed so much better than before - she seems much more confident and happy. But she always said very clearly that despite not being mad at her ex she doesn't want him to be part of her life anymore and therefore she does not want any of her friends to speak to him. Now, we all went to school together (him and I used to be friends before they got closer) and hung out loads together (the three of us) over the years until I moved a couple of hours away and I also always considered him a  good friend, so this request was not easy for me but she is more important to me so I obliged and never contacted him. When his birthday came round the first time after they broke up my friend asked me to please not congratulate him. This was a bit hard for me because we always used to call each other on our birthdays, and I felt really rude to not even message or anything but I respected her wishes and didn't reach out to him at all. He messaged for my birthday a couple of months later. I only thanked him and didn't engage in further conversation (he didn't try to either)  but it was so nice to hear from him and it made me feel bad for ignoring his birthday.

She says they’re very rude and its been going on for a while. 

She tells me about this regularly and has even asked them if they could be quieter (not in the nicest way) and they’re reply was essentially “f*** you”. So she went to the landlord and they got another warning. However, a few weeks ago she went out with another friend and got back pretty late.  As they were pulling into her complex she noticed a car with some guys in it that she hasn’t seen before (3-4 men) and as they were getting out the men got out of the car and all started walking towards her. Luckily, her bf was there in his car since he was coming over that night and he had his firearm with him so he grabbed it and also started walking over towards them, and when the men saw that they got back in the car and left. She has no clue who those men are still or what they wanted or were going to do, but she thinks they might know the upstairs neighbors. 

Jump to a few days ago she was again telling me about her neighbors, and how recently she started noticing that someone is putting stuff near her car and her front door. Just a little random things that seem like trash. She said one of the items left in front of her door was the lid to a shoebox. I am a fairly anxious person, so my first thought was that someone is probably watching her and she needs to be careful because being a single woman in the area that she’s in can be scary. Especially considering the event with the men coming at her late that one night. I told her she should throw it away because she said that she’s moved away from the door and it just gets put back, I told her that she should be careful, because even some thing as stupid as a shoebox lid can be a signal of some kind or some thing to the right person. She completely flipped on me and said that it was really f***ing annoying that i said that. I told her that was not my intention, but she stopped answering me. 

I don’t think I am in the wrong here, I just care about her and want her to be as safe as possible. And I know that thinking about stuff like that happening is scary, but I don’t think that it should’ve resulted in that kind of reaction.

She is coming home during christmas break and we are having a big family reunion. The plan is for her dad to pick her up and drive her home, besides being practical and safe, I felt it would be a good chance for them to have time alone. I don't drive and I will be too busy preparing everything for christmas anyway. I don't want to be worrying about her while I should be focusing on my christmas duties.

The conflict started when she told me she didn't want her father to drive her and that she wanted to travel alone. It would be bus ride from Connecticut to New York and she says it is not unusual for other girls at her school to go by themselves to their homes during breaks. The idea is horrible to me to the point of making me physically ill. I don't like travelling alone in the subway, I can't even imagine knowing my daughter is travelling across states by herself in a bus with strangers.

At first she framed the whole thing as she wanting to be more ""independent"" and being ""mature enough"", all typical teenage nonsense that I easily dismissed. But then she explained the real reason. Apparently, the last time her father visited her, the girls at her school went crazy about how ""hot"" my husband was and my daughter was heavily tease about it for months. She said that it eventually calm down but is afraid that he going there again will reignite the whole issue. I found her predicament very funny, to be honest, but I do get how a situation like that could be hard for a teenage girl.

I ultimately told her that her dad is going and that the discussion was over for all the reasons I explained earlier. She is really angry with me and says she is not going to talk to me while she is at home. I certainly love the irony of her being so angry at me and not at her dad who is the one ""guilty"" of her problem. She begged me not to tell anyone in the family, specially her dad, about the real reason she wanted to travel alone and I fully intend to respect that.

In total there are 5 couples and we’re all around the same age.  In the summer we all had the fantastic idea of going on a Christmas season ski trip in the mountains. 

My best friend Maddie\[31f\] broke up with her boyfriend two months ago, it totally devastated her and she’s still emotionally recovering. All of us girls got together two weeks ago to cheer Maddie up, she’s coming along, but still crushed. When asked if she still wanted to go on the trip, she said she’d love to, but seeing all the couples together would kill her, that gave me an idea. Afterward, I got together with the rest of the girls and I suggested we turn the couple’s trip into a girl’s trip to cheer up Maddie. 

We discussed it and knew the boys would be beyond furious, but it was for a good reason. We felt confident enough in our relationships at the moment that they could withstand one big selfish decision. We also decided to stand together so there’d be no single person to blame. Maddie told us to not do it, but we told her that it was happening and we’d take the heat for it. 

We told the boys individually, obviously, they were a combination of angry, and upset. My boyfriend in particular loves skiing, so this really hurt him. Look, me and my boyfriend always put each other first, always, but my bf is not the only person in my life that I love. I don’t mean that in a cold way, Maddie is my oldest friend, she’s my sister and she’s sacrificed so much for me and others in the group, we can make a sacrifice for her. And it says a lot that the other girls went along with the idea right away. 

Now obviously we have to make this up to the boys, and we’ll figure that out. The current idea is to treat them to a ski trip next year to Switzerland. In the meantime, while we’re on the trip they’ve been encouraged to hang out and curse our existence. Hell, they can do their own trip, but just not with us. 

I can accept that I’m an ahole, but I just want to know how much of one, if at all.

The rental market in my area is rubbish and I was working a temporary holiday job, with plans to move in with friends when they came back for the new semester. I put out feelers for temporary accommodation and a friend (Becky) said their parents might let me stay in her recently deceased grandmother’s flat.

They said they would be happy for the place to be looked after while they sorted out affairs to sell it. They gave me a discounted rate (still more than half my monthly earnings) and said just tidy the place so it was liveable. It was a bit dusty but otherwise still in great shape, except for having no hot water. 

They would send Becky’s bf Chad to fix the water and it would usually work for a day then dodge out again. I was bathing in water heated on the hob (or just freezing showers in the middle of winter), but Becky’s parents had done me a kindness so I never complained.

After a while they said I could stay indefinitely since they weren’t ready to sell. My arrangements with my friends fell through so I was relieved, but a week later they came back and asked me to be out in six weeks. I didn’t ask why, just panicked and hustled to find somewhere new to live. 

All this time, Becky’s parents would come by, often unannounced, and criticise my cleaning. I’m no slob but I was working six days a week, was down with covid for about two weeks, and lived alone so I wasn’t at my tidiest. This just meant a sink full of dishes, or lots of dust, weeds in the yard, etc. nothing horrific, justside effects of daily life. I said nothing except sorry.

I found a studio and called Becky’s parents to say I’d be moving out that weekend and be gone by their proposed date. They said fine, best of luck, etc. That weekend I got 99% of my stuff out and sent them a text to say I’d be back the next weekend for one last clean. They said ok so I spent that night in my new studio, had a hot shower and went about my week.

The Friday before I was going back to the flat I get a call from Becky’s mother and she’s screaming. How DARE I leave the house in such filth, I’m disgusting and ungrateful, they trusted me, I betrayed them, etc. I hadn’t been made aware they were coming over and reminded her I was back in the morning to tidy, but that wasn’t enough. Her sister was due to move into the house that week and I was insane for leaving it a wreck. They insisted I pay £150 for a cleaning hire but also that I clean to their approval. The bit about the sister was NEVER told to me, and honestly I was hurt. 

So I drove over in the middle of the night and rage cleaned the fuck out of that flat. It was spotless (not that hard because while it was post moving house chaotic, nothing was destroyed, ruined, etc.) I left the keys in the post box, blocked their numbers, and never went back.

I work at a theme park with a few rules. As with most of these places, too much rule-breaking will have you kicked out. 

Anyway, one of them is that while generally photo and videos are allowed, some areas are restricted. We have signs and warnings all over the park that informs customers which areas are restricted. But there were some entitled customers, some of them using sneaky tactics, that try to bypass this rule. I mean, I get it. It’d be nice to take a picture or video but rules are rules.

There was a mother with her two kids in one of the restricted area. She was a bit suspicious because she kept looking around as if to see whether someone was looking. Once when she made eye contact with me, she tried to move to a position in a way that was a blindspot for me. After a while, I then saw her reaching into her bag, taking out her phone, and doing that “going to take a photo” gesture. That’s when I told her “ma’am no photos please.” The thing is, because she was standing far from me, I had to shout it out which made everyone else in the room turn their heads toward her. I didn’t think much about it but, on her way out, she glared at me and said in an annoying tone that “I shouldn’t have embarrassed her in front of all the people.” So I told her, “well I wouldn’t have had to if you’d just follow the rule” by pointing the sign. She then said I’m making a false claim and that how could I have known that she was going to take a photo. She said she could’ve been doing something else on her phone. To which I replied that I saw her phone change to “camera” mode and from her gesture it was pretty obvious. Then she got even more mad and said that I still “didn’t need to yell.” Manager was called in. Though my manager sided with me about the rule breaking part, she did apologize ""on behalf of me"" for shouting at a customer. Later, while I was not written up or anything, my manager told me that I need to be more respectful next time. 

I’ve gotten mixed reactions from my coworkers. Some said that I did the right thing and it’s not my fault that she felt embarrassed. While some have said that the more polite thing to do was to approach and talk to her about it in a closer range instead of shouting.
